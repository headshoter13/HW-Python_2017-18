      "The Rwandan Civil War was a conflict in the African republic of Rwanda, between the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR) and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). The war was fought in two phases. The first phase began on 1 October 1990, with an RPF invasion of the north east of the country from Uganda. This phase ended on 4 August 1993, with the signing of the Arusha Accords. The second phase took place following the assassination of President Juvénal Habyarimana on 6 April 1994, and the outbreak of the Rwandan genocide. The RPF resumed fighting on 7 April, and the civil war ended with an RPF victory on 18 July 1994.\n",
      "\n",
      "The war had its origins in the long-running dispute between the Hutu and Tutsi groups within the Rwandan population. The ancient Kingdom of Rwanda, ruled by Tutsi kings, began implementing increasingly anti-Hutu policies in the 19th century, a trend continued by European colonial authorities from 1895. Both Germany and Belgium ruled through the kings and favoured the Tutsi. The Hutu population revolted in 1959, with the support of Belgium, which had effected a sudden reversal of allegiance. Hutu activists burned Tutsi homes, killed those who fought back, and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated state in 1962. The revolution forced more than 100,000 Tutsi to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. These refugees lived in exile for several decades, agitating for a return to Rwanda, but were not capable of mounting a serious attack. Some refugees, including future RPF leaders Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame, fought in the Ugandan Bush War with Yoweri Museveni, becoming senior army officers in 1986 under Museveni's presidency. Relations between the refugees and the Ugandans soured in the late 1980s with Rwigyema and Kagame demoted, but Hutu president Habyarimana refused to allow the return of refugees. This created a strong desire among refugees to return by force, so Rwigyema and Kagame used their military expertise to turn the RPF into a battle-ready army.\n",
      "\n",
      "The October 1990 invasion started well for the RPF, but suffered a reversal when Fred Rwigyema was killed in action on the second day. The FAR, assisted by troops sent from France, gained the upper hand and the RPF were largely defeated by the end of October. Paul Kagame took command of the demoralised RPF troops, withdrawing to the Virunga mountains for several months before restarting the war. The RPF began a classic hit-and-run style guerrilla war, which continued until mid-1992 with neither side able to gain the upper hand. The war led to a resurgence of violence against Tutsi in Rwanda, as well as the token introduction of multi-party politics. A series of escalating protests in mid-1992 forced Habyarimana to begin peace negotiations. This was a complex process involving his government, the RPF, the official opposition, and a group of Hutu hardliners. These hardliners opposed the peace process and disrupted the negotiations. They then initiated a massive wave of killings in early 1993, prompting Paul Kagame to launch a fresh offensive and bring the RPF to the verge of taking the capital, Kigali. Kagame decided not to storm the capital, however, and the two sides returned to the negotiating table with the RPF enjoying a strengthened hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "An uneasy peace followed the signing of the Arusha Accords in August 1993. RPF troops were deployed in Kigali and a peacekeeping force, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), was sent to the country. However, the hardliners were steadily gaining influence, and began planning the \"final solution\" to exterminate all Tutsi. The assassination of Habyarimana, whose plane was shot down as he returned from a regional summit in Tanzania, was the catalyst which began the genocide. Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 were killed, on the orders of the interim government led by Théoneste Bagosora. The RPF resumed the civil war once more, capturing territory slowly and methodically, encircling cities and cutting off supply routes. UNAMIR tried repeatedly to stop the fighting, but Kagame refused to negotiate unless the killings stopped. By mid-June, the RPF had surrounded Kigali and began fighting for the city itself, which they captured on 4 July. They then advanced northwest, forcing the interim government into Zaire and ending the genocide and the war. The victorious RPF assumed control of the country, with Paul Kagame as de facto leader. Kagame served as vice president from 1994 and as president from 2000, winning presidential elections in 2003 and 2010. The RPF began a programme of rebuilding the infrastructure and economy of the country, bringing genocide perpetrators to trial, and promoting reconciliation between Hutu and Tutsi. In 1996, the RPF-led Rwandan government launched an offensive against refugee camps in Zaire, home to exiled leaders of the FAR and millions of Hutu refugees. This action started the First Congo War, which removed long-time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power. As of 2018, Kagame and the RPF remain the dominant political force in Rwanda.\n",

       " u'development of the seriesedit  the pythons had a definite idea about what they wanted to do with the series they were admirers of the work of peter cook alan bennett jonathan miller and dudley moore on beyond the fringe and had worked on frost which was similar in style14 they enjoyed cook and moores sketch show not only but also one problem the pythons perceived with these programmes was that though the body of the sketch would be strong the writers would often struggle to then find a punchline funny enough to end on and this would detract from the overall sketch quality they decided that they would simply not bother to cap their sketches in the traditional manner and early episodes of the flying circus series make great play of this abandonment of the punchline one scene has cleese turn to idle as the sketch descends into chaos and remark that this is the silliest sketch ive ever been inthey all resolve not to carry on and simply walk off the set15 however as they began assembling material for the show the pythons watched one of their collective heroes spike milligan recording his groundbreaking series q5 1969 not only was the programme more irreverent and anarchic than any previous television comedy but milligan also would often give up on sketches halfway through and wander off set often muttering did i write this it was clear that their new series would now seem less original and jones in particular became determined the pythons should innovate  after much debate jones remembered an animation gilliam had created for do not adjust your set called beware of the elephants which had intrigued him with its streamofconsciousness style jones felt it would be a good concept to apply to the series allowing sketches to blend into one another palin had been equally fascinated by another of gilliams efforts entitled christmas cards and agreed that it represented a way of doing things differently since cleese chapman and idle were less concerned with the overall flow of the programme jones palin and gilliam became largely responsible for the presentation style of the flying circus series in which disparate sketches are linked to give each episode the appearance of a single streamofconsciousness often using a gilliam animation to move from the closing image of one sketch to the opening scene of another  writing started at 9 am and finished at 5 pm typically cleese and chapman worked as one pair isolated from the others as did jones and palin while idle wrote alone after a few days they would join together with gilliam critique their scripts and exchange ideas their approach to writing was democratic if the majority found an idea humorous it was included in the show the casting of roles for the sketches was a similarly unselfish process since each member viewed himself primarily as a writer rather than an actor eager for screen time when the themes for sketches were chosen gilliam had a free hand in bridging them with animations using a camera scissors and airbrush  while the show was a collaborative process different factions within python were responsible for elements of the teams humour in general the work of the oxfordeducated members jones and palin was more visual and more fanciful conceptually eg the arrival of the spanish inquisition in a suburban front room while the cambridge graduates sketches tended to be more verbal and more aggressive for example cleese and chapmans many confrontation sketches where one character intimidates or hurls abuse or idles characters with bizarre verbal quirks such as the man who speaks in anagrams cleese confirmed that most of the sketches with heavy abuse were grahams and mine anything that started with a slow pan across countryside and impressive music was mike and terrys and anything that got utterly involved with words and disappeared up any personal orifice was erics16 gilliams animations meanwhile ranged from the whimsical to the savage the cartoon format allowing him to create some astonishingly violent scenes without fear of censorship  several names for the show were considered before monty pythons flying circus was settled upon some were owl stretching time the toad elevating moment a horse a spoon and a bucket vaseline review and bun wackett buzzard stubble and boot flying circus stuck when the bbc explained it had printed that name in its schedules and was not prepared to amend it many variations on the name in front of this title then came and went popular legend holds that the bbc considered monty pythons flying circus to be a ridiculous name at which point the group threatened to change their name every week until the bbc relented gwen dibleys flying circus was named after a woman palin had read about in the newspaper thinking it would be amusing if she were to discover she had her own tv show baron von tooks flying circus was considered as an affectionate tribute to barry took the man who had brought them together arthur megapodes flying circus was suggested then discarded the name baron von tooks flying circus had the form of baron manfred von richthofens flying circus of wwi fame and the new group was forming in a time when the royal guardsmens 1966 song snoopy vs the red baron had peaked the term flying circus was also another name for the popular entertainment of the 1920s known as barnstorming where multiple performers collaborated with their stunts to perform a combined set of acts  differing somewhat confusing accounts are given of the origins of the python name although the members agree that its only significance was that they thought it sounded funny in the 1998 documentary live at aspen during the us comedy arts festival where the troupe was awarded the afi star award by the american film institute the group implied that monty was selected eric idles idea as a gently mocking tribute to field marshal lord montgomery a legendary british general of world war ii requiring a slipperysounding surname they settled on python on other occasions idle has claimed that the name monty was that of a popular and rotund fellow who drank in his local pub people would

       " u'style of the showedit  flying circus popularised innovative formal techniques such as the cold open in which an episode began without the traditional opening titles or announcements18 an example of this is the its man palin outfitted in robinson crusoe garb making a tortuous journey across various terrains before finally approaching the camera to state its  only to be then cut off by the title sequence and theme music  on several occasions the cold open lasted until midshow after which the regular opening titles ran occasionally the pythons tricked viewers by rolling the closing credits halfway through the show usually continuing the joke by fading to the familiar globe logo used for bbc continuity over which cleese would parody the clipped tones of a bbc announcer on one occasion the credits ran directly after the opening titles  because of their dislike of finishing with punchlines they experimented with ending the sketches by cutting abruptly to another scene or animation walking offstage addressing the camera breaking the fourth wall or introducing a totally unrelated event or character a classic example of this approach was the use of chapmans antisilliness character of the colonel who walked into several sketches and ordered them to be stopped because things were becoming far too silly  cupids foot as used by monty pythons flying circus  another favourite way of ending sketches was to drop a cartoonish 16ton weight prop on one of the characters when the sketch seemed to be losing momentum or a knight in full armour played by terry gilliam would wander onset and hit characters over the head with a rubber chicken19 before cutting to the next scene yet another way of changing scenes was when john cleese usually outfitted in a dinner suit would come in as a radio commentator and in a rather pompous manner make the formal and determined announcement and now for something completely different which later became the title of the first monty python film  the python theme music is the liberty bell a march by john philip sousa which was chosen among other reasons because the recording was in the public domain18  the use of gilliams surreal collage stop motion animations was another innovative intertextual element of the python style many of the images gilliam used were lifted from famous works of art and from victorian illustrations and engravings the giant foot which crushes the shows title at the end of the opening credits is in fact the foot of cupid cut from a reproduction of the renaissance masterpiece venus cupid folly and time by bronzino this foot and gilliams style in general are visual trademarks of the programme  the pythons used the british tradition of crossdressing comedy by donning frocks and makeup and playing female roles themselves while speaking in falsetto jones specialised in playing the workingclass housewife with palin and idle in being generally more posh the other members played female roles more sparsely generally speaking female roles were played by women only when the scene specifically required that the character be sexually attractive although sometimes they used idle for this the troupe later turned to carol cleveland who costarred in numerous episodes after 1970 in some episodes and later in monty pythons life of brian they took the idea one step further by playing women who impersonated men in the stoning scene  many sketches are wellknown and widely quoted dead parrot sketch the lumberjack song spam which led to the coining of the term email spam20 nudge nudge the spanish inquisition upper class twit of the year cheese shop and the ministry of silly walks are just a few examples',\n",

jesus christ  lust for glory which became the groups stock answer once they realised that it shut reporters up however they soon began to seriously consider a film lampooning the new testament era in the same way holy grail had lampooned arthurian legend despite them all sharing a distrust of organised religion they agreed not to mock jesus or his teachings directly they also mentioned that they could not think of anything legitimate to make fun of about him instead they decided to write a satire on credulity and hypocrisy among the followers of someone who had been mistaken for the messiah but who had no desire to be followed as such chapman was cast in the lead role of brian  the focus therefore shifted to a separate individual born at the same time in a neighbouring stable when jesus appears in the film first as a baby in the stable and then later on the mount speaking the beatitudes he is played straight by actor kenneth colley and portrayed with respect the comedy begins when

commemorate 30 years since the first flying circus television broadcast bbc2 devoted an evening to python programmes including a documentary charting the history of the team interspersed with new sketches by the monty python team filmed especially for the event the program appears with a few omissions on the dvd the life of python idles involvement in the special is limited yet the final sketch marks the only time since 1989 that all surviving members of the troupe appear in one sketch albeit not in the same room  the surviving pythons had agreed in principle to perform a live tour of america in 1999 several shows were to be linked with qa meetings in various cities although all had said yes palin later changed his mind much to the annoyance of idle who had begun work organising the tour this led to idle refusing to take part in the new material shot for the bbc anniversary evening  in 2002 four of the surviving members bar cleese performed the lumberjack song and sit on my face for george harrisons memorial concert the reunion also included regular supporting contributors neil innes and carol cleveland with a special appearance from tom hanks  in an interview to publicise the dvd release of the meaning of life cleese said a further reunion was unlikely it is absolutely impossible to get even a majority of us together in a room and im not joking cleese said he said that the problem was one of busyness rather than one of bad feelings31 a sketch appears on the same dvd spoofing the impossibility of a full reunion bringing the members together in a deliberately unconvincing fashion with modern bluescreengreenscreen techniques  idle has responded to queries about a python reunion by adapting a line used by george harrison in response to queries about a possible beatles reunion when asked in november 1989 about such a possibility harrison responded as far as im concerned there wont be a beatles reunion as long as john lennon remains dead32 idles version of this was that he expected to see a proper python reunion just as soon as graham chapman comes back from the dead but added were talking to his agent about terms33  the pythons autobiography by the pythons 2003 compiled from interviews with the surviving members reveals that a series of disputes in 1998 over a possible sequel to holy grail that had been conceived by idle may have resulted in the groups permanent split cleeses feeling was that the meaning of life had been personally difficult and ultimately mediocre and did not wish to be involved in another python project for a variety of reasons not least amongst them was the absence of chapman whose straight manlike central roles in the grail and brian films had been considered to be an essential anchoring performance apparently idle was angry with cleese for refusing to do the film which most of the remaining pythons thought reasonably promising the basic plot would have taken on a selfreferential tone featuring them in their main knight guises from holy grail mulling over the possibilities of reforming their posse the book also reveals that a secondary option around this point was the possibility of revitalising the python brand with a new stage tour perhaps with the promise of new material this idea had also met with cleeses refusal this time with the backing of other members  march 2005 had

is the killer  the nsa team and rudolph arrive telling the sheriff a story about a psychotic rogue operative imprisoned in a military psychiatric unit who escaped and is committing the murders he does not believe them but goes back to the office and frees john kristin tommy theresa and he plan to go on a trip the next morning  the nsa set up base at a watertreatment center they use radar to find where the snake is likely to be then have the police set up a perimeter to keep people out of the zone believing the snake to be sleeping the team wastes most of its ammunition on the snakes shed skin agent parker realizes the snake set them up using its skin as a decoy the snake arrives and kills the team only rudolph survives after keeping himself standing perfectly still in front of the creature  theresas morning shower is interrupted by the snake though she is able to escape the snake eats tommy theresa drives away but the snake follows it gets in front of her and rips the rear axle off disabling the truck she gets away again and hides in a crevice  when tommy and theresa do not arrive to pick them up john and kristin go looking for them finding the wrecked truck theresa tries to warn them as the snake comes to attack but they cannot hear her john and kristin escape using tommy and theresas bikes from the truck they make it to the watertreatment center where theresa later joins them and find rudolph in shock the group realizes that they must do something about the snake or it will get to the town they call greg on the radio and fill him in on a plan they have devised  they lure the snake into the watertreatment plant by having it chase john through a shaft while they set a bomb near the entrance kristin drops a line down another shaft for john to escape the other two escape through the regular door where greg is waiting to drive them to the other shaft they pull john out and the python is unable to climb up the shaft trapped in the tunnel the python returns to the doorway entrance the group returns to the entrance to trigger the bomb but it does not detonate rudolph says the snake must have torn out the antenna when it crashed into the bunker so he leaves his pet snake with kristin and runs back in to reset it while rudolph resets the charges he is confronted by the snake but is able to succeed in his task the charges go off killing rudolph and the other four are celebrating their success but the python emerges unscathed  they flee in gregs police car and come up with a new plan to penetrate the snakes hide by luring the snake into a vat of acid at johns plating plant once there john acts as the bait once again while kristin uses a winch to push the snakes underbelly into one of the vats causing the snake to be disemboweled and killed by the acid  six months later greg has been accepted into quantico to be an fbi agent the plant has been reopened as a barbike shop where the snakes skin is used as a sales tool and john finds out that kristin and he are soon to be parents',\n",

       " u'statements and control flowedit  pythons statements include among others   the assignment statement token = the equals sign this operates differently than in traditional imperative programming languages and this fundamental mechanism including the nature of pythons version of variables illuminates many other features of the language assignment in c eg x = 2   translates to typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2 the righthand value is copied into an allocated storage location for which the lefthand variable name is the symbolic address the memory allocated to the variable is large enough potentially quite large for the declared type in the simplest case of python assignment using the same example x = 2   translates to generic name x receives a reference to a separate dynamically allocated object of numeric int type of value 2 this is termed binding the name to the object since the names storage location doesnt contain the indicated value it is improper to call it a variable names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types including strings procedures complex objects with data and methods etc successive assignments of a common value to multiple names eg x = 2   y = 2   z = 2  result in allocating storage to at most three names and one numeric object to which all three names are bound since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed data type with it however at a given time a name will be bound to some object which will have a type thus there is dynamic typing  the if  statement which conditionally executes a block of code along with else  and elif  a contraction of elseif  the for  statement which iterates over an iterable object capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block  the while  statement which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true  the try  statement which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except  clauses it also ensures that cleanup code in a finally  block will always be run regardless of how the block exits  the class  statement which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class for use in objectoriented programming  the def  statement which defines a function or method  the with  statement from python 25 released on september 200657 which encloses a code block within a context manager for example acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards or opening a file and then closing it allowing resource acquisition is initialization raiilike behavior and replaces a common tryfinally idiom58  the pass  statement which serves as a nop it is syntactically needed to create an empty code block  the assert  statement used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply  the yield  statement which returns a value from a generator function from python 25 yield  is also an operator this form is used to implement coroutines  the import  statement which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program there are four ways of using import import <module name>  or from <module name> import   or import numpy as np  or from numpy import pi as pie    the print  statement was changed to the print  function in python 359  python does not support tail call optimization or firstclass continuations and according to guido van rossum it never will6061 however better support for coroutinelike functionality is provided in 25 by extending pythons generators62 before 25 generators were lazy iterators information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator from python 25 it is possible to pass information back into a generator function and from python 33 the information can be passed through multiple stack levels63',\n",
       " u'expressionsedit  some python expressions are similar to languages such as c and java while some are not   addition subtraction and multiplication are the same but the behavior of division differs there are two types of divisions in python they are floor division and integer division64 python also added the   operator for exponentiation  from python 35 the new   infix operator was introduced it is intended to be used by libraries such as numpy for matrix multiplication6566  in python ==  compares by value versus java which compares numerics by value67 and objects by reference68 value comparisons in java on objects can be performed with the equals  method pythons is  operator may be used to compare object identities comparison by reference in python comparisons may be chained for example a <= b <= c    python uses the words and   or   not  for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic    ||     used in java and c  python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension python 24 extended list comprehensions into a more general expression termed a generator expression45  anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions however these are limited in that the body can only be one expression  conditional expressions in python are written as x if c else y  69 different in order of operands from the c  x  y  operator common to many other languages  python makes a distinction between lists and tuples lists are written as 1 2 3   are mutable and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries dictionary keys must be immutable in python tuples are written as 1 2 3   are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries provided all elements of the tuple are immutable the +  operator can be used to concatenate two tuples which does not directly modify their contents but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples thus given the variable t  initially equal to 1 2 3   executing t = t + 4 5  first evaluates t + 4 5   which yields 1 2 3 4 5   which is then assigned back to t   thereby effectively modifying the contents of t   while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts70  python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to a variable a writable property etc are associated in the identical manner to that forming tuple literals and as a whole are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement the statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the leftcitation needed  python has a string format operator    this functions analogous to printf  format strings in c eg spam=s eggs=d  blah 2  evaluates to spam=blah eggs=2   in python 3 and 26+ this was supplemented by the format  method of the str  class eg spam=0 eggs=1formatblah 2   python 36 added fstrings blah = blah eggs = 2 fspam=blah eggs=eggs  71  python has various kinds of string literals  strings delimited by single or double quote marks unlike in unix shells perl and perlinfluenced languages single quote marks and double quote marks function identically both kinds of string use the backslash     as an escape character string interpolation became available in python 36 as formatted string literals71  triplequoted strings which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks they may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells perl and ruby  raw string varieties denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r   escape sequences are not interpreted hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common such as regular expressions and windowsstyle paths compare    quoting in c   python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists denoted as akey   astartstop  or astartstopstep   indexes are zerobased and negative indexes are relative to the end slices take elements from the start index up to but not including the stop index the third slice parameter called step or stride allows elements to be skipped and reversed slice indexes may be omitted for example a  returns a copy of the entire list each element of a slice is a shallow copy  in python a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced in contrast to languages such as common lisp scheme or ruby this leads to duplicating some functionality for example   list comprehensions vs for  loops  conditional expressions vs if  blocks  the eval  vs exec  builtin functions in python 2 exec  is a statement the former is for expressions the latter is for statements  statements cannot be a part of an expression so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions all being expressions cannot contain statements a particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a = 1  cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement this has the advantage of avoiding a classic c error of mistaking an assignment operator =  for an equality operator ==  in conditions if c = 1     is syntactically valid but probably unintended c code but if c = 1   causes a syntax error in python',\n",
