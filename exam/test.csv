0,Aquarius,"                 ... I'll be right there waiting.... waiting for you.. But will you be waiting for me?   I doubt it. I meet so many people. I feel so much pain. I love them.. without asking for anything in return. Maybe that is wrong of me.. cuz they didn't ask me to love them. And no matter what happens, how mad, or sad, or upset I get, I'll still love them, unless I find out they've done something extremely evil. I can forgive most things, a little dishonesty, cheating (though I'd not date that person again), stealing.. etc...  Its hard to explain... each circumstance is different. I could never forgive, sexual assault, or the molestation or injury of a child.. and of course, not rape either.  But.. I know people who think badly of me.. because I cut. I would never judge them, if they did the same. I'd never judge them, if they smoked, or drank too much, or were even addicted to video games, or porn.  WHY?? Why do they have to judge me? I don't understand, I don't comprehend....     Read.. below.. an example:   5/21/2004  7:08:56 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  yeah.. since they made me a cashier... i like that so much better.. my mood has improved.. like 220%....  5/21/2004  7:09:02 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  but.. i'm not really doing soo good overall  5/21/2004  7:09:08 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  i've beeen.. you know  5/21/2004  7:09:29 PM  Izu!  Exalted Angel  Same as always, huh? Glad works better for you.  5/21/2004  7:10:23 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  what do you mean? um.. its that week.. right now.. where i get really upset...  5/21/2004  7:10:34 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  and.. ... I've been cutting.. and I dont really understand why  5/21/2004  7:10:55 PM  Izu!  Exalted Angel  ...   5/21/2004  7:12:23 PM  Izu!  Exalted Angel  I'm really not sure what to say to that Julie.  5/21/2004  7:12:32 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  you dont have to say anything  5/21/2004  7:12:40 PM  Izu!  Exalted Angel  Then I don't think I will.  5/21/2004  7:12:52 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  umm..  5/21/2004  7:15:30 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  you think badly of me.. when I say things.... like that dont you  5/21/2004  7:16:29 PM  Izu!  Exalted Angel  Pretty much. It makes me want to stop talking with you, because I can't help you, can't save you, can't change you , and all I can do is sit back and watch the fireworks as you self-destruct.  5/21/2004  7:18:15 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  then pretty much.. .. I just shouldnt share with you, because.. its not really ur concern.... and I'm sorry I did  5/21/2004  7:20:23 PM  Izu!  Exalted Angel  It's not that. It's that it's a broken record. Same thing over and over. Look, I'm all for you sharing, and all for you expressing yourself. Always going back to the subject of cutting, or wanting to cut, or actually cutting. Then saying you don't know why, or how you can't help it.  5/21/2004  7:21:01 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  just dont worry about it ok  5/21/2004  7:21:06 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  i'll leave you alone from now on  5/21/2004  7:21:16 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  you dont have to worry.. or think.. or have me bothering you  5/21/2004  7:21:35 PM  Izu!  Exalted Angel  Alright   They thing that is the worse.. is .. I hardly talk to this person about cutting, or even mention it to him.  The thing is.. I used to date him, and he told me...  well... if I cut while we were dating, then it was over.  How could you say that to someone you care about?   I wrote another poem... this morning...    My love for you is strong, Believe this,  though we've not known  each other for long.   Each day my thoughts think of you, I want you more and more each day, What will I ever do?   A kiss, a whisper, I love you, beautiful words, full of love, Where did you come from?  Where you sent from above?   I don't want to lose you, for fear of a short life. I will always love you, Wishing someday, to become your wife.    Talked quite abit with EPB last nite. Especially about the whole wanting to break up thing. We talked thru it. I still don't know how much I can handle a relationship, but being without him, somehow seems worse. He gives me something to look forward to, something to dream about. He gives me inspiration, he doesn't lecture me on my cutting, because he so knows, he never went to any of the extents that I did, but he used to self injure. I feel he can relate more. He always is very sootheing and loving, wishing he was here, to help me thru my rough times. Though, it did hurt when he told me his heart is mostly hollow, because of his past.    His friends wanted to go to a strip club tonite. He said.. he really didnt want to go, cuz all that are there are scanky women, and the only woman he wants to see is me.  I told him he sounded pussywhipped, and in a way he did. I wouldn't mind if he goes... cuz.. I know, I have his heart....  and they have nothing, not even his respect.    There is so much more I could say, but not sure where to start, I started as a cashier today, and will be working on my own tommorrow..  a little nervous, but much more confident. I enjoyed my day at work, though it was long and tiring.                     "
1,Sagittarius,"        Munday  Not such a bad monday, as monday's go.  Called the Child Support Division bright and early this morning to find out the status of that bond payment DBD payed at the beginning of August.  Still waiting on that nice little chunk of change and wanted to know when I could expect it in my pocket.  Turns out whoever was supposed to set the court date didn't set the court date.  Now the lady I spoke to has to contact the legal department to get the date set.  I can't get my grubby little hands on that money until the judge releases it to me.  i'm thinking some little date-setter had a nice little shopping spree with my money!  Anyway, it would appear that I now have the wheels in motion, and maybe I'll get a notice in the mail or something.    Figures now that the mercury retrograde is over things are starting to move along.  Diva out.           "

3,Virgo,"                 Dammit SIAC really really sux. They didn't have any hot water so i had to come home for a shower, evil evil evil. I blame this on the government, they should put more money into the olympic park venues, yeah i kno they're pretty much redundant but i don't care. They should at least keep hot showers going for people who go there regularly like me. I'm stressing over the amount of homeword, assessment task and test that i have managed to rack up over the past 2 weeks. Somehow, by no fault of my own,  i find myself trying to complete them all this weekend as they're due next week.       "
4,Leo,"       So I was at church Sunday and I was having one of those day that I didn't want to be there.  I was daydreaming and doing all the stuff that I shouldn't be doing in church (nothing bad just not paying any attention.) So I grabbed one of those cards that you fill out and put in the offering so they know that you were at church, and I started to fill it out.   I put my name on it  and then my phone number, then my address and city, then I came down to the part where you check on of the boxes to tell what you are in the church or if you are a visitor or what ever.  Well I was thinking on what I should put and I ended up marking the box: I WOULD LIKE TO BECOME A CHRISTIAN.  And I was thinking I can tell people that I am a christian but deep down I know that I don't act like one ( I have been saved but I still don't feel like one) I know that from time to time you are not going to feel like a christian but I think the only time I really feel like a Christian is when I do something in gods name for somebody and that is not to often.  I feel good about myself but I don't feel like a Christian.  I know that there is nothing wrong with feeling like that but to me there is something wrong with it because I know that I can do better then what I am doing but I just don't try.  And I think that there are other people around me that think that they could be better Christians and I hope that every day you try to become a better Christian.     Cates         "

9,Gemini,"       Good evening all  ah what a stressful week its going to be! I worked 3 to 10 tonight, and it was busier than expected and the new girl doesnt seem to understand that talking on the phone for an hour is not acceptable.   There is a slight (but serious) miscommunication between a few people which includes the assumption that i drove myself home drunk a couple weeks ago. Which entirely is not factual. here are a few reasons: - i dont drink - even if i did choose to drink, i had friends with me that would take possesion of my keys before i even thought of putting my shoes on to leave the house. (thank you mike)  - lastly, im more intellegent than that.   just thought i'd clear that up.   And much love goes to jamie for lookin out for me and making sure that i get punched in the face if that would ever happen =D thanks!

13,Aquarius,"       I hate having a cold, especially when the weather is warm.  My head is clogged and nose is stuffed.  I just want my bed.  HMMMMM, my bed.  Must. Get. To. Bed.  Right after some meetings at school with parents who probably won't show up and I'll just be sitting around twittling my thumbs and wishing for my bed.  2 of my 3 meetings scheduled for this morning already didn't happen.  2 more non-meetings to go, then home and bed and tv and orange juice.

14,Cancer,"           My puzzle was put together, but someone broke it. Funny how it feels like only this one person can put it together. It was so real.... and now it's fading... fading out of my hands. How do I not lose this?       Pieces of Me On a Monday, I am waiting Tuesday, I am fading And by Wednesday, I can't sleep Then the phone rings, I hear you And the darkness is a clear view Cuz you've come to rescue me  Fall... With you, I fall so fast I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you've known me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  I am moody, messy I get restless, and it's senseless How you never seem to care When I'm angry, you listen When youre happy, it's a mission And you wont stop 'til I'm there  Fall...

16,Leo,"                 It took me almost five days to get motivated enough to post my thoughts about ending my first week of exams.  I think my previous post 'Panic' pretty well sums up my feelings on my Criminal Law exam, so I guess now I need to reflect on my Torts exam.    As you know, my Torts final was a 48-hour take-home essay exam.  At my last post I was 18 hours into the exam, and hadn't done much with it except write down page numbers of various cases I wanted to use.  Big mistake.  I didn't really even get started until around 1:30 that day, giving me about 24 hours in which to complete 10 questions.  Big mistake.  Big mistake!!  I slept for about 2 hours that day, but I finished.  I turned it in (13.5 pages) with 10 minutes to spare.  I think my printer worked slower than ever that day -- I was worried that I wouldn't make it on time.    You'd think that most normal people would immediately go home and take a nap.  Nope, not me.  My group of friends already had a party going across the street from school (it started around noon, for the non-slackers who turned their papers in early).  We consumed lots of beer and played some silly games.  Some of the guys swam in a little kiddie pool.  We then went to a bar on St. Pete Beach for the remainder of the night.  I haven't been posting because pretty much all I've done since that night is sleep.  Off and on at least, intermingled with some driving, shopping, and eating.  But I've slept more since Friday than I had in probably three weeks.  It's been great.  Really great.  I'm still not feeling motivated to do much of anything...but luckily I don't have to feel guilty about it anymore.  All I have to do now is sit and wait for my grades.  The professors have until Aug 9 -- the waiting is going to be just-so-much-freaking-fun, I-love-having-to-check-every-single-day-for-three-weeks.  Vomit.    When I get so inspired (hopefully tomorrow), I'll post some general thoughts about my first semester.  I promise it won't be another five days -- I have no more excuses!  :)               "
17,Scorpio,"              Jazz and the Charleston  Oooh..went to watch  urlLink The Cat's Meow   starring Kirsten Dunst, Cary Elwes and also Edward Hermann, Rory's grandad in Gilmore Girls, who plays William Randolph Hearst, the 1920s newspaper titan. Quick trivia: Did you know that Citizen Kane was supposedly based on his life (Hearst I mean, not Hermann).  The Cat's Meow is based on the novel written by Elinor Glyn, about what really happened on a yachting trip in 1924. Actually, 15 November 1924, to be exact - hehe my birthdate! ooooooooh...  Movie and the webstie have really nice 1920s-style songs...it's actually playing in the BG as I type. And the Charleston dances they did seemed pretty funky too hehe.  Am plannign to watch Lilo n Stitch later, prob at Highpoint. Some lighthearted 'toon eh to jazz up the week. Man, I've really been watching lotsa movies these couple of days...prob to make up for the months of abstinence hehe.  okies, cheerio.

18,Aries,           I am still smoke-free...my last cigarette was Thursday night/Friday morning at midnight.  It was rather lackluster.  I only finished half of it.  I think the fact that I'm all kidney-ed out made it easier to quit.          
19,Aquarius,"                 I hate the pain of life, of living. These are the time, I sometimes wish I was dead. I can't stand the emotions, that flutter thru my mind, my soul, my heart. I don't know how to handle the pain. I don't know what to say. I don't know how to share. I just want it all to stop.   I can probably say I am doing better in my life, because I am NOT going to kill  myself today. I will have to fight the feeling though. It will be hard... It is extremely overwhelming now.  I told C. over the weekend about the whole thing with I.  I didn't know how he'd reacte, and I guess even though I told him, I still don't know. He's always so quiet. I guess I use sarcasm more than I've ever realized. He pointed that out to me, so I will have to learn to note that to  myself, so I can try to change that bad habit. It hurts though. I don't like feeling stupid. I feel that we are argueing, and then he says things I don't understand.   Now I am about in tears, trying to cry for fear of letting it hurt more.  This is something I will always remember, C. Says 'i've never regreted whatever i've been doing in my life so far', then says 'please,...PLEASE,don't make me this time' And I say, 'please what  honey?' and then it hits me.. he is talking about us.. and our relationship. and then I say' Regret what? us?'and he says yes.  I feel like I was just stabbed in the chest. I'm about in tears. I only fear the tears because my grandma and daughter are in the next room, and I don't want to share my pain with them.  I am starting to think maybe getting off the meds was a bad idea. Now I am thinking more clearly, and I keep more things in my head and I don't like this. I don't like feeling this pain. At least with the medication I was mostly numb. I don't know how to handle stress. I don't know how to live in the real world. How do I do it, How do I survive. Survive without the knifes, the blades, and pills.  I'm hoping writing is the key, writing and sharing. So far it is starting to work, but it can't solve all my problems.                "

21,Aquarius,"                 Weird Day  Hey, Karon! Glad to see you back online! That's hilarious about your NKOTB stuff, and I can't wait to see you in the t-shirt!  Well, my day yesterday was weird. Not bad, just weird. There was a string of things that just didn't quite go right and there was nothing I could do about it. That's when you just shrug your shoulders and chalk it up as a weird day. I was supposed to go to lunch with someone and they forgot. I went to pick up my contacts and they weren't in yet (been wearing my glasses for a week). Talked on the phone with someone and I knew they were frustrated and I didn't know what to do to help. Oh, well. Mama said there would be days like that!  There were some bright spots in the day, however, and they outshone the weirdness!! My women's Life Group in the morning went really well. I'm enjoying our study and there are two gals I'm getting to know better. It's been just wonderful! Then last night we had our couples small group. That group is always a riot; we laugh so much! I had a chance to chat briefly with one of the gals in the couples group who has been wrestling through some issues with her faith. I had been wanting to chat with her because I had a hunch that she was walking a path similar to one Ked and I walked a few years ago. Last night I mentioned a few things and her eyes lit up with relief that she wasn't the only one. It felt good to offer her some encouragement and let her know she's not alone. When we left, she hugged me and Ked tightly.  I was exhausted by the time we got home after Life Group and it didn't take long to fall asleep! Today, it looks like the sun is shining. I feel like a swim!               "
22,Virgo,"       First, it was the ankle. My own stupidity for not resting what I knew was the worst sprain I'd ever experienced. All for the 'glory' of not losing to a half-way competitive team that had several players from my soccer team on it.  Next, the knee and wrist. Pretty sure these happened on the same incident when I ran face first full tilt into a metal fence chasing a softball while ineubriated in center field. I got a lasting wonderful trace scar below my eye and a right wrist and left knee that don't respond well to pressure or force anymore.  Now, it's the hip. Playing ultimate last night I did an unnormal dive. Normally when I dive and am not landing back to my feet it is 'with speed' so that it's a horizontal leap more than a vertical and I slide across the ground when I do. In this case I turned quick, made a few steps and them jumped...Caught the disc...and fell like a sack of potatoes. Felt no pain during the game (of course) but this morning saw a very small bruise on the hip. I expect this will grow in the coming days and hopefully just be a hip pointer that heals full well unlike the rest.  Damnit, I'm getting old and broken :( I'm sure a lot of it has to do with how I treat my body, but by the same token why can't I heal faster or permanently anymore. It really sucks. At this rate my body will have to be more than 60% artificial by the time I'm 35. As long as the rod and tackle are 100% all natural and function properly right??? :P         "
23,Virgo,"   Several weeks ago I went  urlLink 'round and 'round with Mark Horne in a chat forum  regarding the nature of justifying faith (notitia, assensu, and fiducia) and its relation (if any) to our personal obedience to the Law of God (i.e. the first commandment).  You can review our discussion and exchange of ideas.  And, much to my gladness, Mr. Horne  urlLink has written a short, concise paper on this very issue .  I'm glad that he has written and expounded upon his position; showing that he believes indeed we Christians are justified by and through our personal obedience to, and exercise of, the law of God.  I certainly do hope I was a strong motivation and catalyst for such a reaction that will hopefully expose his theology for what it is: Arminian at best and Romanist at worst. "

28,Sagittarius,"        More Ying & Yang  Reviewing my last entry, I realize that I only gave one ying & yang example.  I could give more, like how great it is that my youngest daughter is home after living with her grandmother for the past three months.  It's great having her back where she belongs, but it's not great waking up three times in the night - bottle break, potty break and day break.  She was up at 6:45 am saying 'Mommy, its a little bit morning, time to wake up!'    Gotta take the good with the bad, right?    And have another cup of coffee to get me through the day.           "
29,Cancer,"       and no, i'm not talking about the incessant rain. i actually like the rain; the seven-month manchester winter of grey and mizzle is part of the appeal. i guess i just like wearing coats, and to quote the  urlLink otters : the rain soothes the tempest that is my soul.  at my therapist's this morning we identify patterns that lead to my (quote) deviousness (unquote), and we learn exactly why it is that my mother (quote) pisses me off (unquote). i am sure that this is progress. on the way out, i pick up a leaflet for  urlLink calm , an organisation i fully support through my general apathy. the leaflet says 'suicide is the biggest killer amongst men aged from 15-35 years old. it accounts for 21% of all deaths among this age group in britain. this phenomenon, which started in the 1970s, is echoed across europe, the us and australia'. this is, i think you'll agree, quite startling. is does raise the question as to why men started killing themselves in the seventies? i blame fashion.  also, the telephone lines are open from 5pm to 3am, every day. these hours lead to two obvious conclusions: i) the miserable also need to sleep ii) men only become miserable after watching  newsround , which is understandable since the departure of the delectable  urlLink becky jago .   at eleven in the morning i am delighted to say i have already had four of the recommended five portions of fruit. they are: 1 bowl muesli (i avoided being pulled in by the strong currants) 2 satsumas 1 apple   i have been musing on happiness; i will return.  n.

30,Pisces,"             Focused (read: the boring process of burning cd's) at the moment  on the next aggression EP for THESE MILLION NIGHTS, which by the way, is my all time favorite aggression song. Ash's single mix so far is really hot. Lotta warmth to it. Remix kits are going out now. We've got the British , we've got the Russians, we have a few New Yorkers, and maybe even some midwesterner's remixing. And to top it off, we have a cover picture from Iceland. You can't get more international than that. Maybe it will come out this year. Maybe ;-)  F         "
31,Scorpio,"             Anyone see dead mummies this episode. I sure did, but of course since the producers were not licensed to kill they had to almost kill them by stripping them of all their cash in Egypt. I mean, when you’re not going to be going to the airport, and you’re in a poor country like this, how in the world are you going to get money other than being a night soil carrier?  So, the teams left the pit stop in Catherine’s Palace, and found that they had to take a train to St. Petersburg’s Hermitage museum. There they had to find Rembrandt’s “Return of the Prodigal Son”, something that sounds vaguely familiar. I kind of think I chanced upon it while doing my OM research, because Rembrandt is one of the registered artists in the problem. So anyway Chip & Kim took an extraordinarily long time to find the painting, while Colin & Christie started a leg of bickering by suggesting that the Prodigal Son was Jesus. I’m left wondering whether God neglected to give him any sense of general knowledge. In the meantime, Charla & Mirna, unlike all other teams who took cabs, “choo-chooed” their way to the train station on foot. A great display of Race skills was shown when she asked locals about the painting.         Once the teams found their painting, they found that they had to go to Cairo, Egypt, for this leg of the race. Chip & Kim stupidly rushed to the airport, while Colin & Christie, a pair that has proven to be apt at flight arrangements, walked to a travel agency. A travel agency is the place where they actually check all the airlines for the earliest flight. In airports, their access to flight information is limited, and most of the staff are too lazy to check thoroughly.  Kami & Karli were the only other team smart enough to go to a travel agency, but they were too late to catch Colin & Christie’s flight.  Colin & Christie came to the realization that they were on the earliest flight to Egypt, and the others had been duped by the Lufthansa lady. They had a stopover in Paris, for quite a number of hours, I presume, since they had time to find another flight. This flight, instead of 2.25pm, landed at 2.35 am, about 12 hours earlier than expected. They got to Egypt and the Tower of Cairo, but found it closed. The poor things had to sleep in the Egyptian streets. I mean, even the poor Egyptians don’t sleep on the streets, and they had to?!  All the other teams stopped over at Frankfurt, except Linda & Karen. They were found to be with the lying Lufthansa lady, who informed them it was possible to catch up in Frankfurt. She turned out not to be lying for a second time around, cause they really caught up. Meanwhile, in Frankfurt, cousins Charla & Mirna proved that they were too small to be noticed when they isolated themselves from the other teams to find better tickets out. It turns out that there was a better flight, and our little pink panthers, complete with the tiptoeing scene, left for the flight that landed 50 minutes earlier than the other. That scene, coupled with Lance stirring in his piggy-wiggy slumber, was one of the most hilarious scenes in TAR history.  In Cairo, Colin & Christie went up to the tower to find one of 2 “Fast Forwards” in the whole race. In a way it was a good option because there are only 2, and the likelihood of you using either would be pretty small. Might as well take a rest from 1 leg of the race. They had to carry this sarcophagus, one of those gold coffin thingys in the pyramids that you usually see in the movies, from somewhere to a temple. Colin was being a huge jerk by thinking he was so smart and not heeding Christie’s advice. In the end, Christie was right and they carried the thing to the temple. At the temple, Christie refused to shut her gap and wanted Colin to admit he was wrong. Bad move! I should know since my father’s a Colin (same name, same character…). When they reached the temple, Colin halted and started bickering. The priest started shaking his head in disapproval… Hey! These clue holders aren’t supposed to display emotion! Well anyway, I was hoping the priest tear up the clue in objection to their quarrelling in his temple, but he didn’t and sent Colin & Christie along to their pit stop, The Sphinx.         Colin & Christie arrived at the pit stop at 11.27am, and I have to fast forward 3 hours to when Charla & Mirna arrive. They go to the Tower of Cairo, and found that they had to go to the Giza plateau and follow the yellow rocks to their next clue. They went there, had a little trouble, and then finally got themselves to the Roadblock. From what I see, this was the most time consuming thing in this leg. It might have taken even longer than the Detour!         The Roadblock: one team member had to enter Osiris’ shaft and grab a artifact bag. Citing claustrophobia, Mirna asked Charla to go down. I’m left wondering what Mirna can do besides getting her team noticed at ticketing counters. Poor little Charla had to climb every single rung of the ladder because of her “littleness”, and after a while, with the bag as big as she was, she had to take little rests on the ladders. Those producers sure aren’t thinking too much about her still being in the race…         Anyway, Charla & Mirna were given a map as their next clue, coupled with the contents in the bag. Puzzling for a little while, they assembled the puzzle on the map and found the little hole that led them to their next location. They found the Detour as other teams started arriving at the Roadblock. Kami & Karli, however, were easily dumfounded by the puzzle. Not like they realize that the oval room in the white house doesn’t have corners…         The Detour this time involved Rock & Roll, and Hump & Ride. In Rock & roll, nice play on words to the producers, teams had to use an ancient method of transporting wooden blocks. Ball bearings in the form of logs were given beneath the stones and teams had to roll it, apparently across the length of a football field. It is, according to Phil, “physically demanding, but if you master the ancient art of rolling stones, it can be completed quickly.”         In Hump & Ride, which only Charla & Mirna arrived in time for, teams has to get on horses to guide camels with carpets on their bags to a carpet merchant. This task was entirely up to the moods of the horses, whether they went fast or not. I have a feeling with all those empathetic horse and camel rearers by Charla’s side, even helping her to get on the horse, they managed this task pretty fast.         And all the teams went to the pit stop, where the moms got last place. It isn’t a big surprise as there’s a Fast Forward. The producers wouldn’t want the Fast Forward to determine who gets eliminated, especially since they’re trying to downplay and eliminate the Fast Forwards. Anyway next week the mummies have to beg. Will they be wrapped up and sent into the tomb? I don’t think they would fit into one of those sarcophagus thingys!          "
32,Pisces,"                 .......................  The Psino  .......................    import from  urlLink the back burner   I was never sure why I was a psino (silent p); if it was something i had done; something i should be embarrassed about or something that was generally true of everyone.   it was certainly true of everyone that was in my sunday school classes.   Jesus loves me, the psino, for the bible tells me so.   Perhaps 'psino' was a theological term describing the comprehensiveness of original sin?   It was a ridiculously long time before I figured out my error.   this, I know.   and i thought of it this weekend when Jaelyn asked me and Lynn very insistently and repetitively:   'What is Cruisey - Violence?'   It took a lot of conversation to realize that this was her take on the crowds maelovelent chant in the JESUS film (which she's been watching) as they chant, 'crucify him!'

35,Gemini,"        So as I am feverishly writing e-mails and following up on work, I notice a man at the copy machine that is near my cubicle. He's a great and funny guy. Maybe about 65 years old, very smart... And I watch him pray to the copy machine. You know the stance: Standing with drooped shoulders, head down, staring at the machine as if it will speak to you with the truth of gods. Some people get mesmerized by this machine, and I found myself deep in tough about what it is that captures peoples attention and makes them so useless in front of mechanical devices. It's as if they are in awe of the machine, or is it frustration?   There are always a few types of people when it comes to these things... The reverent and helpless, the masters, the procrastinators, and the copy-raged. We've already talked about the reverent. The masters are the people who solve every problem and have this (falsely attributed) aura of magician around the office. I believe I fit into this category. The procrastinators are the ones who know how to use the copier, but never let anyone else know so they don't have to help anyone else out. They also sit at the copy machine trying to enlarge pictures of their face or making ridiculous amount of copies of something.... anything not to do actual work. Then there is the copy-rage people. They stand in front of the machine and offer up a scrappy irregularly sized piece of paper and expect it to run through the feeder. When the inevitable warning 'BEEP' of the copier rings out, you start to hear BEEPS come out of the users mouth. They curse up a storm and sometimes whack at the machine. Then they try to retrieve their paper from the workings of the inner rollers and recesses of the deep. Either way, the masters get called again to save the day. And since I sit right near the copier I get to help everyone.   At least I am treated like a magician.    "

37,Virgo,"       Free cudos to whoever can answer this useless trivia question. There's a movie which I don't think starred the child co-star to that 80's TV show which had Alan Thicke, Kirk Cameron, brother of Candice Cameron who was on Full House with Dave Coulier who supposedly had a song written about him by Alanis Morisette. So yeah, in this movie with the character maybe played by Kirk, he's a hockey coach of a junior hockey team and the child star wants to play even though he's hurt and the coach won't let him play if he can't hold a stick at the middle and turn his wrist all the way in each direction.  The only reason I want to know is because right now my right wrist is sore from the softball on the weekend that I can't do that. Every time I stretch Mr. pinky across to the enter key on my keyboard I die a little more.  The 'rents and fam are coming to see the house tomorrow night and have a BBQ.

41,Virgo,"             &nbsp; I'm not happy tonight.&nbsp; I'm not sure why, I just feel miserable and irritable and fed up with everything.&nbsp; It's like I can't see where I'm going anymore, and I don't know where I'm supposed to be or what I'm supposed to be doing or anything.&nbsp; I want to hide for a while and forget about the world, but tha's not an option, I've done that before, and it just makes me worse.&nbsp; A few years ago I made myself almost agoraphobic with depression, I didn't want to leave the house, and when I did I had panic attacks and could barely walk to the shops down the road without flinching when someone walked past me.&nbsp; It got to the point where I had to put my foot down and force myself to go out of the front door, to walk to the bus stop, to get on the bus.&nbsp; I only managed it by listening to my discman on full blast.&nbsp; It was like walking around in a&nbsp;little coccoon of, well, Linkin Park and Nickelback of all things, surrounded by the music I felt safe, and gradually I started to pull myself out of it.&nbsp; I was still miserable, but at least I could go out&nbsp;of the front door without having a panic attack. &nbsp; That's all in the&nbsp;past now though, and I'm no where near as bad at the moment as I was then.&nbsp; I do have a tendency to shut&nbsp;myself away and try to block out the world though.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I know how bad I can get, I won't let myself&nbsp;get that bad again.&nbsp; There are worse things than agoraphobia, and I've&nbsp;done some of them, sometimes, when I've hated myself in the past.&nbsp; I promised myself that I wouldn't do it again, but the thing about promises like that are that when you promise, you're not in the same frame of mind as you are when you're doing it.&nbsp; I just realised that I haven't said what 'it' is.&nbsp;&nbsp;'It' is self harm.&nbsp; Not to a huge extent, but it's still not healthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I get to that stage,&nbsp;it's like there's two of me, Sane Kate and Crazy Kate (and even sane Kate isn't that sane, but crazy Kate is terrifying- She scares me anyway).&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't been that bad for a while now.&nbsp; Even when I was down the last time, I wasn't that bad, and the herbal happy pills seem to be working ok.&nbsp; I didn't intend to write about this tonight, but&nbsp;my fingers seem to have developed a mind of their own.&nbsp; I'm in two minds whether to even&nbsp;post this or not.&nbsp; It seems a little self indulgent, and attention seeking.&nbsp; It's not intended to be.

49,Aquarius,"       A rental for a week for your family, but a house to someone else.  The evidence of the family who owns the house is all around.  The selection of beach reads on the bookcase in the hall, a small sampling of games with missing pieces in the living room, pictures of the grandpa who worked his whole life to buy the house, artwork from local artists, and the choice of curtains that don’t match the furniture.  You enter a rental house like you enter a hotel.  You know it is not yours yet you will treat it is such for the next week all the while ever thinking about the family who calls it “our beach house.”    There have been houses that don’t lock things away.  The fishing pole of the grandpa who bought the house when he retired hangs on the wall beckoning you to use it.  So, you’re father does and on the first cast into the ocean he breaks it.  It’s too bad the original grandfather is dead or your father would have apologized to him.  Your whole family is a bit embarrassed, but your mother’s friend who rented the house said we were free to use the poles so your guilt is lessened a bit.  Still, too bad about ole granddad.  There are the houses that seem to want to share the experience with you.  They leave out a guest book and brochures about the area.  You glance at them.  There have been visitors from as far away as Ohio or as close by as New Bern.  Your brother calls the travelers from New Jersey and New York Yankees.  You call them Yankees too, but not out loud.  They tell stories of their weeks, how much their family loved the house, the good weather they were fortunate to have, and they note their favorite restaurants.  You wonder why they choose to write what they write.  The guest book is quaint, but you are happiest about the tide chart on the bulletin board, now you can start your vacation.    Exploring the house, you can’t believe that people share their space so openly with others that they will never meet.  The coffeepot and spoons and beds and pillows and sinks and bathtubs and deck chairs and lamps are all communal property.  There are fragile things about and when your niece knocks over a lamp and it shatters feel sorry for the family again, but then you think that the owner’s expect these things; beach houses are for children too.  You wonder how all the house was stocked.  Did the owner’s really like the dark, dense fabric on the overstuffed couches or was the whole ensemble on sale?  Did they pick up the appliances at a thrift store or are the leftovers from the family 1970s orange kitchen?  Your family discusses the flaws in the house, in the decorations.  They have ideas on how to make it better, what to paint or how to arrange the furniture.  You are quick to remind them that it is better than any of their beach houses.  Oh yeah, they don’t have beach houses.  No one is amused.    Some houses have a washer and dryer and this is a luxury.  You do a million loads in one week, more than if you were at home and partly just because you can.  You go home with clean clothes; this you realize is quite nice.  Other houses have a linen service and beds are made for you and towels are provided.  You feel a bit pampered by this, but you’d rather have the washer and dryer back.      There are houses with air conditioning so strong you end up with a stuffy nose going from hot to cold to hot to cold.  There are houses where your family breaks the AC and has to have the unit replaced midweek.  You are again a bit embarrassed, but realize you are just helping with the maintenance of the place.  Then there are houses with no air conditioning at all, just ceiling fans and the hope of good ocean breezes.  These are your favorites.  These remind you of camping in childhood.  This is what the beach feels like to you, heat cut by cool breezes off the water.  Days when there is no breeze you thank God for the invention of ceiling fans.  It takes a good day to get use to the heat and the breeze, but when you do, you don’t ever want air conditioning at the beach again.  You sleep in little clothing and one sheet, you like the simplicity of this type of house.    In your mind you are always building the perfect beach house.  It is oceanfront with enough bedrooms to house you immediate and extended family.  It is not new, it is old and well worn, and there is a lot of wood.  The oceanfront deck is partly covered and partly open to the elements.  There are rocking chairs and a hammock.  There is a table for eating and playing cards.  A walk stretches to the dune where just before the stairs begin there is another small deck with seats built in and a shower hose for rinsing off.  The house has most of its bedrooms on the first floor.  Upstairs, at ocean view and deck level, there is a family room and kitchen and dining room in one space.  There are many large windows.  The dining room table is big enough to sit 12 and there are folding tables for extra company.  You want your whole family here and you create a space that allows for it.  Couches in the living room turn into beds.  There is a good stereo with speakers throughout the house and the deck.  Oldies beach music is always on.  Every bedroom has a well-made ceiling fan and can be closed off to the rest of the house so that windows can be opened at night.  There are beach chairs on the deck and in the garage, waiting for the sand.  They are wooden with cloth backs.  There are rafts and lifejackets and paddleball sets and kites and bachi ball.  The house is always full of people.         "
50,Capricorn,"                    It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are a lot of things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now.    You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met and that people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you do not realize is that they are realizing that too and are not really cold or catty or mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you.    You look at your job. It is not even close to what you thought you would be doing or maybe you are looking for one and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and are scared.    You miss the comforts of college, of groups, of socializing with the same people on a constant basis. But then you realize that maybe they weren't so great after all.    You are beginning to understand yourself and what you want and do not want. Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging a bit more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and add things to your list of what is acceptable and what is not.    You are insecure and then secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused.    Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward.    You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you or you lay in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough to get to know better. You love someone but maybe love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you are not a bad person.    One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap and getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic. You go through the same emotions and questions over and over and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision.    You worry about loans and money and the furture and making a life for yourself and while winning the race would be great, but right now you'd just like to be a contender! What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it. We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out.        "

59,Pisces,"             I am going to be in some deep shit with this...  Jackie Chan in talks with government to construct a Jackie Chan village in Hong Kong over the next ten years  by Wu Chi Ming 2003.11.17  Jackie Chan took interviews with a few Japanese newspapers the other day, and revealed plans to cooperate with the Hong Kong government to construct a village (the Jackie village!) in ten years time.  The village could have a Jackie Chan museum and a movie themed park.  Jackie Chan's 'Shanghai Knights' opened the day before yesterday in Japan.  But because he was hard at work on 'New Police Story, Jackie was unable to promote the movie in person.  But he still attracted a large number of Japanese media who arrived in Hong Kong to interview him.  He accepted interviews from 'Sports Daily' and 'Sankei Sports' and disclosed his planned construction of the Jackie village in Hong Kong.  Each part of the facility [would be world class.]  Jackie Chan said, '...I plan a Jackie village!  Besides having a movie themed park, we could have a theater, a [sports area?] and a Jackie museum.  Jackie had originally had this idea on his mind for several years.  He said, 'Although Jackie Village is still in the planning stage, there has already been four or five meetings with the Hong Kong government.  The final plan isn't in cement yet, and I can't disclose details.  It was a secret!  There are still a lot of plans for the project.  Moreover, from the beginning until now it's been about two or three years.  I believe in order to complete the project it would take ten years!'  A few years ago there were rumors of plans to construct a Jackie Chan museum in Yokohama, but the plan was stopped.  Now Jackie has regained hope.  http://www.the-sun.com.hk/channels/ent/20031117/img/c21117_big.jpg         "

Here are the lyrics.  'Pre-Ex-Girlfriend'  She's so cool it's almost eerie she's so fine I lost all hope Genetical testing something has gone wrong she should get back in her cage before they find she's gone She said she hated Kenny G that girl is way too good for me We'll break up before it starts She'll only tear my world apart da na na na na na na na  [Chorus:] Pre-ex-girlfriend, that girl is just too fine Pre-ex-girlfriend, leaving me behind  You might say she's everything just before everything goes wrong She's sunshine and lightning she pulls at my heartstrings she's stunning and then she's gone The intellect that girl has She's saying 'death to false jazz' Like kryptonite to Superman she's here to break my heart again da na na na na na na na  Watch her on the floor tonight feel the crush she will incite the spark of hope she will ignite a beautiful sight Softer than the lightest snows watch her as the moment slows in my face the door will close and there she goes.   [Spoken:] Guy: Uh-um Hi... Girl: Hi Guy: I uh, I was across the room and I looked over, and I saw you... and um... Girl: yea? Guy: I was wondering if... Girl: Uh-huh Guy: Maybe you wanted to... uh... go do something? Girl: Umm.. No.   You see what I mean? If you don't, you probably haven't read my first post.

67,Gemini,"       Yesterday I went crazy getting completely registered for the first semester of English IV at BC, and afterwards Sara went crazy changing to the English class that I was signed up for, so now we both have it from 9:40 to 11:09 every morning until early August. About ten minutes ago Chess said, 'Happy summer. Enjoying no college?' I ran into my room and slammed the door.  The class was very easy today. . . . And since I don't know where my mom is or what she wants me to be doing right now, I'm going to post about it, elaborately. The teacher was completely new, and called it 'Brazoria College' on accident, and then corrected herself. The teacher seems pretty nice, but at the same time relatively incompetent. Kind of like Mrs. Munson. Except Mrs. Munson wasn't very nice.   I think that people in general are pretty fascinatingly terrible so here are some interesting and excessively detailed descriptions of the people in our class: There's a woman in our class who's probably around 30 who told the teacher a lot of terrible stuff, since we spent the whole class period talking casually. First the woman went outside for a smoke break. Then she said, 'You do NOT want to see me when I haven't been smoking.' And she told us about how she had been smoking since she was 14, she spent her senior year in alternative, she knows where there are whorehouses in town, she did drugs and alcohol but found them less addictive than cigarettes, and then comes the most illegal part--they started talking about police, and the woman said, 'how do you think I got off my probation early? You pay off who you gotta pay off.' Everyone in the class was pretty disturbed and/or alarmed by her saying that, and she said it in a very matter-of-fact way, like someone would say, 'my pickup was making fun noises this morning, and then I found out the fanbelt was loose.'  The kid who sat in front of us was a senior at B'port, and he said that he was going to be a pre-med student, and then he cussed a few times, talked to no one, laid his head down like a kindergartener, and walked out twenty minutes early.  There was a girl who had made a face when she was three years old, ignored her mother's warnings, and got her face stuck that way. She was looking around the room while people were talking, and for the entire class period, her face seemed to say, 'why isn't anyone licking my shoes?'  The guy who sat next to Sara was really goofy. He said he was home-schooled. He had his shirt tucked in, he was unshaven, and he had pretty big glasses. He was passing around the role sheet, and he slid it into Sara's water, which fell over, and he laughed in a really goofy way.  Well, I'm done talking about those people, and I'm pretty sure that was enough to keep anyone from ever looking at this blog again. So there you go.  Sara's at work right now, and I want to help my mom (who is home now) but she's on the phone, and has been for about ten minutes.  Who thinks that Sara's blog and my blog should get married? Any opinions? You wouldn't have to read about the same day more than once. Ehh? Ehh? Okay, I give up. I'm going to find something else to do.    "
68,Leo,"       I have just returned from swim team practice. I feel like a pansy. Then again, the other people (6 other girls varying age, the youngest of which is around 12 and the oldest must be around 16) have been for a few years probably. Or at least many months. We swam for one hour straight. Sprinting. Ah, very fun; I could barely keep up in the first sprints. In the warm-up we swam an easy 5 minute freestyle..I did better in that. Heh, that's pretty sad saying that I did better in the warm-up. Immediatly following this, we did more sprints, sets of 50 yards. I did alright. I was in the first group to go, and the last to come back predictably enough. Suffice to say, this happened about everytime. I did in fact, eat every one elses bubbles. ;-) I have not yet perfected my flip-turn, so I was slow in turning, I haven't perfected any of my strokes, thus increasing my water resistance and decreasing my speed, and increasing my chances of getting tired faster. Anyone with any tips? I think I just need practice. This is only my fourth day to swim, so I'm doing alright. Now that I'm home, I need to mow in about an hour or two...the smell of freshly cut grass. In the meantime, however, I can eat and take a nap or something. Out for now.          "

71,Scorpio,"       So I've been reading Margaret Atwood again...  It's almost like listening to Konstantine.   Anyway, I've got to keep these quotes somewhere...  otherwise I'll forget them. 'I'm stuck on that wretched term paper.  Once I went to the zoo and there was a cage with a frenzied armadillo in it going around in figure-eights, just around and around the same path.  I can still remember the funny metallic sound its feet made on the bottom of the cage.   They say all caged animals get that way when they're caged, it's a form of psychosis, and even if you set the animals free after they go like that they'll just run around in the same pattern.  You read and read the material and after you've read the twentieth article you can't make any sense out of it any more, and then you start thinking about the number of books that are published in any given year in any given moth, and in any given week and that's just too much. Words,' he said, looking in my direction finally, but with his eyes strangely unfoucused, as though he was really looking at a poin several inches beneath my skin, 'are beginning to lose their meanings.'                                                        -The Edible Woman  And this is the one I'm reading now, this is how it starts: 'I don't know how I should live.  I don't know how anyone should live.  All I know is how I do live.  I live like a  peeled snail.  And that's no way to make money. I want that shell back, it took me long enought to make.  You've got it with you, wherever you are.  You were good at removing.  I want a shell like a sequined dress, made of silver nickels and dimes and dollars overlappin like the scales of an armadillo.  Armored dildo.  Impermeable; like a French raincoat. I wish I didn't have to think about you.  You wanted to impress me; well I'm not impressed, I'm disgusted.  That was a disgusting thing to do, childish and stupid.  A tantrum, smashing a doll, but what you smashed was your own head, your own  body.  You wanted to make damn good and sure I'd never be able to turn over in bed again with out feeling that body beside me, not there, but tangible, like a leg that's been cut off.  Gone but the place still hurts.  You wanted me to cry, mourn, sit in a rocker with a black-edged handkerchief, bleeding from the eyes.  But I'm not crying, I'm angry.   I'm so angry I could kill you.  If you hadn't already done that for yourself.'                                                                      -Life before Man.  I wish I could write like Margaret Atwood.  I love reading her books.  They are examples of books that are not junk. ... that I can actually lose my self in.   I can be depressed because of the book, instead of being depressed because of my life.  That's a good thing.  Samantha was talking about how 'fiberous' I am.  She said everything I do has something to do with paper.  I love paper, I love the way it feels.  Its very personal.  That's why I write letters to people so much.  I don't know anyone else who does that.  I just sit there and think...  I should write to so and so... and so I do.  They mean more effort than just calling somebody up, you have to spend 37 cents for a stamp and actually put it in the mail.  Taking the effort means its important to you.  I wish people would realize that.      I really have been sick of myself lately.    I wonder what's the matter with me.   Well, I know what's the matter with me... But I should have figured that out by now... It's the same old....'I'll be fine.'  'I'll be fine.'  I keep telling myself that... Maybe eventually I'll believe it,  maybe eventually I will be fine...  Maybe I'll be better than fine.  Maybe I'll be happy.   Those words echo over and over again in my head...  Maybe... eventually... Someday...    and I think, 'ugh.'     "
72,Taurus,"       Here is an extract of a message sent to me, thought you might  find it interesting...   There were 39 combat related killings in Iraq during the month of  January.. In the fair city of Detroit there were 35 murders in the month of  January... thats just one American city, about as deadly as the entire  war torn country of  Iraq.   When some claim President Bush shouldn't have started this war, state the following; FDR, led us into World War II.  450,000 lives were lost an average of 112,500 per year. Truman, finished that war and started one in Korea, North Korea never attacked us. From 1950-1953, 55,000 lives were lost an average of 18,334 per year.   John F. Kennedy, started the Vietnam conflict in 1962. Vietnam never attacked us.  Johnson, turned Vietnam into a quagmire. From 1965-1975,  58,000 lives were lost an average of 5,800 per year.  Clinton, went to war in Bosnia without UN or French consent,  He was offered Osama bin Laden's head on a platter three times by Sudan and did nothing. Osama has attacked us on multiple occasions.  In the two years since terrorists attacked us President Bush has, liberated two countries, crushed the Taliban, crippled al-Qaida, put nuclear inspectors in Libya, Iran and North Korea without firing a shot, and captured a terrorist who slaughtered 300,000 of his own people.  The Democrats are complaining about how long the war is taking, but, It took less time to take Iraq than it took Janet Reno to take the Branch  Davidian compound. That was a 51 day operation. We've been looking for evidence of chemical weapons in Iraq for less time than it took Hillary Clinton to find the Rose Law Firm billing records.  It took less time for the 3rd Infantry Division and the Marines to destroy the Medina Republican Guard than it took Ted Kennedy to call the police after his Oldsmobile sank at Chappaquiddick.  It took less time to take Iraq than it took to count the votes in Florida!!!!  Wait, there's more..........JOHN GLENN ON THE SENATE FLOOR.  Some people still don't understand why military personnel do what they do for a living. This exchange between Senators John Glenn and Senator Howard Metzenbaum is worth reading. Not only is it a pretty impressive impromptu speech, but it's also a good example of one man's explanation of why men and women in the armed services do what they do for a living. This IS a typical, though sad, example of what some who have never served think of the military. Senator Metzenbaum to Senator Glenn: 'How can you run for Senate when you've never held a real job?' Senator Glenn: 'I served 23 years in the United States Marine Corps. I served through two wars. I flew 149 missions. My plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire on 12 different occasions. I was in the space program. It wasn't my checkbook, Howard; it was my life on the line. It was not a nine-to-five job, where I took time off to take the daily cash receipts to the bank. I ask you to go with me ... as I went the other day to a veteran's hospital and look those men - with their mangled bodies -in the eye, and tell THEM they didn't hold a job! You go with me to the Space Program at NASA and go, as I have gone, to the widows and orphans of Ed White, Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee... and you look those kids in the eye and tell them that their DADS didn't hold a job. You go with me on Memorial Day and you stand in Arlington National Cemetery, where I have more friends buried than I'd like to remember, and you watch those waving flags. You stand there, and you think about this nation, and you tell ME that those people didn't have a job? I'll tell you,  Howard Metzenbaum; you should be on your knees every day of your life thanking God that there were some men - SOME MEN - who held REAL jobs. And they required a dedication to a purpose - and a love of country and a dedication to duty - that was more important than life itself. Andtheir self-sacrifice is what made this country possible. I HAVE held a job, Howard!  What about you? 'For those who don't remember - During W.W.II,  Howard Metzenbaum was an attorney representing the Communist Party in the USA. Now he is a Senator!  If you can read this, thank a teacher. If you are reading it in English thank a Veteran !!     "
73,Capricorn,"                 I was flipping through a book called  The Great Pianists from Mozart to the Present , by Harold C. Schonberg (1963). I was reading about Chopin's hands. That may sound odd, but to one who plays the piano it can be an interesting subject. Let me quote:  'What an artist he must have been! Heller spoke of Chopin's slim hands--how they would 'suddenly expand and cover a third of the keyboard. It was like the opening of the mouth of a serpent about to swallow a rabbit whole'...'  I love that quote of Heller's. That was a great comparison with the serpent. I was reading about that period of time: the Romantic period in the history of music. It always makes me so envious! All those wonderful composers living at the same time, creating music that will never die, and always be delightful. Chopin is, of course, my favorite. I'm working on his Waltz in A Minor (Posthumous), and Prelude in E Minor (Op.28, No.4). Playing them is so wonderful, but whenever I read about their composer I feel how inadeuqately I express their genius. Once I sat for over an hour doing absolutely nothing but listen to a Chopin CD, and the time went by very quickly. I think I've got to the point in this post where I'm rambling, and if you want to understand me now you'll just have to listen to Chopin's music yourself.      "

I am on my way, shortly, to pay the first installment of this years tuition for my children. It's crazy. I will be paying damn near as much for tutition a month as I do for rent. And I don't really care for this school. So, that, in itself, makes the experience extremely painful. But, for right now it's convenient. Just a couple of blocks north.  I shall have to endure the pain for at least one more year, then we can check into St. Daniel's.  Which is the grammar school Nick attended.   And I really like that, but they did not have a full-time preschool.  St. Rene does.  Answers the question of what I am suppose to do with the kids while in school and at clinicals.

I think she really, really wants me to suceed and I appreciate all that she has done to allow me the opportunity.  Okie, off to the school.  WISH ME LUCK.

84,Libra,                
85,Libra,"           Some news that I only found out about since arriving.  My new hometown of Lae actually sits astride of one the most seismically active faults in the world.  It floats on the edge of the great Indo-Australian plate, which is steadily marching northward and the comparatively tiny Bismarck plate (more of a saucer).  This in turn is sandwiched up against the massive Pacific plate which is slowly heading east.  You do the maths!  At some point no doubt I am going to feel a bit of a shiver as the two big fellas, work out their differences and play piggy in the middle.  So far so good, with not much activity, and apparently there hasn't b  een much  for decades.  Lets hope though that when the bigfella's are dancing the tango, they don't end up shaking their booty.   You learn to live with some unexpected occurrences up here, but even so it is hard not to feel sorry at the moment for 200,000 people that live to the south, across the main river in the area, the Markham.  Three weeks ago the only bridge over the Markham, linking the communities of Bulolo and Wau to the rest of the country, was closed to all traffic, and only foot traffic was allowed.  One of the piers, due a big rise in water level, started to float, and so that section now has a noticeable sag. People got on though and hand carted goods over the bridge between unloading trucks and the waiting ones on the other side.  That was until a week ago, when the water, which is still quite high, washed away the abutment on the Lae side, leaving a 5m gap betwe  en the  bridge and the bank.  So in effect that has now severed all cargo access to 200,000 in southern Morobe.  And this will probably remain so, until the experts stop scratching their heads, and work out how to build a new bridge, which is not as simple as it sounds as the Markham valley is basically all gravel without any bedrock, for a long way down.  It is not just civil infrastructure that suffers either.  All of last week a major microwave link that Telikom owns failed between here and the capital Port Moresby, which completely halted the mobile network and data lines for this part of the country.  That meant the Uni's Internet connection was offline for all of last week.  Transport is not exactly something that runs to a timetable or is diverse in it's options.  Public Motor Vehicles (PMV’s) are the only way to get around all the cities and towns apart from Port Moresby, which is lucky enough to have Taxis.   PMV's are an experience just in themselves with most of them second-hand Japanese mini-buses with 25 seats that have not been maintained for god knows how long.  I must have by now been on the full range of quality available, from the newer ones, that still have the stuffing in the seats to the, lets just say barely held together ones, where stuffing in the seats is considered a luxury and air-conditioning comes not only from the glassless window but through holes in the floor.  One  that I went on yesterday, seemed to give discounts if you helped push-start when the engine stalls.  With almost daily reports in the newspapers, of another PMV crash, X number dead, it is better to grab a lift with someone you know who's going to town.  Though the good thing is that because there is no timetable to worry about, you just rock up to a bus stop, and jump on a waiting bus.  When it fills up, which doesn’t take long, off it goes.  This only really works though in non peak times.  If you try on a Saturday morning there will be a massive crush to get on any PMV that shows up.  This is mainly due to the PMV operators looking for the easy money and not doing the longer routes, like out to the uni, so you have the compounding problem of more people wanting to use the buses and less of them available. The other issue, that I discovered first hand on Sunday, is like a lot of other places in the world  when you get the crowds you get the pickpockters.  Though maybe it is my now ingrained wariness in those situations, or perhaps that the kid was an amateur, but I easily caught him trying to dip his sticky little fingers into my empty pocket.  I have seen the art performed enough to know the modus operandi and therefore the respective counter-measures.  Well apart from all that gloom, the best thing this country offers, has to be the food.  Being a tropical country, food is literally everywhere, and it does not take too much to grow anything.  I thought of myself as a gangrene thumb, but as I discovered anyone can grow things here.  For example I have thrown herb and spice seeds out the back and without any help, they are now shooting up.  At the markets it is a veritable cornucopia, which the produce ranging from the ubiquitous Kau Kau (Sweet Potato - I didn't realise there were so many varieties) and Bananas (again many varieties  - don't get your cooking vs ripe mixed up) through to the tropical fruits, Paw Paw, Guava, Mango,  Pineapple, and then onto the more normal western veggies, like Carrot, Beans and Onions. If you are concerned by Genetically Modified crops and only buy Organic, well you don't have to worry here as they have not even heard of the term GM.  Everything is way it was intended.   And with my liklik (little) market being only a 5 minute walk, there is no excuse not to eat healthily.  Don’t get confused by the term Market, and think of check-out chicks and shopping trolleys.  Over here it is slightly different.  It is more of a take your own bag, wander around a bit looking for the best stuff, ask 'hamas' to get a price for that nice looking pineapple, fill up your bag making sure not to step on the sellers mat and then wander around for a bit further passing an eye over all the produce, type of market.  You may also chat to someone who knows your name and you may have met once before but have forgotten, buy some roasted peanuts as a snack and then head home saying “apinun!” (evening) to the giggling kids on the way.  It is a lot of fun and can turn into a small social event (see attached pic for an idea of what part of it looks  like).  Apart from that the best part for me at least, has to be the community life that I now have, living on the campus.  I know all my neighbours, and will always bump into someone that I know if I go for a walk.  Also being someone who is different and without an established family network, I have the benefit that everyone wants to help me out, so that means that I have got offers to stay in almost all parts of the country and visit a brother or sister of so-and-so or if they are going that way, I should go along so they can show me that part of the country.  Because aside from all of the problems it does have it really is a fairly spectactular country, with everything from massive mountains to crystal clear beaches (palm trees overhanging - think of those travel brochers you have seen) and from smoking volcano's to mighty rivers.  OK, I thought I would give some tips in case one day you head off to the airport, jump on a plane, it gets hi-jacked and you land in a foreign city but am not sure where.  If you see some or all of the following things from the window, you just may be in Papau New Guinea.    The security guards are using a bow and arrows, instead of a gun.  About ten guys with push lawnmowers are tackling the grass between the runways.  A DC10 is burnt out, sitting beside a hanger with most of its parts stripped.  The locals are more interested in trying to sell you something than save you.  The hostage negotiation team doesn’t show for two days, as they were on strike.  The sign above the terminal building says PORT MORESBY INTERNATIONAL AIR ORT.             "
86,Virgo,"           By Nick Groenke Washington Post Domestic Service Tuesday, June 15, 2004; 7:45 PM   Contrary to popular belief and a Leann Chin fortune cookie, 8 year old Alexa Groenke is not welcome in most gatherings.  After consuming an entree size plate of lemon chiked at Leann Chin's today, Alexa openned her fortune cookie, and was pleased to see that her fortune was 'You are welcome at any gathering.'  The cookie's claims were later disproven on the car ride home, when Alexa was told she was not welcome to come with her brother and his friends to Rigedale mall this Friday.

I SWEAR I WAS LITERALLY HAVING A HEART ATTACK! I WAS SO SCARED. seee, what happened was that i was online till around 11:45pm, and then got told to go to sleep, so, i went upstairs, and laid on my bed and closed my eyes, and almost fell asleep, but i had a little light on in my room..and i heard someone coming in my room, and i thought it was my mom, so i quickly shut the light off, but it turned out, it was my brother...  'yo Joanna, your 'friend' is online'  'whaaaaaaaaaaat? right now?!'  'yeah, you wanna talk to him?'  this is the moment, jO jumps outta bed, out of her room, and runs downstairs to the basement where her brother sleeps. (good thing my dad was already in bed, and my mom was like brushing her teeth or something int he bathroom, they didn' thear me go downstairs) so i get down there (my brother has his own laptop) and started talking to Chris....then we came up with a plan you seee..to stay up all night together talking on msn...the latest we ever stayed up on there was 4am. so what i had to do was hide in my brother's room UNDER HIS DESK, in the dark, so if my mom came into his room, she wouldn't see me. cuz they already think i'm in my room sleeping.  we spent the whole night talking...not closing our eyes, cuz we shut them...they won't open again!! lol. and our hearts would beat so fast, cuz we're so scared for ourselves and each other. if we got caught...we're done for. =S so we spent the whole night talking, and i went back upstairs, at 8am, to my bed..very quietly so no one could hear me..and fell into my bed...and slept..for a total of about 4 hours..i'm going back to bed soon i assure you. hehe. it was SO worth it. nearing the middle of the night i was like talking drunkness...but by the time sunrise hit,...i was so hyper..    'i've never seen this side of you before.' -chris  'you've beenwith me 15months, and you've never seen this side of me?! it's gotta be the tiredness, lol'-jO    seee chris, i've told you before...life's all about risks...!! if you ain't going to take risks...don't expect anything to happen. we practically risked our lives. !! lol, the way our parents are..yeah.i would say so. huh, funnie thing actually..we kinda got to know each other even better...despite the 15months...we even got to know how we are without sleep, at 4-8 am..in the morning. haha. i'm going to remember this memory for sure,       'my g/f is giving me girl tips'  NEVER ASK A GIRL HER SIZE  you're buying me CLOTHES!? LOL.  making dreams together then making them come true  PATTERNS!!  past g/f's and b/f's  completely ObLiVIOus  innie/inbetweenies  where's the whipped cream!?   that's all i can remember right now with the lack of sleep..some reason..it all felt like a dream..like it didn't even happen..like the times when you came over..they still feel like dreams too..  i was saving the convo, since i was on my brother's laptop, and put it on word..but at the last couple of minutes..i closed the window b4 i saved..cuz i was too concentrated in planning to how i'm going to get upstairs, and listening for my dad walking around....sorry chris=( oh well. we were talking randomness anyways. lol, the BEST randomness. key thing: at least we didn' tget caught...     'i&nbsp;leave when my dad opens the basement door to come down and go to the bathroom...he opens the door to freedom for me! LOL.'    *i need sleep*  &nbsp; urlLink       "
90,Cancer,"        urlLink The Time Traveler's Wife  was an incredibly thick book, yet the story was so compelling that I read it in one day.  It moved so smoothly, and the concept and characters were so interesting that I could not put it down.  Henry is a Chrono-Displaced Person (CDP), who travels through time involuntarily, usually when very stressed.  Clare first meets him when she is six and he is 36.  He returns regularly throughout her childhood from different times in their shared future. At last, when Clare is twenty and Henry twenty-eight, they meet in his present, and the relationship begins in earnest.   His constant disappearing and reappearing is hard on both of them, yet they are destined to be together and they persevere.            "

95,Aries,"                 People are always saying, “Just be yourself”. When you say, “I don’t know how to act in this situation”, they always say, “Just be yourself”. But what if “yourself”, I mean the way you truly are when no one is watching, it not what they wanted or expected. You are constantly rejected for “yourself”. How would anybody attain friends or a significant other?  Certainly not by being you. So according to the surrounding people, be it at home, at church, with your friends, you put on an act to satisfy their wants in a person. Like a chameleon, you change your colors, attitudes, style, personality, completely change yourself to match and blend in to your surroundings. So when people say, “Just be yourself,” think about it. They are really saying “Look, act, be… how I want you to be.”                "

I don't want to be in the middle...that where I deffinitly don't need to be, but I don't want to be completely on the sidelines.  That's what I need to do.

97,Pisces,"             I almost forgot to mention...  In non-hypefactor news, a recent Guardian newspaper interview with Scotch charmer Kelly MacDonald included some wonderful news for fans of British drama (such as myself). The BBC ordered a second season of  State Of Play , a six-part series about investigative reporters and political corruption in modern-day London that debuted in the States last month. While substantially shorter than MOG favorite  24  - it is customary for a British TV season to run a mere eight or nine episodes - the two shows share a great deal in terms of pacing (relentless action, frantic dialog, radical camera cuts, heart palpatations.) In the first season, the i-team tied a government researcher's murder and a drug shooting to an energy scandal in the British parliament, with plenty of unexpected twists. Admittedly no arms were severed in the making of the series, but this program can effortlessly hold a candle to  24  or any other mystery-action show.  Need more convincing? The original cast, most of whom are tipped to return, includes MacDonald, John Simm (Bernard Sumner in  24-Hour Party People , a raver in  Human Traffic ) and Bill Nighy (the aging rock star in  Love Actually ), among countless others. And MacDonald, despite being married to a twit who plays bass in Travis, is worth the price of admission alone. Sadly, the BBC is rubbish when it comes to issuing DVDs in a timely fashion, and the first season of  State Of Play  is no exception: The Beeb's Web site lists a release date in February 2005. I hope, however, that BBC America will run the series a few more times in the interim for those who missed MacDonald's gorgeous accent. And the other stuff, of course.         "

That they would find such news startling, yes, perhaps, but also heartening.    We must all needs become more substantial at some time or another, musn't we?   We shan't be able to truly make any impact anywhere if we're light enough for a breeze to blow us away.    Speed is one thing.  That is true.  Speed is a virtue that should not be poo-poo-ed by anyone. But ultimately? Really?  It can't be a core virtue.  Can it?  Nor can  change  for that matter.  Right?  Nor  innovation ?  and of course not  revolution ... They're all dependent upon the status quo.  Status quo is the thing.  And what is status quo if its not GIRTH?  If its not substance?  if its not presence?    He looked at himself in the mirror from the side.  Gravitas.  Significance.

107,Libra,"             On Monday, just as I was about to leave for school, four lovely little packages arrived from Play.com, and much to my delight, they were the cds I had ordered the Thursday before. First package ripped to shreds that I remember had to be  urlLink The Flaming Lips'  album 'Hear It Is'. This was followed by my cries of glee as I opened my second package,  urlLink Boards Of Canada's  great album 'Geogaddi'. Having looked at their website just now I recommend you take a visit, very nice Flash stuff in there.  Third package turned out to be  urlLink The Zuton's  'Who Killed The Zutons?'. which had to be my most awaited album of all four. And to top it off, Keane's (whose web address escapes my mind right now) 'Hopes And Fears'.  Still waiting for my U2 album to arrive, and even now, at time of posting this, has not arrived.  The Zutons totally blow away all the opposition in this album, having plenty of tracks that I already know the lyics to, and have shown to others. Next comes Boards Of Canada, which people I give a taster of, they do not like, which then I guess confirms that they are lunatics (oh yes, loonies).  Keane do have a good album, its fairly consistent and has some amazing tracks, and the first bar in 'Somewhere Only We Know' is powerful and gears you up straight from the very start.  The Flaming Lips' 'Hear It Is' is definitely not their best album, but still has great tracks. 'With You' is a song so lyrically simple and built up well with a crescendo that its hard to hate, its the Lips as they are, even if this was released in 1986. 'Unplugged' is a prime example of their punk sound, but most I could pick out during the first listen was the expletive 'shit', as what seemed to me, quite random. The rest of the record is great, and 'Summertime Blues' as a punk cover is explosive and lovely finish to the record.  The school week has been uneventful and dull, proving that school really is just not interesting anymore. During Monday's tutor period I visited Becci to organise an appointment with Connexions, and I was told that she would try and contact her and I was then given an information card. My thoughts then convinced me that I wasn't going to get an appointment and should just try and forget everything.  However I did get an appointment, I bumped into Becci on Tuesday and hse informed me that I were to have a meeting with the advisor at Connexions today. I was told to expect a slip taking me away from one of my lessons today, so that was that I thought, I had a meeting today.  Then I remembered.  'Oh crap, I have Ecology study at Lawns Woods in Science today. Lesson four. No doubt I'll get called for then, and I won't be there to go, I bet she does.'  And my suspicions were correct, when I went to the office to check, I was informed that I was called for at lesson four and I replied that I was away on ecology study.  Damn.  Back I went to Becci, who told me that the Connexions person has gone for lunch and may come back, but may not. So after lunch I waited at the office for five minutes with Jessica, then gave up on all hope that she had returned.  Wednesday I was given a note to say that I had a meeting with Connexions on Thursday at 9am, so that was good. The rest of the day really flew by and I can't renember much anyway.  The meeting with Connexions was a bit tense at times . . . There were a lot of awkward silences where I couldn't think of what to say, and unsure of whether I should say some things. First we discussed careers, and I managed to find out a bit more about journalism and music, which was good. After about half an hour of discussing careers, I was given a little card and on there it listed many things that I may have wished to talk about. Briefly spoke about health, which moved on to how much I sleep, and this led to being asked if I felt a little depressed. I brushed it off as hormones, as when you think about it, it really is, and that was the end of the discussion, although I was advised to go see the school nurse. I thanked the person there and went to tutor as usual.  Nothing had happened until Friday, which was my mentoring meeting at school. I do not see the point in them, you go to the school for ten minutes to discuss whats going well for you and whats not going well for you, then you leave and have the day off. I'm not complaining, but it does seem a little silly if you ask me.  With the day off, I went into town with Matt, at the very early time of 9am (I consider this early as I am a lazy child), most shops were closed as expected, but we killed sometime then headed off to check out deals on XBoxs. In the end Matt went for a bundle offer that Game had, £150 for an XBox, extra controller, and two games of his choice, providing that they cost under £40. With a tenner left, he gave it to me on the one condition that I continue to work well in school, and I promised too, so trip to HMV!  Picked up 'Led Zeppelin IV' and 'Hit To Death In The Future Head' by The Flaming Lips, in a buy one get one free offer, came to £11 in the end. I was pleased I decided to bring my own measly balance of £3 with me, as it turned out to be life-saving, I had to get my hands on Led Zeppelin IV or I would cry!  Walked to Matt's after, and played Project Gotham Racing for a while, was fun, I managed to do over 100mph in a Volkswagen, and I tell you now, you haven't lived until you've driven a Volkwagen at over 100mph! Or maybe not, but there you go, thats me. Landmines on Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow are funny. Matt decided the only way to get over them must be by jumping, how wrong he was. The screen was shrouded from the mine explosion and a little, 'pfffft' could be heard. Both of us burst into fits of laughter, and then got past the first batch of mines. We continued walking along and all of a sudden, the screen became shrouded again and a little, 'pfffft' could be heard. There was silence for a second, and then we erupted into laughter once more. I have no idea, but at the time it just seemed hilarious.  I left at about 1:15pm to see Jess, and stayed there for a while. Nothing really happened, except for watching Jess be a little clumsy around the kitchen. Had to leave at 2 because her mum might return, and Jess wasn't allowed any visitors whilst her mum was out, so I left, went to Tesco's and bought some Dr Pepper.  Knocked for Rebecca but she wasn't in, (I was told later on MSN that she was in, but opened the door and I had gone) and I began walking home. Looking at my watch, it told me that it was 2:30pm, I thought about what I could do. I could go back to my school and offer a helping hand, although the mentoring meetings would end pretty soon, and I wouldn't reach there until about 2:45pm anyway. Then I thought, what about my old school? Doesn't school finish there at 3pm? I could go there and say hi to the teacher that I knew. Going along with this plan I walked towards my old school, aware that I had plenty of time.  I passed my old school at 2:45 thinking I could see my nan, and so I did. As I walked past the school I could confirm that they were in school, as children were doing PE outside. I arrived at my nan, who seemed surprised and pleased to see me, and also told me that school finished at 3:15 there, not 3:00 as I previously thought. This gave me some time to relax, so I had a drink and spoke to my nan for a while.  My old school seems very small to me now, and it seems that a lot of teachers have left now, leaving only Mrs Ash, Mr Morris and Mrs Harris the familiar faces that I remember. I spoke to Mrs Ash first, being my teacher for my last two years of junior school. She recognised me instantly, which is a little different considering others took a while to recognise me. I offered to help them around the school for their last three days, and waited in the reception to talk to Mrs Harris.  The school is still the same in my opinion, it seems smaller to me seeing as I do go to a secondary school, but I still see a lot of work that my year made around the school. Most of it was the abstract paintings that have been scattered across the hall, and some leaves all put together to resemble a tree, was supposed to show that the school is united, I'm pretty sure thats what it meant. I do believe they have better equipment for theatrical productions now, even though the hall is short of space for a proper stage, they've still got a good PA system and lights, which I consider excellent for a primary school.  After talking to Mrs Harris I went home and found out that I was bought a new mobile phone! Woo yay! If I remember, its an NEC e313 on 3 pay as you go. Its all spiffy and has a camera, which makes a vast improvement from my previous phone, so I was happy. My only fault in it is that it has the length of my TV remote control, but seeing as I can fit my CD Player in my pocket, I'm sure I could get it in my pcoket with ease. Still can't remember my phone number, and I haven't jotted it down somewhere either so I have to get that done.  Using my phone I downloaded the video to XFM's alternative England Euro 2004 anthem, 'Born In England'. I have to say that the song will probably sell better than 'Altogether Now' as it follows the traits of many England anthems. The song is patriotic all the way through and I guess thats what makes a football anthem sell, even though I would like to see 'Altogether Now' sell more.  The weekend managed to pass by uneventfully, and I got bored to a point where I began to write the blog entry that you happen to be reading right now, except for that I got bored of that, saved a draft and continued it on Tuesday (the day I'm writing it now).  By Monday my U2 album still hadn't arrived, but unfortunately not a thing could be done about it because it wasn't 14 days since the order, so I just hoped it would arrive on Tuesday.  It still hadn't arrived.  I did get two nice e-mails through my inbox though. One said that my order for 'Beautiful Freak' by The Eels had been despatched now that it came into stock, and another saying that they had despatched 'War' by U2. War was the CD I had been waiting for. So as it seems, the CD that I had been waiting for over a week now, hadn't even been despatched yet. I felt a bit angry, they did send me an e-mail over a week ago saying they did despatch it, but this one had told me the same.  This brings the blog up-to-date for now, sorry its been so long without an entry, I just guess I've been lazy. I promise I'll get the pictures from Salcombe up too, thats one job I've been avoiding due to about 100 shots ruined by rain on lens, so I need to edit it all out before I can do anything.  Ciao.         "
108,Taurus,"           Some  urlLink more insight  into this Ted Rall cartoon fiasco:  'Ted Rall's cartoons could have run in every paper every day since 9/11 and there will still be kids who saw Tillman's choice as a remarkable act. (Tillman's Choice: there's a phrase that sums up quite a lot, doesn't it?) People like Rall are sitting on the curb, feet in the gutter, watching the parade go past, smirking at the guy with the baton, sneering at the cheerleaders. Everyone else watching the parade thinks I wonder if there will be elephants! And when they do appear, he rolls his eyes. Elephants. How obvious.  You want to live like that? I don't want to live like that. Because when you see red all the time you miss things. My favorite panel of the cartoon had Tillman signing up and asking 'Do I get to go kill Arabs.' Of course Rall knows that it's not literally true, but it's true in some metaphysical sense, which makes it truer than reality itself. And it's a bitter joke, don't you know, because that's the unspoken subtext, isn't it? ' Damn.  This guy's good.  What makes this especially good is he's touched on something that I see in myself: ...when you see red all the time you miss things. Life goes by too fast to miss things.         "
109,Leo,"        I found the quote 'Death is more universal than life; everyone dies, but not everyone lives'. This is true. Thinking about death is not being pessimistic. Death is a part of our lives (verbal irony...haha). It meets us in the beginning, middle, or end. But once again, we find death cannot exist without life. Life comes first, and Death comes later. Does this mean life is of more importance? More powerful? Does it mean Life = Good, Death = Evil? We have been conditioned to think so. Conditioned, or born with those ideals? Is it something automatically programmed into our brains before we are born? Or is it something we are taught to think by ourselves? Then again, some are born dead. Death inflirtrates a woman's womb. Everything is balanced for a reason but what reason? Death vs. Life, Rich vs. Poor, Good vs. Evil, Heaven vs. Hell. None can exist without it's counterpart, because without the counterpart we wouldn't have much diversity in our opinions, now would we? We would have no right or wrong. It's a cycle. The simplest of things are the hardest to understand. So simple that it enables us to create twisted versions of it and accept it for the truth when the original concept has all the answers.   Yes, that was really random....haha....   DEATH is stronger than all the governments because the governments are men and men die and then death laughs: Now you see ’em, now you don’t.   DEATH is stronger than all proud men and so death snips proud men on the nose, throws a pair of dice and says: Read ’em and weep.   DEATH sends a radiogram every day: When I want you I’ll drop in—and then one day he comes with a master-key and lets himself in and says: We’ll go now.   DEATH is a nurse mother with big arms: ’Twon’t hurt you at all; it’s your time now; you just need a long sleep, child; what have you had anyhow better than sleep?           "

112,Cancer,"       I love Terry Pratchett  Well I'm halfway through painting my room green, and am goin to 'PARTAY' this weekend at mornington (the shocking spelling is carried over from mums friend). My circle firefox extension totally broke on me, so I decided to rewrite it (i just couldn't find what was wrong with it, kept getting an error message on the first line in the file, regardless of how I changed it).  Orkut's community is mediochre, its kinda dull actually so anyone desperate to get in, I suggest you wait until its a tad more mature. I also converted all my music to the vorbis (.ogg) format, and I can't wait till I get a mac (preferably a powerbook g5 when they come out). Suse is nice, but OSX is miles smoother, and I love the eyecandy. Oh, by the way gmail is totally awesome!, its filters and conversation management are incredible, the only thing lacking is autoforwarding and pop links, but I can easily live without those.  Spiderman 2 was great, but I reckon thunderbirds will be better. I can't wait!          "

116,Gemini,"             The French Ambassador to the United States, Jean-David Levitte, is here in the museum.  He is being given a private tour of the Van Gogh to Mondrian exhibit.  I find this very exciting, especially since it is being done without a lot of fanfare or stress.  I wonder if he would even be here if it weren't for Van Gogh.  What does he think of Seattle?  Why is he even up here in the Pacific Northwest anyway?         "
117,Aquarius,"       We’ve been smoking pot and coloring those black, felt maker designs from your childhood, the ones with all the hippie swirls and cascading butterflies and the sun and moon dancing merrily in the cosmos.  We’ve been doing that on a Monday.  I called in again, he works overnight tonight.  But now the munchies have attacked I’m covered with a  slick wet stickiness because we’ve been deterring the air conditioner for as long as possible.  These humid stubborn summers of flaking nostrils and frizzy hair, they’re long gone now, I can almost smell the ocean again.  I tried to make all my colors fade together, something legibly connected, but it’s just a Mardi Gras poster painted almost by number if not by name.  It’s near impossible to keep the bright psychedelic colors of the 60’s and 70’s from bleeding onto the white spaces of the paper.              It’s so hot here I’m impatient, I’m pushing against my skin, this wet paper clung to my entire body.  I’m pushing against my constant failure, my inability to be anything more than a brief afterthought of minor cunning, just a few more jokes and I’d be doing standup in seedy, smoky clubs called Ballroom Brawler or the Red Saloon.  I keep telling myself to do something, to go somewhere, to become born once again.  No, not jesus, me and jesus… Well, he left after I kissed his cheek.  He left when it got too serious, when my words weren’t just hollow affections beating from my heart.  He left and we’ve parted ways but I see his photography in the National Geographic at times.  Or the Riverfront Times, the transvestites offering massages in the last three pages.  The Wild Side or whatever that column is called.  No born again like I’ve been missing near the caves and caverns on the river.  I’ve been missing in action, the pod manifested in my bathwater as I dozed, the tubes invading my orifices like tubular cream snakes.  They’ve been masquerading as this machinery.              Suddenly I wake up and it’s 8:30 every day, every moment.  My entire life consists of 8:30 in the mornings.  This is my interim existence.  I wait and wait for the glitch to snap, the record to skip and right itself, but no, every moment is the beginning of a day that never goes anywhere.  So I resist, it’s small time mutiny, like petty shoplifting of revolutions.  I call into work and console myself with marijuana and Ben and Jerry’s half baked ice cream.  I console myself with hours of mindless television.  I console myself with the emphatic promise of tomorrow.  Tomorrow I will work out, tomorrow my face will smooth and retract from this swollen berry, tomorrow I will write the fourth chapter, tomorrow I will feel like a woman and I won’t push Mike away because pot infects me like paranoia cancer and I feed off the decay.  Tomorrow is like the trim of a soft cloud holding its cumulous bushels in the corner of my house and I stare constantly at its billowing cotton and I can feel the promise of tomorrow.  Something has to be better than this right here, right now.                  "
118,Gemini,"             Well, it is now Monday, and not only did I NOT work on my novel, but I did not finish my assignment by Thursday.

124,Libra,"   It has been a week since the passing of President Ronald Regan.  Seven days have been filled with bitter sweet moments and memories as this nation says farewell to one of our heroes.  These are grounding moments of reflection for the country and for us as individuals.  They give us pause for self-evaluation and they provide for us a window of insight into the impact one man can have on the world.  True heroes are rare.  Ronald Regan was one of my heroes.  Regan contributed heavily to the image I hold in my minds eye of what true leadership looks like.  It has been a privilege to be reacquainted with much of those images over this past week.  His departure from public life left an empty stage upon which he has returned for a final farewell to a nation that loved him. Those who aspire to great things are lucky to have lived after Ronald Regan. He left for us a clear example of the value and importance of passionately working to improve the world.  Reflection on Regan's life yields to those who are searching, a sure way in which to affect lasting and valuable change.  I believe the late President would have advised those of us who are planning to lead this country forward to chiefly and genuinely care about our fellow man and to passionately pursue those things that are righteous and true.  The political stage needs more candidates who have the strength to do so.  Regan's strength and the example he set should be a model for us all, it demonstrates the impact of living a life of true purpose.  Let this lesson be one which resonates within our hearts and inspires us to do the same.   "

We are still children after all And the grief sweeps in as we think of you So much pain it hurts to recall  Sometimes I want to forget how you died And just simply think of you But for some reason, it pains me more If I try but I can't see you There are some nights when I've dreamt of you You hold me while I sit and cry A small favor given by your midnight visits But in the morning, another lie These years have brought on clarity anew Only love will bring us through And when the next two years pass me by Please know, Jared, I miss you  "

139,Libra,"                 So I'm thinking (this just means passing thought, not definite) of getting a nose job.  I snore okay.  I would like to fix that... well that and I hate my nose like huge-time.  I surfed for a bit to see how much it'd set me back, and they only run like 3 grand.  Maybe next year.  I just don't know how to explain the time off, or the different nose to people at work.  Am I incredibly vain?  Well of course.  Aren't we all. What do you think?  I mean I don't really think it'd be a waste of money, say I'm gonna live for like at least 40 more years, that's just pennies a day.

I think that Protestants lost something when they got rid of confession....before I start on a short rant...let me preface with this....I don't think that a priest has anything to do with me being forgiven...thats just silly...but there is a lot of value in admitting your sins outloud to another human being...chances are if you can't say what you have done to another human being...then  you shouldn't be doing it in the first place....there is something powerful about letting someone else in on what you are struggling with....it makes you feel like you are not alone...there is someone else in on it...at least they know about it...that's what counselors do...they just listen...and that is very helpful...to just listen...thats the first thing that I had to learn when I was counseling...don't try to fix things...just listen...guys...what...to.....fix..... things....well at least this guy does....  now this leads me to something new altogether...actually something that I have been talking about for a long time....authenticity....being transparent...I know that if a pastor would walk to the pulpit and say that he doubts...there would be half the congregation shaking their head and saying 'me too, I am not alone'....I think that worst thing is feeling alone in your doubt....it makes me realize that I am not alone...and its okay....honesty...honesty...that is where its at....lets quit playing church...and start being the church...

143,Pisces,"       .......... ouch. ..........  i kinda like that in cyber world i've been frozen in the permanent gesture of 'ugh.' for several days.    it's a poignant metaphor for how the family system is doing.   sunday -- the last of advent -- lynn and i were sprawled across the couches in the living room trying to keep our eyelids up high enough to regret missing the last sunday in the liturgical cycle -- enough to make sure that jae & add weren't taking the keys to the minivan and hitting the road.  lynn said she was worried that someone would just find our bodies all huddled together in the house together.    we've never been sick at the same time in eleven years of cohabitation & now to be facing this crud with two small humans fairly dependent upon us.  lets just say that all my moral objections to convenience food were overwhelmed in the struggle to survive.   (also a revelatory incident about who gets to complain about mass/kitsch culture...only we who have the werewithall to see it from above...instead of from inside...)

The author (so far) writes about coming of age in evangelical fundamentalism.  a terrain more familiar to me than any other.  and I realize that what's moving me so much about reading this book is to realize that this total stranger -- who has survived enough to put together an amazing novel -- experience(s/d) these wounds that i feel so profoundly.   I said to Lynn:  and sometimes I just look around me at the evangelical world and it looks like more people than not are just signing on the dotted line, saying, hey, yeah! me too! i want in for another generation!    and i can understand that rationally but i can't feel it very well at all.    i usually use cynicism and irony to talk about growing up in the church.  it's a much more comfortable stance in response.  but this guy's writing is doing the other thing. what seems like the faithful thing.  He's just saying --   ouch.  i'm gonna write more sometime here...but not today...its the andy-lynn-jaelyn-addison Christmas -- we're off to the farm tomorrow and Michigan after...  peace~    "
144,Sagittarius,"             Since there were no big movies that came out today that I wanted to see (although I probably will rent  Collateral  when it comes out on DVD), the movie that made today's cut was  The Manchurian Candidate.  Well, the reviews were definitely right on this one; it was an extremely good movie and a welcome change from last week. If you've seen the original (I haven't), it supposedly changes quite a bit of stuff up (such as who is running for office, etc.). No complaints from me though, and it's definitely one of my recommended movies of the summer.          "

149,Libra,"        Hello from my beautiful new Oakland home! :-)      You probably guessed that I finally set my new desk up and hooked up my computer. (Don't tell the guys who live upstairs, but Mel and I are piggybacking [stealing] their wireless Internet. Shhh! [That just means money I would've spent on Internet will now go to digital cable, ha!]) All I did was plug in my wireless USB adapter and  VOILA! , I'm online. WAH!       So here's an update to tide you over til I finish unpacking, etc...      Mel told me before I moved in that there's a youngster (undergrad at Berkeley) who lives above us (his room is above mine) who used to give her and her old roommate problems. He'd play bass and drums loud, play his music loud, have loud sex... He hasn't been a problem for a while, because Mel and Barbara (her old roomie) would go upstairs and knock on the door and complain. But Mel and I ran into him the other day on our way out (to Target for some shopping) and she was like, 'Oh, Brian, I want you to meet Audrey. She just moved in with me.' She said how she thinks we should all sit down and come up with some common courtesy rules about noise control. I agree. I'm going back to school (I have two weeks of freedom left!) and I'm not trying to be all gangster and walking my ass upstairs to curse that fucker out because I can't study.       But the loud sex thing? I'm not tripping off that. I've had roommates with skanky One Minute Man boyfriends--I've heard rhythm-less bed-banging. (Don't know what's worse, no rhythm or no stamina/endurance?) I think Brian-Who-Lives-Upstairs is a Ten Second Brother (but he sounds like he's got a little rhythm). I heard some bad-banging at like 2 AM this morning--I mentally timed it and it seriously didn't go on for too long. In my head I was like, 'BOO! I feel sorry for whoever's lying underneath you all unsatisfied right now! BOO SOME MORE! BOOOOOO!' The least he could've done was go for a second ten-second round, but he didn't.        Look at me, talking shit already about the neighbors.  But it's okay. The really good loud-sex noises will be coming from my room soon (haha).      Anyhow!      I moved in the first wave of my things on Friday afternoon/evening. Then Mel and I headed to Ikea to do some shopping for a TV/media stand. I actually wanted to furnish my room Crate & Barrel or Pottery Barn style, just because I didn't want to get callouses from building my furniture (I really moved in with little in terms of furniture [just a desk chair, bookcase and a mattress]), but I shall have an Ikea room, too. My new furniture (dresser, bedframe, desk, chair) has cost me a little over $400. It's not so bad--I'm just not down with the raw wood look, so I need to stain/varnish my shit so it doesn't look so cheap (haha!).      Saturday I rented this crazy 'luxury' minivan (is there such a thing?) and drove solo to Bakersfield to fetch boxes out of my storage space. (It was a daylong mission. I drove down, got my shit, then drove back up. I left the Bay Area around noon and returned about 9 PM.) When Daddy and I packed up our house so Junior (my brother) could move in, I marked about 4 boxes with the letters 'SF' on them, so I could easily spot them when I went to retrieve them. Unfortunately Daddy and my uncles put some of those boxes in the far back of the storage space, behind big furniture that I'm too weak to move, so I only came back with 2 boxes (none of which had any kitchen stuff that I wanted/needed).  The trip wasn't bad at all. I rocked out to Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Justin Timberlake the whole way down (I made sure to bring CDs that made me want to either dance or sing along so I wouldn't fall asleep.) I ate In-N-Out at my half-way pit stop.  And I visited Mama's grave. Instead of flowers, this time I brought her a turtle. I was annoyed that I had to cut my visit/talk short, though. The sprinklers were on at the cemetery, so I got caught a couple times as it went around and around. I think my mom understands why I had to cut my visit short. Before I left, I told Mama about my move and how she would like both Mel and my new home.     Sunday afternoon Hatty, Mel, Adrienne and her friend (visiting from Australia) John, helped me move the very last wave of things from Pacifica to Oakland. The biggest pain in the ass was my mattress. I had no problem transporting that shit from SF to Pacifica (shorter distance, and I had more rope to work with), but this time around it was a nightmare. We dropped Hatty off at BART in Colma, retied my mattress, stopped off at In-N-Out in Daly City, stopped at Serramonte Mall and instead reshifted boxes to squeeze my mattress into Ade's minivan, then we were on our way.      Anyhow, let me go. I need to run errands. I need to mail Jeremy his present so maybe it will arrive in Philly in time for his bday, and (EEK!) rush Hatty on a flyer design so I can get Hyphen flyers made for the AAJA Unity Conference for Todd and Ursula in DC this whole week/end.      I need to get my shit in order for the Hyphen meeting Thursday. Ugh!      "
150,Leo,             another dream where i'm being ignored... maybe i should take the hint...         
151,Virgo,"           A month ago I posted some  urlLink  commentary   on Bill Cosby's recent rants.  The Cos has been raising hell about how his fellow African-Americans, namely those living in poverty, are increasingly responsible for their lack of upward mobility.    As a follow-up, I highly recommend this excellent  urlLink  column   by none other than Henry Louis Gates, Jr. in the New York Times.  Gates draws on the Cosby comments as well as the now famous DNC speech of Barack Obama.  Here's a teaser:  Go into any inner-city neighborhood,' Barack Obama said in his keynote address to the Democratic National Convention, 'and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach kids to learn. They know that parents have to parent, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white.' In a speech filled with rousing applause lines, it was a line that many black Democratic delegates found especially galvanizing. Not just because they agreed, but because it was a home truth they'd seldom heard a politician say out loud.   Why has it been so difficult for black leaders to say such things in public, without being pilloried for 'blaming the victim'? Why the huge flap over Bill Cosby's insistence that black teenagers do their homework, stay in school, master standard English and stop having babies? Any black person who frequents a barbershop or beauty parlor in the inner city knows that Mr. Cosby was only echoing sentiments widely shared in the black community.   (p.s. May this post serve as a not-so-subtle plug for the New York Times Online.  Yes it requires registration, but if there is any single publication worth going through the hassle of filling out and submitting a free registration form its this one.  If you don't like registering because you are worried about getting junk email, get a throwaway free Hotmail or Yahoo email account if you have to, but don't block yourself out of the Times for that reason alone.)

153,Gemini,"           How can I keep up the speed at which I'm posting here lately? I'm like a machine.  The 24 season finale has come and gone. Ultimately, it felt kind of ho hum. The final confrontation between Jack Bauer and Kingsley felt completely anti-climactic. Perhaps if he'd been built up into more of a menace, but his introduction simply felt rushed. It was as if the writers had plotted 5 or 6 ace moments in the show, and tried to build 24 episodes around them. It just didn't gel completely.  Meanwhile, the Buffy finale completely rocked my socks off. I haven't been watching the new episodes all that much, but after watching a few of the recent episodes, its dawned on me that I'm missing some good shit.  Phone Booth. If you've seen the trailer, or even just know the premise, you've seen the movie. And that just isn't enough. Hitchcocks REAR WINDOW is similar in that its based on a premise that involves a guy, a killer, and a single location. The difference was that Hitchcocks flick was highly entertaining. There were some great performances, camera work, and just a sense of classiness to the flick. Phone Booth, however, lacked in every respect, and seemed ultimately lifeless and trashy.         "

158,Capricorn,"           Euskadi ta Askatasuna (ETA) is fighting for an independent Basque state in northern Spain and southwestern France.  The group has killed nearly 850 people since 1968, typically using car bombs or shootings. The number of ETA killings had been falling, from 23 in 2000 to three in 2003.  Spain, the United States and the European Union have listed ETA as a terrorist organization. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who survived an ETA attack while he was opposition leader in 1995, made eliminating the group a top priority.  In 2002 the Spanish government banned the Basque political party Batasuna, which it described as ETA’s political wing. The party denied the charge. Batasuna won 10 percent of the vote in Basque parliamentary elections in May 2001.  ETA has been under pressure in recent years with 179 suspected members detained during 2003 and a total of 650 suspects arrested since 2000, mostly in Spain and France.          "
159,Sagittarius,"        revenge is mine?  Always thinking and always considering the other point of view... or at least trying to.  Yesterday I was thinking about how my ex-husband gave up everything for the woman he now lives with.  He gave up a stable and comfortable life with his wife & children to be with her.  In certain circumstances it seems like a wonderful thing - giving up everything for true love... I just hope she was worth it.  I mean that wholeheartedly.  If he's found 'the one' then he did what was right for his heart and soul.  Of course, that doesn't excuse him from his financial and paternal responsibilities... he may still learn to balance everything properly.  And then I started thinking, as bad as its been for me, he hasn't had it so easy either.  In the past three years, he lost the best paying job he'd ever had, he was evicted and ended up moving in with the new girlfriend (perhaps only out of necessity?), was unemployed for almost a year, then lost his new job after only 3 months.  On top of that, he has been the subject of child support enforcement legal action and now has a warrant out for his arrest.  Pretty shitty year, if you ask me.  All I can wonder is, is she worth it?  And while she has stood beside him through a lot, will she stand firm through whatever else comes?    Then, there is this little, ugly satisfaction in knowing that once he left my happy little world, he lost it all.  Diva out.         "

165,Aquarius,"             By: TIRI!!(all rights reserved)  Bill Moritz, known as the kidnapped boy, was a guy that had big expectations in his life, he wanted to finish school to go to university and study what he like best, ecology. He was a boy that liked exploration and he always said that he will dedicate all his life to go on adventures all around the world doing what he liked most, climbing. He had a great childhood, but when he was an adolescent he had a bad incident, he was kidnapped and kept for almost a year. But even though he had this bad experience in the past he had dreams of going to the highest mountains and reaching the top. Actually one of his adventures happened two weeks ago, when he decided to make a journey to El Cocui Snow Mountain. He was so excited he couldn’t wait one more day; he packed and got organized and left everything ready for his trip. Finally, the perfect and expected wild day arrived. He got on his car turned the radio on and left the station where they were giving the new because he wanted to know how the climate was on the area. Few minutes latter he stopped surprised of what he had heard over the news. He was really worried and scared, “The Cocui was filled up with guerrilla and the kidnap statistics was of a 90% probability.” But even though he was scared and not really sure if he should continue, he filled with courage and carried on with his dream.  The next day he arrived to one of the most dangerous mountain of El Cocui, named La Laguna de los Verdes. Bill started to feel and smell the soft and comfortable aroma of the wind and he saw the beautiful colors of nature; he felt so secure and happy, he knew that he was where he belonged, free and in peace. After a moment he heard a really strange noise that made him come back to reality and remember his past and what he had heard the day before. He was frightened, he felt as if he were living a flashback. He heard some gunshots, he was frightened, he didn’t know what to do he was paralyzed; he just wished he had returned when he had the chance. He started to run in no direction and after a while of running he ended up in a dark and endless cave. He didn’t notice that in the cave there was some ice blocks falling from the top and that in the floor there were some human footsteps, so he continued walking knowing that there he would be secure. After a while of walking, he heard some screaming; they came from far away, it seemed to be from a girl, a KIDNAPPED girl, who was screaming for help. He continued walking and when he least expected he was eye covered and he felt that someone grabbed his arm and painfully twisted it to his back, he felt as it thy were taking his arm away. He heard a man’s voice ordering him to walk, but because he was so scared it seemed difficult to do it. After a while of not knowing to where he was taken, he heard the girls’ voice again. Every time the girl voice got closer, and closer. Then instantaneously the bandage was off and he had the chance to look down and when he did he saw a small girl. The man made him sit down beside her and ordered him to stay quiet. Even though the man told him not to, he talked for a while with the girl letting the time pass and the night to arrive. When it did arrived he didn’t remember falling a sleep. At some point in the middle of the night he woke up all sweaty. He was home, in his bed and the day of his journey hadn’t arrived. He realized that he was living a lie, everything was ok when he figured out what had happened he calmed down, nothing was happening. He would be living tomorrow and his trip was going to be the first of so many trips to come.          "
166,Leo,             it has been awhile since the last... another dream         
167,Leo,"       Yesterday was, all in all, a pretty good day. Even if certain people that needed certain rides to work from certain hospitals didn't give me money for gas or the bridge. I took the oppratunity to go to lunch with my Mom since I was in the East Bay anyways and it's been a while since I've gone to lunch with her. I then went to Cody's Books in Berkeley and looked at (Surprise!) some books. I bought one. For the purpose of suspence I will not reveal what the book that I bought was untill a later date.   I went home, played some video games, and took a long nap. That nap ended up screwing me in the end. I woke up, went to Kinders and talked to a couple friends for about 5 minutes before heading off to a pool tournament. I ended up taking second place and wining a heafty sum of $35. Not too shabby considering that I got lucky in quite a few games. But that's just the way it goes, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes it gets you...I guess I got it last night, but it wont be long before it gets me back. What a jerk.   I ended the night be getting a sticky Sobe from Wolves and talking to Miss Macy for a little bit. I went home, played some more video games and went to bed to try to sleep, something which I failed miserably at. It's now the morning of today and I got about one or two hours of sleep. I guess the bear did get me back...while I was in bed, he is a jerk!         "
168,Cancer,"       I apologize to Alanna and Heather and Becky for being a lazy fuck. I have been this lazy fuck since my last post, as you might notice, because no post follows the last post except this post, which has a significant time difference, which is why I am a lazy fuck. Understand? I don't.  Becca's gig was bloody awesome. Allow me to recollect. Several people (Alanna, Elise, Kevin, Brock, Laylee, actor-god Eric) arrived to listen to the precursor presentation, which was performed by a pleasant chap named Daniel Shank ( i think ). He wrote excellent poetry and essays. However, the greatest quantity of people arrived to listen to Becca Becca fucking-goddess-I-love-her-and-her-pickless-guitar. She played my personal fave  Morning Sickness as the second song!!!  One moment: conniption.  Okay, better now. But anyway, a whole crowd of school mates flooded in to listen to  holy divine  songs. This included Rachel, Evan, Katherine, Tarah, Lauren H., etc, as well as DOY members (e.g., Morgan). Becca is goddess. Sorry. But she also played 'Telephone' (or 'my telephone' I forget), which rocks everything.  Change subject: Her songs were damn excellent. All of them.  Change subject again: I am semi-free, for I turned in the hellish English paper I referred to in earlier posts. So that is over. However, señor Oh-My-Gawwwd (that's how he says it) Espinosa is giving us some shit test that no true human can actually study for. So that will be absolute hell.  Heather wants my Gollum voice on her cell phone. I am happied.  Lessee....nothing else to ramble about. Wait, I wrote something a few moments ago that I personally like. Though I may like because it is the only thing I have written in - what? - a month, perhaps.   Transparent  Glass ball Hovering between the glare of One thousand suns streaming past Some inborn light No light will last Because ever light has a shadow Thrown off carelessly And it constantly changes The light and the shadow Always, when one changes The other Changes And the photons filter through The clear sphere Bounce off my retina, invert Invert again, but I have myopia In both nuances of meaning Glass balls are light bulbs And crystal orbs That the cheap seer plugs in To see my face, warped in the glass Except that little bubble That the blowers couldn’t suck out They’re only blowers And they were creating a glass ball That had a bit of blue to it Or any color you would like To sell to some cheap seer in the Palm and tarot shops That spit artificial light from light bulbs And every time the night goes dark My vision It’s blurry Because I don’t want to use my lenses I want to see by myself It never happens like that Too many shadows to blend Made by one thousand suns Streaming past my car window And shining on the Glass.   Cheers, mortals. I cannot feel my toes, which are in my socks, which are in my boots. That says something about how cold it is.   listening to:  Ben Folds Live: Army    "

172,Virgo,        Bruised and sore...  I joined a Mui Thai kick boxing gym last week. I've only taken a couple of classes. 1. my ass hurts 2. my legs are totally bruised up 3. my ass hurts  Conclusion: kick boxing is a pain in the ass.  It's so much fun!

174,Gemini,"       It's Friday and I am ready for the weekend. I did a lot of walking yesterday (had to walk to the dentist). So I've got to get my bottom two wisdom teeth out and I'm actually looking forward to it as much as that's possible. The Dentist said that I will keep having chronic problems with them until I get them out, but after that they won't hurt anymore and I will feel a whole lot better. So if anyone has any advice or stories, please feel free to tag me.    "

176,Aquarius,"                 Lots of new things on my end.. too much to post.  I went away for the weekend with my 'friend' M. and had a blast, we are now dating. I completely broke things off with C. That was hard, but it had to be done. I have to start figuring out what all that I want and need, and start fulfilling those needs. My relationship with C. wasn't fulfilling that. He helped me thru alot in this past year, and I will always remember that.    The big thing that is on my mind though, is parenting, how some people chose and some don't. Well I didn't.  I did choose to keep my daughter however, and the first few years, were hard, but I loved her so much, and now..  I just don't feel that I'm good for her anymore and I don't know what to do. I am really getting tired of people telling me that I'm a good mother, and what would she do without me. I'm not saying I don't want to be part of her life, I'm just saying, I'm not doing good, being her soul support.  I'm always crabby with her, for the last year, I loose my patience so easily with her, and I just see our relationship getting worse and worse. I mean, well for example... Probably in the last year.. I can count on my hands the number of times that I have bathed her by myself, that is just one of those things that I either forget, or just don't take the time to do, or something.. I really don't know what it is. I gave her a bath last week, but before that.. I really haven't . I only gave her a bath then, because she had peed all over. My gram usually gives her a bath here, before that, I always asked Wil to make sure she got a bath. Sure... I always make sure she's dressed, and gets to school.. and stuff like that, but is it enough? I don't think so. I feel like I will never get where I need to be, I will never be able to provide for her like I need to if I can't get away from her. I hate saying this, but in reality, I really in a way.. want to get rid of her. Not in the sense some people think. My aunt would take care of her for me, I know this, and it would be ideal. But would it be fair. WOuld it be fair for anyone involved. Would it make things better? or worse? I dunno, I'm so confused.. and noone seems to listen to me when I say I can't handle parenting anymore..    They just don't get it. I feel like noone understands. Maybe because I don't understand. I don't understand, how...  I can go from never wanting to be away from my baby, to hardly being able to stand being around her. And its not because she's a bad.. girl.. She is .. and always has been a good girl.. she's so perfect..  so loving..  so beautiful.  I just don't want to mess her up, and I see it happening already. I hate myself for it. I just want to make her life better. And I can't do that the way I am now. I just can't.                "
177,Aries,"                 Met Lim this morning, then we went to SPC to get help from Raymond.MATHS..no choice la..cos there's a maths quiz coming up and our lecturer is damn boring. Seriously, yesterday was the very first time I really can listen and pay attention during maths with minimal distraction.  Went to TP in the afternoon with Janice and Mandy..studed in the library till it close..Badminton at 5pm, TP sports hall..I only managed to do little stuff at TP cos I can't study outside..many pple plus distractions..so irritating.  Headed for TM after that..Went NTUC to buy fruits and bars. Then Janice didn't allow me to go home. So accompanied her to YAMAHA..she wanna buy a new guitar. Rich girl.       "

179,Capricorn,"                 Today is Ezra's first day of school. Thinking we'd have plenty of time to park and leisurely walk in we left the house at 7:35. Wrong! OMG between the crossing guards, hundreds of cars and the parking nazis he was almost late to school. So, I dropped him at the corner, told him to wait, I parked and then sprinted to catch up to him and help him carry all his junk in. Good grief they make them get a lot of supplies.  So we walk to his class watching everyone in their little uniforms (So cute!) and he sits down, I give him a 'quick-nobody-can-see-kiss' and head back to the car, hoping I don't get a ticket. I think tomorrow we're walking or riding bikes. We're not that far but it's hot out! After walking 5 blocks ya get all sweaty. Hm. Perhaps I could work that into my daily workout. Now there is an idea. But that car/parking situation was horrible. They didn't make the lots big enough. Granted it was the first day of school but OMG what a zoo.  Enough complaining about that. I hope that the day goes well, he remembers to bring home his lunchbox and backpack and starts to make friends.  In other news, I will start to be HAIR FREE!!!! Finally gonna get all that lovely extra facial hair taken care of. Lasered right off. SSssssssssssssizzle. Actually it isn't a laser, it is an IPL system (http://www.bocabodylight.com) and won't hurt like the ruby laser I had four years ago. Friday is my first appointment and I can't wait! Ahhhh to be rid of it is dreamy. Will take a few months but sooooooooo worth it. Smoooth skin. Noooo bumps. No stubble. No feeling like a man 'cause I have to shave. Ugh. Okay back to your regular scheduled program. And I have to go get my munchkin. Leaving early this time. And as if on cue there is the thunder. Sigh.               "

183,Virgo,"        Turn offs...  Okay, there are many turn offs, but carnal sins are the following: 1.  Don't ever fucken hang up on me. 2.  Don't ever fucken walk away from me.  If you are a dood, and commit one of the above mentioned offenses, you deserve a beatdown.  If you're a girl and are an offender....NO MORE DATES! (and if there are, you're paying!)  Both of these things happened to me last night!  I was so pissed I drank a bottle of wine for EACH sin committed.  I was so drunk I actually forgave the person!  Full forgiveness wasn't attained though until me n my buddy H.O.S. (Harvester of Sorrow) hit up a mid-day round of golf.  Hot as fuck...shot a 101 but got a great tan.  On a lighter note, tricky me has taken Friday and Tuesday off.  5 for the price of 2.  Look for me on the golf course, by the pool, or at the skate park!  Whoo hoo!    "

187,Aquarius,"        LIFE FOR RENT   everyone's all cd reviewing so i thought i'd jump the bandwagon and tell you about DIDO's new cd 'Life for Rent.' maybe you think someone who's obsessed with *NSYNC and loves to sing and dance around to the bubble sound that is pop music couldn't possibly be interested in listening to someone as mellow as Dido. well, i heard her NO ANGEL cd and i must say that after that i was just drawn to her melancholy, whisper of a singing voice. that's one reason i love listening to norah jones' cd, but that's another entry.   anyhow, there's one song on Dido's cd that really got to me. it's the title track, 'life for rent.' just take a glance at the lyrics and tell me it doesn't make you think:   life for rent    i haven't ever really found a place that i call home i never stick around quite long enough to make it i apologize that once again i'm not in love but it's not as if i mind that your heart ain't exactly breaking it's just a thought, only a thought    but if my life is for rent and i don't learn to buy well i deserve nothing more than i get cos nothing i have is truly mine    i've always thought that i would love to live by the sea to travel the world alone and live more simply i have no idea what's happened to that dream coz there's really nothing left here to stop me it's just a thought, only a thought    but if my life is for rent and i don't learn to buy well i deserve nothing more than i get cos nothing i have is truly mine    while my heart is a shield and i won't let it down while i am so afraid to fail so i won't even try well how can i say i'm alive    but if my life is for rent and i don't learn to buy well i deserve nothing more than i get cos nothing i have is truly mine   this song could have a hundred different interpretations. but here's what it is to me. if you ever happen to wonder what the meaning of life is for you, and you can't, for whatever reason, figure out what that is. ask yourself about the last time you took a chance on an opportunity. did you seize the day or just tell yourself you were gonna fail at it anyway so why bother trying? how about the last time you asked yourself why you're alone. have you passed up chances to meet people because you're scared they won't think much of you? ever forbade yourself from feeling any kind of romantic feelings for someone because you can't remember the last time that emotion didn't fail to hurt you?   well, here it is folks. life is about taking chances, taking initiative. when i was younger i felt like this came naturally to me. teachers and bosses called me a 'self-starter.' but i know that for a lot of us, life seemed to slow down and the ability to 'self-start' became harder and harder to maintain. i know my starter was cold for the last 3 years, but i feel like it's coming back to me. and not because i waited for it to warm up again, but because  I   decided put the heat back into it  MYSELF . i don't want my life to be for rent, not having invested any kind of genuine risk in a venture. i don't wanna look back at my twenties when i'm 60 (god-willing i live that long) and say my life was a wasteland of missed chances. i've been reminded time and again in the last year that there is no courage without fear and there is certainly no victory without trial.

190,Capricorn,"           Charley is currently in Jamaica, and from about 8:00 tonight until 12:00 tomorrow it will be terrorizing the Cayman Islands.  My family is there and I just read some news about hurricane warnings.  Everytime there is a storm there, alot of people leave the island.    A little insight into the Cayman Islands...  The island itself is about 20km by 10 km and the highest point on the island is only about 20ft above sea level.  The island is basically an overgrown coral reef that was exposed when sea levels dropped a thousand years ago (whatever).   So as you can imagine, any significant storm that hit directly would pretty much wipe out the entire island.  A little insight into my family...  A few years ago when hurricane mitch (class 4 out of 5) (5 being 'the perfect storm' type of storm) came through the carribbean most of the people left the island.  My mother got in to a truck and drove around the island taking pictures (one of which was shown in national geographic.)  Orignially, the hurricane was on a path for the island, but ended up veering towards honduras so they only got hit at about 75% strength.  Otherwise there would be no cayman islands, and those swiss bankers would be very happy.  Charley is currently a category 1 hurricane (the weakest of the 5 ratings) so im not too worried about them despite some island hurricane warnings.  Anyways, you can see the storm at:   urlLink http://weather.yahoo.com/img/carib_websattropir_440_mdy_y.html  ,  Grand Cayman is that little black dot between Cuba and Jamaica.           "
191,Sagittarius,"        Everything new!  First of all, this is my first entry with the new Blogger look.  Love it!  Second new thing is  urlLink my new car .  After the driver side window wouldn't go up on Thursday, I decided it really was finally time to get a new car.  I've been putting it off and putting it off, and the window was the last straw.  I'd been doing my 'don't rain' dance for three days, since the window wouldn't go up.  On Sunday, I walked into a dealership that had contacted me on an internet query.  I was going to get something else, but I got such a good deal on this car instead, so I took it.   I think Fred will like it ~ in fact I know he would.  When you turn the headlights at night, the floorboards light up inside the car a lovely neon blue.  And the cupholders change colors from red to green, yellow to blue.  I have a disco in my car at night.  My little divas love it!  Diva out.           "
192,Scorpio,"              Breathe again  I remember a shpiel I put up awhile back, which speaks infinite volumes about what I feel right now. It's my first shpiel in fact.  So now, once again, please rise for the encore performance of  Threat    This was it. She had no place to run, to hide. From beneath the folds of his trousers he produced his weapon, a shiny object that glinted and reflected the singular beam of light streaming through the window and THREATened her with it. Backed up against the wall, she had no choice but give in. She raised her hand as he slipped the object onto her finger, and accepted his marriage proposal...

193,Cancer,"           A lot of people believe that an employer’s decision on  hiring a candidate depends on just skills and experience.  Well they couldn’t be farther from the truth because that is  false.    Here is the truth…      Skills and experience within your profession aren’t what  gets candidates the job. The truth is that there are too  many candidates with the proper skills and experience to get  the job, and ONLY one usually gets the job.       Companies are looking for more than skills and  experience these days. So it’s extremely important that you  all your individual characteristics mirror your passion.    So what are the other factors that are usually invisible to  candidates?   **Self-Awareness** – who are you and where are you going?  What are your plans for the present and the future? How do  you know what you want? How do you know that you’re right  for this job? Employers want to make sure that you’re not  lost.   **Learning Skills** – Are you willing to learn? Are you  current on trends and technology? Are you a person who loves  to “grow” within their profession? You want to show an  employer that you’re a candidate that learns in order to  progress your career.    **Adaptability** - With everything changing so rapidly  today, it’s possible that tomorrow your skills may no longer  be relevant. Are you a person who adapts well to change?   **Character** - Do you show passion in your industry,  because when you do, it projects through your résumé, cover  letter, and especially during the interview. An employer  wants a dependable trustworthy employee. The more you  project your positive character, the better!        You can have a huge advantage over your competition by  going one step. Create a career portfolio and within it make  sure that you showcase all the categories above in the  proper manner. I guarantee that this will give you a major  edge over your competition.        So you see that it’s not all about skills and  experience. It’s really important that you consider the  factors above, because them alone can get you the job.     =========================================================== David Green is an author and hiring manager of Distinguish  Marketing, LLC.

195,Capricorn,"           Well, I just got back from a speech and meet & greet session with Barack Obama, candidate for Illinois' seat in the US Senate. He's absolutely amazing, and he's taking the American political world by storm. He was virtually unheard of when he won the Illinois primary in March (this basically means that he was chosen as the person whose name goes on the ballot on the Democrat side), but he still beat the other 6 candidates by over 30 percentage points. Then he was asked to deliver a speech at the Democratic National Convention last week in Boston, and man did he deliver (speech available for free on iTunes, along with all of the other speeches). He had the US abuzz for several days, and then I found out while at the pub last night that he was speaking at my uni this morning at 8 in a very intimate setting. I got up early and went, and I was not disappointed. He's witty, well-spoken, and represents the America we aspire to be yet often come up short of. His father is from Kenya, his mother is from Kansas and he grew up on the south side of Chicago, and for those of you not from the US, just take my word that that's not your everyday combination.  He rose from a 'dodgy' neighborhood to attend Harvard Law, and he now teaches constitutional law at the University of Chicago, one of the top 5 law schools in the US. He's black, he's white, he's educated, he's working class and he's white collar. Many are predicting that the Democratic party is just priming him for the presidential nomination in 2012. It's about time we had an immigrant president, a black president, a president from Chicago (not Texas)! Sorry to write so much about American politics here, but Ulli loves it. I know you guys have probably never heard of Barack Obama, but you will.  A Democrat from Illinois when meeting with President Bush a little over a year ago had to explain (speaking very sloooowly and cleeeearly) that the button she was wearing said 'Obama' and not 'Osama,' to which Bush replied, 'I've never heard of him.' She quickly advised him, 'You will, Mr. President, you will.'  Sidenote: A woman in my hometown, the wife of a policeman, currently has 2 kids under age 7, and is expecting quintuplets. Her husband is about to ship out to the war in Iraq, a war we shouldn't have been in in the first place. It's families just like these all over the US that are suffering for George W. Bush's mistakes.  (This message has been sponsored by the frustrated ravings of Tim French, and is in no way affiliated with the Democratic Party)  Tim          "
196,Gemini,"       The undertoad is strong today. That irrepressible feeling that something bad is going to happen. Nothing bad may happen. I may be fine today. It may be yet another day, full of banter and nostalgia, but it could be painful and scarring at the same time. I cannot get out of my head today. All I want to do is sleep, but I am stuck in the middle of a traffic jam on 95. I wonder, if I napped right now, would anyone notice?  &nbsp;  I write sonnets in my head as the radio blares. Who cares about being springtime fresh? The rain comes pouring down, stranding me behind an 18 wheeler that takes up 4 lanes. I want to cry.  &nbsp; I want to shed tears for the woman I am, and the child I was. I want to have a home of my own, a career of my own, a life of my own, and I am sick of the protocol that is set up, that I must follow to get there. Why must I follow the rules? Why can't I be exempt? Why won't the headaches stop?  &nbsp; Why must everything be in triplicate, and typed, and double spaced? I wish just once I could stop the pain...that creeps into every decision I make...every part of my being...everything I create. Everyone judges me, and expects me to judge them in return. I am tired of judging...can't I just enter for the fun of it?  &nbsp; I hurt, am tired and hate my life....I thought it was supposed to get easier as we got older? Why does it just get harder? Why doesn't trying our best count for anything anymore?           "
197,Pisces,"   so this man who writes this blog thinks american soldiers are heroes?  when they come home in a box and their mommies and daddies cry and and they have a big funeral their president doesn't attend?    i won't be throwing out that image of paul johnson.  the severed head will burn in my head as a symbol of the consequences of wanton murder and thievery, as it should for every american.  i came to the united states in 1998, to study religious studies on full scholarship at ucla.  i spoke not a word of english, and the americans looked down at me like i was their pet dog, running for a stupid stick in the park.  if you don't understand what song the stupid girl on american idol sings, they hate you.    after 9/11 i was persecuted for the color of my skin.  they didn't like brown folks.  i was held by homeland security when my phone records were traced to iraq.  they did full body cavity search.  and you americans think pain is rinsing your mouth too long with the listerine.    you heard it right.  i was born in iraq.  my parents still live there.  they'd love to join in this blog, but they've never used a computer.  i only lived in iraq until i was nine.  then i went to live with an uncle in england.  one brother came with me, two other brothers stayed in iraq.  they were killed by u.s. troops in this past year's fighting.  but i had not spoken to either of them in 17 years so it wasn't a crushing thing.  i did not stay in bed for 6 months and cry like a little baby and make people feel sorry for me like americans do when someone dies.  i only tracked my parents again in 1999.  i talk to them about monthly.  my father owned a store before the occupation.  now he has nothing.    was that so bad, blaine?  you were so afraid of a few empty threats...like americans who hide in their basements when they here the 2000 bug will destroy them.  i knew you would soil yourself at the mere thought of iraqi redemption.  but i am benevolent, not the opposite.  i live in los angeles and i lead a simple life, selling computer hardware. if blaine allows, and you all want, i will tell more.

198,Capricorn,"           actually you would be better off reading one of the other post, not a whole lot to say.&nbsp; i am not relishing the thought of getting up at 5:44 tomorrow morning after about 3 weeks of sleeping in every morning.&nbsp; plus there are supposed to be thunderstorms, which according to my dad are incredibly deadly.&nbsp; if i get struck by lightning i would rather it be on a golf course.&nbsp; anyway, i like playing in the rain.&nbsp; i guess it makes me feel tougher than most other golfers (shut up, golfers are among the toughest people out there...sometimes we go 5 or 6 holes w/out a cart girl :) .&nbsp; seriously, though, i get a sense of pride and dedication when i play in a downpour, plus it is a change from the usual scorchiness.)  urlLink i have a link to a website i found today that i guess is sweeping the nation here. &nbsp; its jibjab.com or something.&nbsp; its basically making fun of kerry and bush, which gives it a wider&nbsp;appeal.&nbsp; quite funny imo, although its already gotten a little old.&nbsp; i would limit viewings to 5 or fewer personally.&nbsp; it has a little profanity, but that never killed anyone (i hope not at least). one other thing: is it even debatable that seinfeld is the best show ever on tv? it is the only show where i can still crack up even if ive seen it 3 or 4 times before (yes i just watched it on tbs: bless you ted turner...wow i never thought i would say that...please keep the reruns on forever!) i have to go to bed so early tonight its not funny.&nbsp; goodnight!

199,Gemini,"       I shouldn't have done it, but I did. For some reason, there was some serious gravitational pull to the email folder archive today. Call me a masochist. We all have these folders in our email accounts. Or at least I do. Maybe normal people delete them after a while. I guess I hold on to them for the nostalgia. Or in Dan's case, to analyze every word and try to figure out what went wrong.   I know, I know. It really wasn't about me. He just wasn't ready for any kind of relationship. As much as I would like to believe that, the truth was he just wasn't ready for a relationship...with me. How did it go from,  'I had a great time yet again with you yesterday.  While we have been to some pretty decent places on our dates so far, something tells me it's you and not what we actually do or where we go that makes our time together so worthwhile!' to ' I sincerely hope we can continue on as friends...I'm just truly unsure of what I want for myself'?  Since he 'sincerely' managed to stop being friends with me, I should write him off as an asshole. For leading me on and being a coward and not really telling me the truth about not wanting to continue into a relationship. If it was just a matter of him not being ready, I  could respect that. I just know that wasn't the real reason. I'll get over him. My heart still feels like it's in a million pieces still. I'm so tired of putting all the pieces back together though. I just feel like sweeping them under the rug.   I know I shouldn't be wasting any heartache over him. I know I need to move on. I know I'm worth more than he'll ever know and that I deserve better. Seriously, Lindsay. Get over it. This is just how I'm feeling and I can't do anything about it except write into oblivion. How can I channel this depression into some brilliant idea that will reap me millions of dollars and the ability to go up to Dan and say 'neener. neener. neener'?  hmmmm... I already feel a little better.         "

202,Cancer,"       Enjoyed myself last night at the Esplanade: Theatres by the Bay.  It was so damn crowded last night, and I have no idea how crowded could I describe it. Perhaps crowded enough to convert a plant-like me into a strong diamond-like me texture. There was also a group of boys whom were so absolutely SMELLY...and I couldn't take it! Nearly choked & suffered from asphxia in the train due south to City Hall station. Nevertheless, I enjoyed myself at the Esplanade with my friends...quite an interesting day.  Hehe...we were nearly driven out of the 5566 concert since we left of our own accord. Now I understand why concerts should not have free admission; it'll cause a mob to form and big enough to form the  sans-culottes  of 1789. (Yes...the French again~! O_O La Diana est la Francaise!)  Enjoying myself on Friendster again...with that irritating smiley face which should be replaced with a sad face known as Foester instead. In this way, we can enjoy BITCHING better right? Imagine so many people bitching around by writing bitchy testimonials, which makes it similar to a virtual version of Mean Girls. SO BITCHY of me~~~=D [Hehe...I sound like some slut~~]  Friends is so funny....especially this episode where they learn French. I'm not amazed that Matt LeBlanc can be so expressive in French...he's a French-American, noting the 'Le' in his surname~~=) [He's quite hot too...!

203,Libra,"           Christianity is the dominant religion in PNG.  Unless you come here though you don't fully realise how successful the missionaries have been in converting the 'savages'.  Coming from a secular society like Australia where religion has more or less taken a back seat to everyday life, I have found it is interesting to see a society that is quite the opposite.  Everyone seems to be from a particular denomination (with some obscure ones in thrown in) and you learn early, if you are inclined like me, to either tell everyone you are an atheist/agnostic/Buddhist etc or pick a denomination that is not represented locally.  This is wise advise as you will find within the first few weeks plenty of people who will inquire as to what church you belong to.    Whether you agree with the what the missionaries have done or not, one thing that is certain is it has certainly changed the lives of the average Papua New Guinean.  Church life has now become a fantastic social event for the people.  It gives them something to do, it allows them to sing and they get to mix with their friends.  Perhaps the reason churches have been so popular here, and the missionaries so successful is that they so allow for social activity, something that previously was limited to the odd sing-sing once every blue moon.  It is amazing to see how many different denominations have taken root here.  If you look at the history of colonisation it is not hard to realise why.  Papua New Guinea has been on the world map longer than Australia has, and the coastal people have had contact with the outside world for centuries.  It was commonly thought (for some reason) by the early 20 century colonists that the interior of PNG did not contain much in the way of human habitation.  Hence the shock that was to be had by both the locals and the explorers when in the 1930's white man first ventured into the highlands and discovered twice as many people there than were on the coast.  By the 1930's the industrial age was well and truly in swing, so information about the multitudes of heathens needed 'saving' went far and wide and quickly.  After the war the race was on by all the missionary Christian groups of the world to 'save' these multitudes from their heathen ways.  So now you have the bizarre situation in a town like Goroka with a population of around 25,000, having 43 denominations represented.  Unfortunately from a secular point of view living in PNG does have it disadvantages, though nothing that can't be put up with.  These seem to be mainly the incessant bombardment of religious tenets.   It ranges from the ever present street side preachers, gospel music at the supermarket, people asking you to come to their church and the constant e-mails that are sent around via the universities e-mail system.  The Uni All Staff distribution list has more or less been taken over for purposes apart from University work.  People use it as a soap-box to preach their gospel, invitations to join their crusade (not sure what happens there, though it brings visions of men in armour with St. George crosses) or come to a lotu (pray meeting), warnings of some new devil like technology that everyone should be wary of, showing times for 'The passion of the Christ' at the campus Christian centre and this weeks TV schedule for the Hope channel.  It gets a bit much at times.  The culture in other respects though has grounding very much in the past.  It is funny to think that a simple thing like a mother breast-feeding her child in public is frowned upon in supposed liberal countries like Australia or the UK (though with Howard in office prehaps I should rephrase that), but here in what you would assume to be a more conservative country it is not uncommon to see mothers with one breast poking out of there top suckling a little one.  One image that I don't think I will forget in the near future was while buying bananas at a market.  The woman selling the produce was wandering around showing me the best bananas, while all the time having a wide eyed child attached.  I am not sure who had the biggest cultural shock the kid seeing the whitefella or me doing business with a breast-feeding mother.  In western culture seeing two men holding hands and walking together, it would be safe to assume that the pair were gay.  Now as I said before PNG is a very conservative country due to the influence of the churches, which is why seeing men holding hands here seem bizarre.  But the holding hands act is quite a common occurrence.  It does not mean the men are gay, but most likely just good friends.  It seems that the stigma associated with that act in western cultures has not transgressed to PNG life, and the act is still a throw back to a part of their pre-colonial culture.  The act of taking another mans hand takes place all the time.  If you happen to meet a friend while walking, you will always shake his hand before having a conversation.  From my upbringing it was usually the case of only shaking hands upon the first meeting of someone, or if you have not seen them for a long time.  Oddly enough though physical contact is usually only done between same sex groups.  Acts of male-female contact is rarely if ever seen in public.  In fact the entire relationship between men and women is very different to western culture.  It is not uncommon for a husband and wife to live in completely separate towns and only see each other occasionally.  This is what my boss does.  It seems they make up for lost time when they do get together as approximately 50% of the population is under 20 years of age.  Living seperate lives does not mean that they are not good parents.  Fathers dote over their children just as much as mothers do, they just may see less of them.          "
204,Taurus,"                 I just put on a pair of jeans that I haven't worn in months because they didn't fit...and guess what? THEY FIT!! :) In fact, they're even a little loose!      "
205,Aquarius,"                 I must say that I am quite proud of myself!! I just added a couple new sections to the left of my blog - adding links to other blogs I like, and books I'm reading! I figured out how to code all this new stuff in all by myself! I didn't even have to ask Ked to help me. Of course if I had royally screwed it up I would have yelled 'Keeeeeeeeeeeeedddd!!' =)   I've made a commitment to read 24 books this year. It may be a little ambitious, but hey, shoot for the stars and if you hit the moon you've still made progress! I've finished two so far and I'm cooking on the third. I remember those lazy summer days as I kid when I would just read and read and read. That's probably why I had to get glasses in second grade and my eyes are so bad now! When I first got my glasses the eye doctor told my Mom to tell me to go outside more often. My Mom said 'she does, she sits outside and reads!' I'd read on the porch, in the tree (and spy on the neighbor boys while peering over my book!) and late at night in my bed with a flashlight! I just couldn't get enough. I'd see how many times I could finish the library reading program in the summer, cooking through it at least twice if not three times. Somewhere during high school and adulthood some of the joy of reading was lost. Maybe it was the Business Law book that I just couldn't stay awake through, maybe it was Statistics or just the fact that I was being forced to read. But I just didn't enjoy it as much. And then, when I did enjoy it, I felt guilty for sitting curled up under a blanket for hours on end with a book I just couldn't put down. Part of me said, 'read, read faster and just get through it! You can't stop now!' And two hours later the laundry still needed folded, the dishes were in a pile, and the dirty bathrooms calling my name. Maybe reading wasn't as pleasurable because in the back of my mind there was always something else to do. I remember a comment one of my professors in college made my freshman year. He said, 'whether or not you finish college, keep reading. As long as you are reading you'll continue learning and growing.' So I've decided to recapture that joy of reading this year. Now that I'm finally done with school maybe I can appreciate it more. Yes, there will always be the responsibilities calling my name, but a half hour, an hour, or occasionally that sweet dessert of a few hours, won't hurt.  As for now, my bed is calling my name. Actually, Ked is calling my name first. He's asking, 'What's a chord?' as he strums on the guitar we inherited from my Dad. Ked is a singer, musician, and rockstar at heart. He wants so badly to learn to play the guitar this year. He found some internet site tonight, and learned 2 chords, but he doesn't know what a chord is. He's telling me, 'this is E, and this is C.' But the guitar is so out of tune they sound the same!! Needless to say, he's strumming away on C and E, well we think anyway. I suppose that's better than just randomly strumming away imagining he's a star like he used to do. Let's see if I can remember enough of my music training to teach him how to read music and what a chord is. Oh, if this blog only had audio, you would truly enjoy this bed time concert!! He's got the Johnny Cash look down, wearing all black tonight. Let's hope the talent follows!  ROCK ON KED!!               "

208,Aries,"           Hey all.  Julie was admitted to the hospital yesterday.  We went in for a routine check, and the doctor saw something she did not like and sent Julie down for observation.  Come to find out, she was having contractions and did not even notice them.  She is only 26 weeks, so no one wants to see these babies born yet.  They gave Julie some medicine that did not stop the contractions.  They then tried a different, stronger, medicine, and it did not work either.  By 5 o'clock, her very reserved doctor, was visibly concerned about the situation.  Finally, around 7, the contractions slowed. and have, as of an hour ago, stopped.  Julie will be in the hospital through at least tomorrow, depending on how she reacts to being weened off the medication.  After that though, she will be on mandatory bedrest.  So, that means my availability for any of the group stuff (Road to Glory, dinner parties, movies) are highly suspect for the immediate future.  I will let you know what changes.         "

Yes I think I've matured, but I'm still lost and confused like I was then, if not more. I still don't know what I want from myself or from otherwise, I'm still stuck.  It's weird how much you can change though in a year but then still fill like you ended where you started. With certain situations, that's how I feel. Sure there was a break through for a couple months or whatever, but then I got shot down again. I don't know how to make sense of anything or my life right now, I don't know. I feel like I contradict everythign I say too. I don't know maybe you should figure out if I have really changed, read through my blogs and you'll see.   All I know is taht you can see my change in attitude, from the bad to the good to the great to the bad again, my feelings are where I started too. It just hurts to see how happy I was and how I'm not there right now, it sucks. But don't worry, I am happy : ).  k         "

I.e. if we speak a lil' like 'em, they'll understand us a whole lot betta.  Case in point: A couple of weeks ago I was checking around for prices for belly-piercing - Bel wanted to give it a go, so I was sourcing for the costs. Ended up calling this guy, who turned out to be a pharmacist who did all sorta piercings for pple, along with his wife who was a doctor (hygiene!). I rang up, and somehow ended up with a twang as I spoke. This usually pops up when I'm a lil' nervous too - lapsing into my Valley girl mode.   Hi, I'm just wondering if you guys like, do belly-piercing?    Yep, we sure do.     Oh, how much does it cah-st?    Well, it's $75, but it's pretty cheap. You sound like you're from America.   Momentararily caught off-guard, I said the first thing that popped into my head to explain the accent.   Uh, yeah, I am.    Oh, which part?    Sawrry?    I mean where are you from?    Erm, America?

I've never gone to a movie by myself. But I think I enjoyed the movie more and was able to concentrate on it and get more out of it because I was by myself. I had a conversation with a friend a few months back who was telling me that he  only  goes to the movies by himself. He pointed out that when you're in a movie with someone else, it's more difficult to keep up with the story line because the person you're with has a tendency to talk to you all the time. Whereas by yourself, the only real distraction is the movie (and where this one was concerned, the subtitles). So, would I do it again? YES, definitely!

James Kim showed me a cool site. www.tekzoned.com Go there and do all the fun things on the site. So failed that one.       "
234,Pisces,"       Given my post yesterday, this email update from Nicole Poston, a woman in my church, (who is studying spanish in Honduras) caught my attention.  She's talking about her teacher:    He teaches me Honderenismos like the phrase you say when you are about to sneeze and then you don’t. De lo arrenpentidos esta lleno el Reino de los Ceilos. The Kingdom of Heaven is full of repenters already.  The idea is that when you sneeze you are repenting,  so when you don’t sneeze people say this to mean, don’t worry too much, there are enough repenters already there.   sneezing / repenting?      "

237,Leo,"             Yay!! We're going to see fireworks at City Park, tonight. I hope it's not gonna rain again tonight, because it's kinda cloudy right now. But it's alright, it will be fun..fun..fun!! Finally, today's my first day off after working like crazy for the past two weeks. This morning I got a chance to have a cup of Starbucks' breakfast blend coffee with two slices of bread with chocolate sprinkles. Yumm!! And finally, I got a chance to go to sleep last night without having to set my alarm. I spent my morning by just sitting around in front of my computer, browsing, waiting for my bid at ebay to end, and chatting with  urlLink Mur  who's still having fun in Jakarta!! I 'envy' you!! I also talked to A-lie, one of my bestfriends since forever, on the phone today. It felt good to talk to her again. Actually, we laughed more than we talked!! I think the only people who can understand our jokes are us. We often lost touch, but we're still very good friends!! We talked about lots of things and came up with why people always ask sensitive questions to others such as virginity and sex. Those are like  'pertanyaan-pertanyaan yang kurang penting untuk dibahas ke orang lain.'  Those are like something that..I think we should just keep to ourselves. Like in Friendster for example, lots of those bulletin boards questions are about these subjects. And of course, no one will really be honest about their answers. It's just dumb!   Anyway, I'm thinking of moving to DC, which is where she lives right now, after I graduate, to apply for that broadcasting job that we're talking about. It sounds like a fun job, and it will be a great experience for me if I want to get a similar job back home. We'll see. I still have a year to go anyway.    My weekend? So far so good. Me and some friends went to see Spiderman 2  on Friday. It was good!! I like it better than the first one. Yesterday, I had to wake up early at 6 A.M. to work (yes..I work on weekends) and spent my afternoon with friends. We went to Whole Foods Market, a new organic store in town. It was really crowded inside the store and everything was so expensive!! After that, we had some Japanese food in downtown for dinner. As usual, me and Puma ended up at my place, watching the Food network channel. It was an okay night.  How's your weekend?            "
238,Aries,           Mir - In my opinion yes one can sacrifice one's mood for the happiness of another. However if one is always having to do this then that relationship is not really a happy one. There has to be some time for oneself for their happiness. In thoses time someone else mood may have to be sacrificed for the happiness to come about.          
239,Libra,"                 My new favorite thing to do is pull up at a light next to a car, turn up really loud music, like System of a Down, or Linkin Park, and make like I'm dancing to Shiney Happy People.  People look at you so strangely.             "
240,Capricorn,"       This topic is bound to come up eventually, so we might as well get it out of the way now. &nbsp; What is your favourite kinds of music at this moment? &nbsp; How about this,&nbsp; Favourite Type of Music, Favourite Band(s), Favourite Song.&nbsp; Note: They don't have to be the same. &nbsp; For me, it would be:&nbsp; Classic Rock, Aerosmith, Dust in the Wind(Kansas)     "
241,Gemini,"       The body is real but fake as a mere player wanting what it will never be the golden calf is intimidating  his clothes and jewels are much too fine for she wants to be his muse a puppet with strings, she is  wanting to venture for a new (yet old) emotion cutting her restraints with waterfalls  secretly wanting an old emotion a void filled with control and acquiescence that she loves... fill the void.              "
242,Taurus,"                   This post is dedicated to all you troubled teens. Going out with people is supposed to be fun NOT mushy gushy serious weird stuff. So heres my theory which a friend helped my write:        &nbsp;   What people now days call 'going out' means that you claim eachother and are temporarily stuck to somebody for usually a long period of time in which u probally decide you don't even like this person BUT you don't want to break things off because it would be too much of a mess. So going out is basically a pointless, rather stupid thing that ends in a mess. Dating, however, is so much better! When you date, you're not really making a commitment you're just having fun. And then if you decide you don't like the person then you just don't answer their calls and you move on! Man I give good advice!       &nbsp;     &nbsp;   On the dating subject- as I was goin to bed last night I was thinking about what kinda guy would be right for me and i came up with a list of some things i like in a guy and some things&nbsp;I don't like! So here it is:       &nbsp;   Top 5 things I like in a guy       &nbsp;   1.Funny! I'm a happy person I like to laugh!     2.Respectful to parents and to me     3.Christian or just an all around good guy     4.Nice hair and pretty eyes- oh and they hafta smell good!     5. and a country boy preferably or an austrailian accent!       &nbsp;   oo ok when u comment gimme your list of things u like in a girl or guy!

245,Pisces,"       the comment was made that it would be a waste for me to abandon this blog.&nbsp; that's true, it is.&nbsp; it's been a good source for defending myself.&nbsp; but apparently it is taken so seriously by some people that they chose to get in their car, drive to lowe's, and interrupt dan while he's working to find out if he's okay.&nbsp; guys, dan chooses not to get involved with this blog nonsense for a reason.&nbsp; &nbsp;he can take care of himself.&nbsp; that's the reason that, if i do choose to post, they will be either impersonal or few and far between.  today is also my last day in my apartment.&nbsp; the reason makes me sad, but i won't discuss it here out of respect (and yes, i do respect you in that aspect) for the other person involved.  there are a few things i want to say before i sign off for awhile.....  danielle smith--i know you got back from france today.&nbsp; i hope you had a good time and that you and ray were able to work some things out.&nbsp; i'm happy right now and i honestly hope that you are too.&nbsp; i have chosen to create this blog in order to make sure both sides of the 'break-up story' were told.&nbsp; it was not created to lash out at anyone, including you.&nbsp; i've learned a very valuable lesson in the last couple of weeks....sometimes you have to let things go.&nbsp; i understand that you might have an opinion as to what is happening on these blogs.&nbsp; you know my email address and eric's if you have a comment.&nbsp; you and i have had our share of fights this year.&nbsp; we both know that i have never made a comment on your blog or ray's....or said anything spiteful or hateful about you on a blog anywhere else.&nbsp; we also both know that i have never responded on the blogs to anything that you have said about me.&nbsp; i'm politely asking you to do the same for me now.&nbsp; we've all been through enough.  dani darling--i just wanted you to know that i never once discouraged eric from being your friend.&nbsp; he will tell you that himself.&nbsp; he showed me the blogs that you wrote and the emails that you sent him and i asked him for months to tell you that he had a serious girlfriend.&nbsp; his reasoning was that you were not ready.&nbsp; i know you don't like me and yes, i have gotten mad when i read blogs that you wrote and it seemed like you were heaping alot of blame on eric, because he was telling me that you were always just a friend and that he hadn't even seen you in almost four years.&nbsp; i do understand that eric didn't speak to you for a long time while he and i were together.&nbsp; his refusal to tell you (and another girl that claimed to be in love with him) about our relationship made me insecure with our relationship.&nbsp; but i think that he may have thought that i was insecure with you.&nbsp; even though that wasn't the case, that might have been the misunderstanding.&nbsp; i know you just emailed eric recently telling him how you had felt about him.&nbsp; i hope that you will continue to be his friend and support him, because he really needs that right now.&nbsp; i've tried for three months to be his friend and encourage him....but i'm beginning to realize that my presence, whether in person or written, hurts him more, and i don't want that for him.&nbsp; this blog had not been intended to persuade people to choose sides.&nbsp; i was simply tired of my name and dan's being dragged through the mud and one side of the story being told.&nbsp; like eric said, quite fairly, this is my right, and i'm glad that he chose to link the spot to his so everyone could see it.&nbsp; but i am sorry that you had to hurt.&nbsp;   melanie--what can i say?&nbsp; God must have had a sense of humor when he made us sisters.&nbsp; thank you for your support for me, and dan, and eric.&nbsp; take care of scotti.&nbsp; we would be lost without him, too.  dan--you already know.&nbsp; much love.  eric--i'm sorry that i've made choices that hurt you.&nbsp; as far as my relationship with dan goes, the only thing i can apologize for is replacing you as soon as i did.&nbsp; you say that i should be sorry for ever beginning a relationship with him in the first place.&nbsp; you will never hear an apology for that one.&nbsp; you ask me not to lie to you.&nbsp; i did once, i'm not going to do it again.&nbsp; i will not apologize for something i am not sorry for.&nbsp; but i am sorry that you're making the choices that you are.&nbsp; you claim to love me and then tell me that you're going to kill yourself so that the blame will rest on my shoulders.&nbsp; i don't understand how that is love, and you're only making things worse for yourself.&nbsp; for the last three months you have had countless friends and family be there any time you need them and do their best to help you.&nbsp; you've chosen to ignore them.&nbsp; you claim to be open to other's opinions, but your retaliation to scotti's comments prove otherwise.&nbsp; you blame me for destroying your life, and then claim to be a christian and that you trust God.&nbsp; i just don't understand.&nbsp; but when i ask you these questions and you can't defend yourself with a good excuse, you try to turn things back around and point fingers at me.&nbsp; you keep telling me to destroy you....to say whatever i can to hurt you.&nbsp; i&nbsp;can't do that.&nbsp; there is enough hurt.&nbsp; i do love you and miss you as a friend.&nbsp; i wish things hadn't ended like this.&nbsp; but you can never say that i haven't been here whenever&nbsp;you needed me for the last three months, even though it&nbsp;hurt&nbsp;someone&nbsp;else that loves me, too.&nbsp; but i guess that means nothing.&nbsp; my one regret right now is that i've hurt dan for nothing.&nbsp; i've hurt him, hurt you, and hurt myself.&nbsp; so what&nbsp;was the point?  well, it's time to go now.&nbsp; i have to get my little sister/therapist/stylist off to work....even though she was up very late talking to eric (who once again&nbsp;showed zero tolerance to a different opinion).&nbsp; it's been a long night, and i have to start packing.  c'est la vie.&nbsp; praying for all that were mentioned, whether they believe it or not.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;          "
246,Scorpio,"              Grandma  I was suddenly reminded of my grandma. Of the fraility of life. Of the lossness of memory, of being a prisoner of self, of the fading distance between the conscious mind and the unconscious one. The reminder served to halt all trains of thought and brought great, sobbing tears to my eyes. Will I see her when I return in December? Will she live long enough to celebrate my impending marriage? Will she be there, waiting on the front porch, smiling through the haze of her cloudy vision?  I wrote this in response, to that reminder:  'I'm crying at work. Sobbing in fact. Mostly due to the feeling of abject horror and loss, a total and overwhelming sense of helplessness, and guilt. Oh the guilt. That I can't even give her a hug when I most want to, that she has totally recessed from my conscious mind, only to turn up as a blip in my radar when her name is mentioned.  But yet I understand the passage of life, the frailty and fruitlessness of the achievements made in decades past, fading as distant drops in the misty horizon. Which is why I'm reminded once again, that I cannot live it the way most do, climbing, clawing, attaining and ultimately losing, everything. And I'm cheered, and conforted, by the fact that she's as much an eternal being as me and you; her body and mind will disappear, but her soul, bouyed by her faith and belief in her Saviour, will never cease to exist.'  To the person who reminded me, I hope you understand, too. Not because I seem to know the answer, and that this is the only answer, but it's my source of comfort and strength.  He  is. And will be.            "
247,Pisces,       ...  2 things i hate  (besides drop ceilings): ...  1. people who have an external locus of control all the time.  2. people who are always talking about how busy they are.  so i think i could stop hating myself if everyone would just stop with the:   'how are you?'  it's not my fault i'm so honest.  ....

249,Aquarius,"       For week’s I have been wondering when exactly Father’s Day is.  I know of course, that it’s in June and on a Sunday.  But I feel like it moves around from year to year.  I have, however, just learned that it’s always the 3rd Sunday of June each year.  Hmm, I really have trouble with dates.  I’m horrible at birthdays.  Actually, horrible is probably not strong enough a word.  My best friend and I will often send birthday cards that are 6 months late.  But, we know that’s the way it is and we accept it, wholeheartedly.  Others, however, are not so kind.  I’ve known people to really get offended by others forgetting their birthdays.  That’s just damn selfish in my opinion.  I don’t know.  I’m not a big birthday celebrator and never really have been.  I’m trying to get better at it, but dates elude me.  Like today, I was reading my daily blogs when   urlLink Jennifer Weiner’s post  mention’s father’s day and I have one of those “Oh my God, I’ve got to call my Dad” moments.  I ran around looking for my cell phone and as I’m talking to my Dad I realize that I have not sent a card or anything.  I quickly realize I will try to remedy the situation next week at family beach week, but still shitty, shitty of me.  I sent my Mom a Mom’s day card (a day late of course), but nothing for my old Dad, who loves me so unconditionally.  Sorry Dad.  It’s not personal, I just suck.  Well, I guess in my case, we’ve established why there is no Daughter’s Day.  On the bright side, maybe the Father’s Day cards will be half-price tomorrow.         "

255,Capricorn,"           just got back from driving my neighbor back from the airport (i run a taxi company in my spare time...).  there was a bad accident on 270 east just west of 71.  there was a semi overturned on the side, and there was a pickup w/ a boat on back in the road w/ its front end completely smashed.  they had to block off 2 or 3 lanes of 270 which just left 3 open.  it was pretty congested.  i think i cut about 5 or 6 people off to get through all of the traffic, but i had to get to the airport in time (i ended up having about 15 minutes to spare).  so im kind of wondering if everybody involved is ok or not.  there were a bunch of cops plus a crane there, but i didnt see an ambulance, which either means it had already come or nobody was hurt.  i can probably update you on this tomorrow.  it was kind of sobering to see after i was getting very frustrated with traffic before i knew what happened.  i guess tomorrow is never guaranteed.  now im getting philosophical here...there now im over it :) .  im going to go watch last comic standing now.  that show is kind of dumb, but i am somewhat addicted (what else are you going to do on a tuesday night other than sit at home and watch tv?...rhetorical question alert).  peace out my children         "
256,Gemini,"           So here I am, listening to my neighbor's son's band, jamming in their garage, and watching Monsters,Inc., and blogging right along.  And the question of this day is....... Catnip? Is it the drug of choice for your cats, or do you, like a few others think that we shouldn't be drugging our kitties??  I give my cat(the monster Worf) catnip so he will stay quiet and not bother my other cat (Abby), and so that the house can rest from his antics. Abby on the other hand does not get catnip because she goes in heat which really bothers the little man cat Worf.  He then chases noisy Abby around and makes a lot of noise himself.  They both like to roll in it when I rub it on toys and on the carpet.  And Worf tends to slobber a lot when he eats the fresh catnip. I consider it a drug, and it is an herb, like marijuana, but I don't think the local law enforcement would approve of me growing the latter herb in my yard.( I will admit that I like the smell of marijuana, and it would make a wonderful incense.)But alas, it is still an illegal herb, and I really don't need the trouble that would go along with growing it, and using it.  Meanwhile, and back to the catnip, I can grow that legally, even though it is a drug for my cats, and I myself have been known to eat a leaf to relieve the occasional stomach ache (and it does the trick for me) with the added side effect of causing me a bit of drowsiness, so if I really needed it I suppose I could use it to help me to sleep at night, which is an ongoing problem (not sleeping). I think this year, besides drying it for the kitties, I will be drying some for tea, to relieve my stomach when it is being unruly.  And another question...Since marijuana is a drug, is catnip a drug too??          "
257,Capricorn,"           I was fucked, seriously knackered, seven days of hardcore socialising has resulted in me losing the will to drink.  I was shocked, a shiver ran down my spine, what was the world coming to if I could not bring myself to even sip on the Vodka Redbull that was in my hands?!?  It has been a cracking week here in Barca, bit of Oveja Negra on Monday and then onto Models Night at Bar-Salona on the Tuesday.  Managed to get ourselves a table, survived the dodgy Arabian music and then felt like 100% party pimps for the rest of the evening.  Waltzed on down to see Tom Cruise strut his stuff in Japan with Edgar and Steffen on the Wedsnesday, having been sufficiently amazed at his ability to pick Japanese up, off the cuff, in a couple of months decided that if Tom can do it so can anyone (will be going to Japan in the summer ;op).  Thursday was Weiteke's last night, a lounge at Carpe Diem was booked and bedded revelry did take place, VIP'd it until they kicked us out and then moved on to Club Sutton.  Met up with a some CEMS people and ended up at Bar Paris, guaranteed!  Friday, me and Steffen went all out, trying to educate the newcomers, so with a bit of a forsnizzle we moved onto the delights of Chupitos!  Even Edgar got involved and then stopped by the police for looking too dodgy!  After a condom and an orgasm or two we walked a little less steadily up the hill to Costa Breve.  Again Bar Paris afterwards, bo!    So me and Steffen arent so lonely any more, starting all over agin is real difficult, me and Edgar just talking this minute about how it aint the same without the chance to pop down to Scobie's and know your gonna see tim or ulli with their faces glued to the screen!    Ulli, if you dont wanna send an email then I dont mind doin it, would be cool to get a weekly update from everybody all across Europe.

260,Pisces,"       i haven't traditionally been all about posting links up here -- but i ran across this one this morning -- and it uses different language and theory than i'm used to, but it gets at a whole group of issues i've been thinking about -- and in a way that is appealing to me.    urlLink 'policemen & shepherds'  deals with questions like 'who is the church?' -- 'who isn't the church?' -- and -- 'what should the church's role in deciding who's in / who's out be?'  lynn and i are in a sunday school class going through the heidelberg  catechism and this week we did sacraments --   the whole idea that the church -- any church -- should be about policing the sacraments -- deciding who does and doesn't partake, who can and can't, who should and shouldn't -- in general, seems abhorent to me....  did you see  urlLink daniels' send up  of my most recent posting?  its funny.

261,Scorpio,"              Lull  Am suddenly filled with the depressive haze that assaults me in periodic moments.  After the high from learning and utilising my brain at the Rikk Watts seminar over the last couple of days, coupled with the social performance of maintaining friendships over a meal, I'm suddenly feeling really, really, for lack of a better word,  sian .  I suddenly feel like I'm being extremely unproductive. Lots to do - but it's all a blur of tasks that I'm not quite up to doing. It's all the planning I have to do - hate sitting at a desk, interacting with a voiceless machine, and trying to articulate the swim of thoughts and things-that-need-to-be-done in point form. Am expected to plan and strategise. but am neither equipped nor have the passion to do so! I totally dislike a desk-bound job.  And there's the praying meeting in an hour-and-a-half's time, which I don't feel like going to, yet don't wish to spend my night distracting myself with the meaningless void of watching TV or a movie. It's a waste of time, which I've always known, yet can't seem to tear myself from. Hence I've to put my foot down on that one right now. Which is why I'm going for the meeting.

267,Virgo,"   I decided to create yet one more category for this blog entitled, 'Antinomianism.'  I really do hope I can keep the blog titles to a minimum.  However, I believe this is a good one.  In this I will speak about all those nasty 'vices' in which a Christian may be grasped; such as liquors, beers, (alcohol in general), cigars, (tobacco in general), night-life activity, fine pubs, etc.  Tonight, since my sweet Beth is still away on the east coast, I bought more cigars to find a 'decent' and 'cheap' one I can purchase in larger quantity to fill my humidor.  You see, I smoke cigars so rarely because I only like the expensive AVO's, Monte Cristo's, Dunhills, etc.  I cannot afford to smoke as often as I would like to because of the cost.  Who can afford $10.00 and $15.00 cigars?  I certainly cannot... yet!  So, I've been purchasing cigars from a smoke shop in Escondido (which has a NICE walk-in humidor) ranging in price from $8.00 to $4.00.  If I buy a cigar in a shop for $8.00, that means I can buy it online in a box of twenty-five for at least $5.00 a cigar, and maybe less!  The first few times trying several cigars in that price range I almost puked.  They were horrible!  HOWEVER, I have now found a great cigar that is the cheapest I've purchased so far at $3.95 per cigar.  It is a Don Thomas short.  It is the PERFECT cigar to buy by the box-load.  The taste and aroma are similar to my favorite Monte's and such.  I tested the cigar with my single malt, twelve-year aged Glenmorangie Port Wood Finishd Scotch.  I must say it passes the test with flying colors!  I will now search for this Don Thomas cigar at R.J. Reynolds and the likes.  It is worth it and then some. "

275,Cancer,"       &nbsp;  aside: you know you've done well with your lunch when the stacked sandwiches are as tall as they are wide...  as i sit planning - yes, planning - what to write i am torn as to what my actual aim is; if i am diverting then that is more than good enough, but surely i have something more to share? to this end i will attempt, from time to time,&nbsp;to expound on some of the theories i have formed about how things work. if nothing else, it will be a useful insight to the way my mind works, and how i perceive the world.  the first that comes to mind is 'leapfrogging buses', or 'how to not get infuriated on your way home'. more on that in&nbsp;a minute.  &nbsp; hold your thumb and first finger out, very close together. now, without them touching, try to move them closer. closer still. yes? now, that is how close i was to buying a polaroid instamatic camera on thursday. i saw one (two, actually, but one appeared to date from the paeleolithic era and wouldn't have looked out of place with a pin-hole) in a charity shop, and spent a good five minutes toying with the idea. i've always wanted one, that i can remember; something about the self-containment appeals to me. but i didn't buy it in the end out of respect for my ever-dire financial situation (camera = cheap; film = expensive) and also the thought that i may be mistaken for someone taking 'candid' (nudge nudge, wink wink, say no more squire) photos at home. a label i wouldn't mind so much if it was a remote possibility, but sadly not.  today's list is of things that are not really fruit but can be classed as one of the day's five portions since they are healthy: a glass of milk vitamin supplement pill opening a window taking the stairs thinking about having some fruit  its true; you know it is.  &nbsp;   leapfrogging buses: a theory.  more of an observation, really.  some simplifying assumptions:  i) all buses travel the same route, at the same driving speed. ii) all passengers are travelling to the end of the line.  iii) all distributions are normal. iv) there are no price/ticket considerations in choosing buses. v) all stops are the same duration.  (these&nbsp;will be dismissed in turn, but to illustrate the idea i've&nbsp;started it as simple as possible)  imagine there are people waiting for the bus at every stop. one bus travelling the route will stop at every stop to pick people up, and take a certain amount of time to do the run.   this is obvious; but more interesting is if there are two buses travelling next to each other. assuming i) to be valid (as is the case on my way to/from work), people will signal for the first bus, which will stop. assuming ii) to be valid, the second bus will not stop and will overtake the first. the buses have now swapped positions, and will 'leapfrog' each other down the route, stopping at  every other  stop and thus&nbsp;completing the run&nbsp;faster.  however, buses tend not to set off together; it makes no business sense. but, if iii) is valid then there will be a statistical variation on the number of people waiting for the bus at any stop at any time. in truth, the variation is not truly random but follows a certain pattern (rush hour, etc) with  an amount  of variation built-in. and if there is a variation, then we can say that v) is not valid.&nbsp;so; if we are to imagine there is, at a certain stop at a certain time, significantly more people than the mean number of people at any stop at any time(which is statistically very likely) then the solitary bus will be signalled and will have a long stop for everyone to board. this will delay that particular bus, and the next bus along the route will gain some time on it. a feedback loop is created: the first bus is taking longer to do the run since its stops are longer, this leads to a greater build-up of people at the following stops and will cause  those  stops to be longer also. the second bus may not encounter the same heavy numbers of passengers, and so will gain on the first bus, moreso as the first bus is continuing to make longer and longer stops. eventually, the second bus will catch up, and the two will begin to leapfrog.  &nbsp; so we have leapfrogging buses; if these are running faster than a single bus would, then it is conceivable, is it not, that the two would eventually catch up with any single bus ahead on the same route? bingo! three buses in a row.  assumption iv) need not be discussed heavily since people will either simply signal the first bus that comes along (which is statistically more likely to be a 'first' bus of a pre-leapfrogging pair), thus not affecting the leapfrogging behaviour,&nbsp;or will have a ticket for a certain bus&nbsp;company, which modifies the idea from being 'any bus' to 'buses of a certain company', treating each company separately.  whilst assumption ii) is not valid in the general case, it does not affect the behaviour  in the long run . also required is the possibility of there being no people waiting at the stop; all the possibilities of first bus/second bus stopping are thus:  yes/yes: no distance/order change between buses yes/no : decrease in distance between buses, possible leapfrogging no/yes: increase in distance between buses, no leapfrogging no/no:&nbsp;&nbsp;no distance/order change between buses  if all these occur randomly then their overall effect is that described earlier, to promote leapfrogging.  &nbsp;  and there we have it; my idea as to why (particularly at peak times where it is more likely that there are people at each stop) buses can bunch up in twos and threes. i have no idea if this has been postulated anywhere else; i certainly haven't looked for it. but do let me know what you think, or if i don't make sense somewhere, which is quite likely.  anyhow, i'm making chop suey. excuse me.  n.

276,Gemini,"           There's a job I've always wanted, but I'm not quite sure how I'd actually get into the business. Butt double. In Hollywood films, occasionally a script will call for a nude scene. Heaven forbid that an actor who signs on for a role like that will dare to show their own flesh. And so being Hollywood and offering a wealth of available cash for all manner of pointless roles on a movie set,  urlLink body doubles  do in fact exist.  And to be honest, I think I have an okay arse. It's not fantastic. It has some flab, but I'm not so sure that this is going to be an obstacle. While I doubt that I'd be subbing for Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom anytime soon, I think I could potentially score some work by billing myself as a butt double for character actors. The question then is how do I present my ass to the world? I mean, my ass will be out there for the world to see, I'd prefer that I'm looking my best. Yet, at the same time, as a butt charactor actor, I need to ensure my bum will be looking its most realistic. Would it be unethical to work on keeping my rear end looking trim and taut? Would it be wrong to take care of the odd whispy hair or two?     And so, at this point I ask myself the question that all character actors ask at some point: What would Clint Howard do?      Clint Howard is the consumate character actor. With over 150 appearances in a career thats spanned much of his life, Clint has been seen in everything from Seinfeld to Beethovens 5th. Would Clint shave is arse for the screen? I doubt it, the man hasn't become the household name he is by being that shallow.                                                                           # # # # # # # # # # #   As I've no shame. I'll send out a plug for a worthwhile service. And so I mention Gmail, the soon to be launched service from Google. It's just like hotmail, but better. And why? Well, they have lazy people like myself in mind. It's a pain in the arse to actually press the delete button. But Gmail offers so much more space. It's super sweet. I'll never have to bother deleting again. Now I can archive all the add-three-inches spam I want.          "

281,Cancer,"           I'm so tierd, exhausted, and frusturated. About everything. About school, about sports, about relationships, about my life at this moment. I just want things to slow down so I'm able to get through it one step at a time, so I'm able to think about one thing at a time, and so I'm able to realize what has happened and what will happen.   I'm tierd physically. I woke up at 9 today for lacrosse which went to 11 and then I went straight to soccer practice which ended at 12:30. Wed. I'll be going to the weight room in the morning, have lax practice after school, and then have soccer practice at 6. It's insane and I still have homework on top of that, I don't think I like that so much. Good thing I can just put soccer on hold for right now, it'll help. I'm tierd with my emotions too. I'm sick of acting like a bitch and acting sad and gloomy. I have been much much better though, but then again I'll get moody and it goes to hell from there. But I'm sick of waking up mad in the morning when I really don't have to. It's funny because this morning the thought that has been popping into my head for like the last week but the person for the last month didn't when I first woke up today. But then I thought about that and it did and it's weird but he's also been in my dreams  some how, if not physically, he is. His screen name weird enough was in my dream last night. But anyways, I'm just tierd about how things have been going and honestly I just want to sleep through it.   Ok clearly I'm exhausted, I suppose that's the same as tierd almost. I'm also exhausted of trying to understand, it hurts my head now and I don't know what to do. I'm exhausted of trying to get my point across because I sometimes don't think there is even a point in doing that.   I'm frusturated about how things are at this moment. I'm frusturated at myself for diong so much at once sometimes, it's fun, don't get me wrong, but it scares me and frustruates me that I then complain, but I don't mean to. I'm scared for my grades and my health, but whatever, I'm not going to end something and put something on hold. I've done this plenty before and it's all worked out, it's even worked out better then I have thought before. Sometimes when you're scared and actually still continue and pursue something, you no longer become afraid and then strive for more once you know your abilities. And this applys to everything, once you pursue something when you're scared everything becomes possible. I'm frusturated that I don't understand, and I'm frusturated that he's frusturated that I may not even care about his reasons and his side, but I do, it just shouldn't be that way and it just doesn't make sense to me. I'm frusturated about being frusturated, funny how that works.   Urgh everyone is now talking about prom. It's in a month, wow. That makes me sad because I want to go, but right now I'd only want to go with one person, friends or more, that one person woudl make my night. But I don't know. 2 weeks ago I pictured the funnest most exciting night, but now I'm almost dredding it. Prom is supposed to be special, but honestly it wont feel to special if I'm not with him.

286,Libra,"                 I have no idea what is up with people today.  Elliott in the Morning (DC101's morning show) was a veritable conucopia of nut jobs.  For 30 minutes they talked to a 60+ year old Barber in Rockville, MD who likes to wear a bra and fake 44 D's while he cuts people's hair.  So this fella, Luis, dressed up and became Luise, I felt bad after a while 'cause they were going a little far, but it was funny.  But they were also pressing him about being gay even though he said he wasn't.  I mean there is a difference between cross-dressing and homosexuality.  I thought that we all figured this out with J. Edgar.    And then afterwards some people in traffic called in and said that two girls with a camera were hanging out on the side of the road with a sign saying 'Show us your twins.'  People are so nutty some times.  I don't know if people actually obeyed their wishes, but I'm sure it was a site to see.  I wish that would happen when I'm in traffic, 'cause I get so damn bored.    Anyway, I think I'm now in love with Nick Hexum from 311(drool).  I'm gonna go fantasize now.    Oh yeah, and if anyone has a life that they can spare I'll give ya 50 bucks for it.             "

288,Aquarius,"       with another city.  I never thought I would like Los Angeles.  Never.  I thought I was an East Coast girl through and through.  Turns out, I could go either way.  Los Angeles isn’t anything I thought it would be.  It wasn’t as flashy as I had imagined.  It didn’t seemed as pretentious as it looks on TV and there was no preparing me for the weather.  LA was amazing and good to me.    I tend to fall in love with most cities that I visit.  Maybe it’s because travel is a carefree existence or maybe it’s because each city beckons to a different part of me.  Why did I fall in love with LA?  Well, it isn’t the rat race it seems to be or maybe I never came in contact with part of it.  And the sun shines everyday.  There are never clouds in the sky or rainy, mucky days (there are also not stars).  I knew this about LA, but I didn’t believe it.  My clouded East Coast brain couldn’t fathom endless days of pure sunshine.  How could you be sad in a place like this because whatever happens, at least it’s a beautiful day.    My love for LA is fleeting, though.  I know when I am home I’ll settle back into the humidity and heat and then the cool air of fall and the snow of winter.  I would miss the seasons if I lived here.  Endless days of sitting by the pool would begin to disorient me.  Life here would be like an endless vacation.  It would be like play, like pretend, just beyond the touch of reality.  And my love for LA is not true because it is shared with my love for London, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Morehead City.  LA is just another city to add to the list of places I could live if I ever decided to pack up and leave the state and family I know so well.  I never do make plans to move to the cities I love so much because I think if I lived there the magic would begin to disappear after a time and I don’t want that to happen.  I’d rather hold these cities in my heart as perfect gems nestled on hillsides or islands or by the sea, covered in fog or basking in sunlight.         "

293,Virgo,"   It's Graduation day today When summer ends you'll be on your way It's hard to believe it's gone so fast And all of our memories fall into the past It amazes me to think of next year Going to classes without having you near Things won't be the same without you around And I can't let go of the friendship I've found  So laugh with me; don't say goodbye Let's stop searching for answers to why Time moves slow when it should go fast But speeds so quickly to the day I'll see you last Could we have just one more year? Perhaps we could stay forever here Because the future is blurry; it scares me to see What life has in store for you and for me  So hit the breaks for a moment; ease up off the gas Because I don't wanna spend life looking to the past Let's wait for a moment and take it all in If we can't then this is a race I don't want to win I've got all I need with you at my side So slow down a little; let's try to decide  How we can stretch these moments on And try to stop the approaching dawn  But in the end; life goes on And one of these days I know you'll be gone All I can say is, on that day When you leave me to find your way On your own; wherever you roam I hope you always find your way home And there I'll be waiting for you, my friend Just because we're apart doesn't mean this has to end.

295,Aries,"           As a test run for a potential gig, I just spent the past 3 and a half hours transcribing a 37 min conference call. I think I failed miserably.  The company indicated that you have 90 min plus the length of the call after it ends. So, 9 AM call ended at 9:35. 9:35 + 1:30 = 11:05. 11:05 + :35 = 11:40.  I finished the damn thing at 12:30, an hour late... sigh...  Yet, I'm not sure if the soreness in my body from being so tense and adrenaline-driven for that long is worse than losing out on the cash.

303,Leo,"   Part B.  There are different kinds of structures which humans construct.  The statement that they are different seems to need no apology—for is it not readily apparent that social structures (such as families), are of a different kind than the physical structures of skyscrapers? (I am not, of course, intending the two to be unrelated, just different.)    I also do not think an apology must be made for the statement: not all structures are constructed equal.  I would begin to describe this distinction like this: first, it is readily seen that “conceptual” or “non-material” structures are primary and physical structures are secondary.  We might put it in the terms of parent-child; for example, skyscrapers can be seen as the child of social structures: they are “born” out of a vast complex of actors constructing a steel structure by “birthing” their normative structures “into” the physical world.  The building will bear all the marks of its parent-structure or structures—every aspect has been “planned” (constructed) for a “reason” (out of a complex of, in this case—most directly—social norms).    We might label this relationship as a “source”-based relationship—a skyscraper’s structural form can be traced to a “source” social structure(s)—an endeavor far to complicated and esoteric for me to attempt now.  Suffice it to say that I  have correctly set out good reasons for saying that humans are (structure) constructing beings and that unseen structures can be seen as primary to physical structures.    "

Once I was used to the writing style, the details took me in and I could almost imagine myself there with the heroine.  It is set mostly in the early 1600s and is the story of a young 'gypsy' woman who finds herself pregnant with nowhere else to turn.  Being very resourceful and a thespian by trade, she portrays herself as a young widow and seeks refuge in a convent.  The Abbey that she comes to is comprised of quite irregular nuns.  More of a home for the troubled women than a convent.  Five years later, following the death of the kindly Reverend Mother, she is confronted with her past.  The leader of the troupe that she was in and the father of her daughter has concocted a new scheme to seek revenge on a bishop.  Before long suspicion, betrayal and debauchery are rampant in the convent, fueled by rumors of witchcraft and demonic possessions.  To save the convent and her daughter, she must match wits with her former lover and divert his plans.           "

I guess he learned from Toby Keith, and that guy who sings that country song about the pledge of allegiance.   On the same topic really, I was driving by one of the churches in town and I saw that this Sunday is MARRIAGE PROTECTION SUNDAY. There is an bill going before Congress this week that will define what marriage is on a national scale. This will protect marriages. You know what I think will protect marriage in America, not having 5 out of every 9 marriages end in divorce. Not having shows on TV, which millions watch like 'Who wants to marry a midget?'....and 'Joe Millionaire'. These shows are more detrimental to marriage than a committed gay couple wanting to be able to share health insurance.   By the way, Jesus speaks a whole lot about divorce, but not at all about homosexuality. What would happen if Congress was looking at a bill that would make divorce much harder to do? Would churches across America rally around that bill? I really don't think so, because there are a lot of divorced folks in their congregation. Its funny how the church picks and chooses what it will fight for.   In addition, what about a bill that would give more money to the school systems across America? To raise teachers wages? To give health care to every person under the age of 18 who is without coverage? To raise the federal minimum wage to a level that a parent can support their family on?   Nope, just gays.

314,Gemini,"        While it is still unofficial, the dates are more or less firmed up. Market sources have it that Toyota will launch its new IMV (international and innovative multi-utility vehicle) on Indian roads in January 2005.   urlLink   But first, it is likely to unveiled before the Thai market towards September-October this year. The all-new vehicle will be taken to the ARAI, Pune for homologation in the second half of this year. It will be powered possibly both by CRDi diesel and petrol engines. Sources say the suspension system for the new vehicle is being currently tested on Indian roads on all-weather conditions on the Kijang, an older MUV. The Toyota will look at making the engines compliant with both Euro II and III emission norms since vehicles in India will be switching to a higher gear from April 2005. While the metros and major cities will graduate to Euro III emission norms and by that understanding to a higher quality of fuel, the rest of India will move up from Euro I to II norms. The engines will basically be designed to be sturdier and tuned up to deal with both fuel types. In fact absence of Euro III compatible fuel has prompted many car makers to postpone some new cars launches because their engines will not perform to the desired level, and will even suffer higher wear and tear. Market sources say the IMV Project is aimed at greatly enhancing Toyota’s competitiveness by optimising its worldwide development, procurement and production activities through orderly and efficient tie-ups among production bases outside Japan. Key to the network is the supply of various systems and major components between Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam and India. While this new structure will increase the degree to which Toyota’s production facilities in the Asia region mutually complement one another, it will also establish it as an important international supply base. Toyota production facilities in Thailand, for example, will fill the role of global supplier for pick-ups, MUVs and diesel engines. Annual pick-up and multipurpose vehicle production in Thailand will be expanded to 200,000 units, half of which will be earmarked for export to more than 80 countries and territories within and beyond Asean. Toyota will increase diesel engine production in Thailand to 240,000 units a year and expects to annually export 130,000 units. India is being made the base for production of manual transmission systems for various Toyota vehicles. The Rs 480-crore facility (at two locations) will have the capability to produce 168,000 units per annum. The rollout will begin this June. Meanwhile, even Rav-4 and the new Prado are tipped for a third quarter launch in India this year.           "
315,Gemini,       Welcome to my Blog!!!         
316,Virgo,"       Dialect Map of American English   Click on the map for a larger version  Not all people who speak a language speak it the same way. A language can be subdivided into any number of dialects which each vary in some way from the parent language. The term, accent, is often incorrectly used in its place, but an accent refers only to the way words are pronounced, while a dialect has its own grammar, vocabulary, syntax, and common expressions as well as pronunciation rules that make it unique from other dialects of the same language. Another term, idiolect, refers to the manner of speaking of an individual person. No two people's idiolects are exactly the same, but people who are part of the same group will have enough verbal elements in common to be said to be speaking the same dialect.   Three things are needed for a new dialect to develop: a group of people living in close proximity to each other; this group living in isolation (either geographically or socially) from other groups; and the passage of time. Given enough time, a dialect may evolve to the point that it becomes a different language from the one it started as. English began existence as a Germanic dialect called Anglo Saxon that was brought to England by invaders from Germany. The Anglo Saxon peoples in England were now geographically isolated from their cousins in Germany which allowed the dialects to evolve in different directions. Other invaders would also influence the development of English with their languages until the modern English we speak today has become so different from the modern German spoken in Germany that a speaker of one cannot understand a speaker of the other. Thus English and German are considered to be two different, though related, languages. The other modern languages in this family are Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, and Icelandic.   This issue of mutual understandability is what in theory is used to determine what is a dialect and what is a language, but in reality there are social and political issues involved too. The government of a country might declare that all the languages spoken in that country are actually dialects of one language in order to create the illusion of polital unity, while the government of another country might declare that the dialect spoken by its people is actually a unique language from other countries that speak dialects of the same language in order to create a sense of national pride. History is full of governments that have tried to impose a single language on all of its people with varying results: sometimes the minority languages go entirely extinct, sometimes they are reduced to surviving only as dialects of the majority language, and sometimes new languages are unintentionally created by a blending of the two languages.   This brings us to three other language terms that are worth mentioning here. When two or more groups of people who speak different languages need to communicate with each other on a regular basis and do not want to actually learn each others' language (such as when the European merchants started trading with other peoples around the world), they may develop what is called a pidgin language. This is a simplified language that usually has as few words as possible in its vocabulary (taking some from both languages) and has been stripped of any fancier grammatical rules like the use of multiple verb conjugations and tenses - a kind of 'Me Tarzan, you Jane' way of talking. A pidgin is nobody's native language and is used only in business settings. In fact, the word 'pidgin' may be derived from the way Chinese merchants mispronounced the English word 'business.' However, in some cases, the children in one of these areas might grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. When this happens, the pidgin can grow in complexity into a creole language with a larger set of grammatical rules and a much larger vocabulary that share elements of all the languages that went into creating it.   Finally, jargon is a specialized vocabulary used by people within a particular discipline such as medical jargon for doctors, legal jargon for lawyers, or academic jargon for college professors. While jargon words occasionally filter up into a mainstream dialect, they are usually used only by experts and only when they are discussing their particular field. Critics argue, with some justification, that jargon needlessly complicates a statement that could be expressed in a more clear manner. Users of it argue, also with justification, that it is a more precise manner of speaking, although many examples can be found (especially in politics and business) where it has been used intentionally to obscure the fact that the speaker is trying to avoid being precise.   The modern development of communications technology may possibly slow down the evolution of dialects and languages. For the first time in history, a single dialect (sometimes called Network Standard) can be broadcast over an entire country, so very few people are actually living in geographic isolation anymore. However, the existence of racism, poverty, and class distinctions cause some groups to remain socially isolated from the mainstream of a culture, giving rise to social dialects like Black English (Ebonics) spoken by some African Americans in urban areas. There was recently a great deal of political controversy (ignoring the linguistic facts) over whether Ebonics should be considered a unique language, a 'legitimate' dialect of English, or 'illegimate' gutterspeak. Also, teenagers enjoy creating their own dialects that they can use to quickly determine who is or is not part of the 'in crowd' and as a 'secret language' in front of their parents. These dialects tend to go in and out of fashion very quickly; by the time an expression has filtered up to the mainstream dialect adults understand, the teenagers have moved on to something else. Even the Internet has given birth to what might be called a new social dialect (derived from hacker jargon) containing words like IMHO, IIRC, and ROTFLMAO.   Contrary to what your teachers probably tried to tell you, there is no such thing as 'correct English.' Any manner of speaking that is following the rules of a dialect is equally 'correct.' Words like ain't are 'real' words in some dialects and perfectly acceptable to use. However, people are judged by the way they speak, and dialects carry different levels of social prestige with them based on the prejudices within a society. Generally, the southern dialects of American English carry a lower prestige, at least among northerners who will assume that a person speaking a southern dialect is less intelligent and less educated than they are. Some educated southerners even feel this way and will 'correct' their speech to meet northern standards. The New York City dialect carries the lowest prestige of all (Received Standard, a dialect of British English used by the BBC and the royal family, carries the highest prestige - even among Americans). For this reason, schools try to rid children of the local dialects they learned from their family and friends in favor of a more prestigious one. (Of course, some sentences like, 'Me are a educated person,' would be incorrect in every dialect.)   The map and list below show the major (and a few minor) geographic dialects and subdialects of English spoken in the United States. Many of these may be further subdivided into local subdialects that are not shown here. Obviously, the borders between dialect regions are not well defined lines as a map like this would imply, but a gradual transition extending on both sides of the line.       Click on the map for a larger version  General Northern (green, yellow, and blue)  This is sometimes also refered to as General American and is used in almost two-thirds of the country. It breaks down into the dialect regions below.  Northern  New England  Many of the Northern dialects can trace their roots to this dialect which was spread westward by the New England settlers as they migrated west. It carries a high prestige due to Boston's early economic and cultural importance and the presence of Harvard University. A famous speaker is Katherine Hepburn. They sometimes call doughnuts cymbals, simballs, and boil cakes.  New England, Eastern (1)  This is one of the most distinctive of all the American dialects. R's are often dropped, but an extra R is added to words that end with a vowel. A is pronounced AH so that we get 'Pahk the cah in Hahvahd yahd' and 'Pepperidge Fahm remembuhs.'  Boston Urban (2)  Like many big cities, Boston has its own dialects that are governed more by social factors like class and ethnicity than by geographic location. Greater Boston Area is the most widely spoken and is very similar to Eastern New England. Brahmin is spoken by the upper aristocratic class like Mr. Howell on Gilligan's Island. Central City Area is what most of us think of as being the 'Boston Accent.' In the last few years, Saturday Night Live has featured this dialect among a group of rowdy teenagers who like to videotape themselves. Also think of Cliff on Cheers, the only character on this Boston-based show to actually speak a Boston dialect.  New England, Western (3)  Less distinctive than Eastern, but more influential on the other Northern dialects.  Hudson Valley (4)  New York was originally a Dutch colony, and that language influenced this dialect's development. Some original Hudson Valley words are stoop (small porch) and teeter-totter. They call doughnuts (which were invented by the Dutch) crullers and olycooks.  New York City (5)  Unlike Boston and other urban dialects, New York City stands by itself and bears little resemblence to the other dialects in this region. It is also the most disliked and parodied of any American dialect (even among New Yorkers), possibly because many Americans tend dislike large cities. When an R comes after a vowel, it is often dropped. IR becomes OI, but OI becomes IR, and TH becomes D as in 'Dey sell tirlets on doity-doid street' and fugedaboudit (forget about it). This pronounciation is particularly associated with Brooklyn but exists to some extent throughout the city. The thickness of a speaker's dialect is directly related to their social class, but these features have been fading within all classes over recent decades. Famous speakers are Rosie Perez, Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinnie, Archie Bunker, Bugs Bunny, and (if you're old enough to remember) the Bowery Boys.  Bonac (6)  Named for Accabonac Creek in eastern Long Island, this dialect is rapidly dying out due to the influx of people from other areas. Back when New York City belonged to the Dutch, this area was part of New England, and Bonac shows elements of both dialects.  Inland Northern (7)  Combines elements of Western New England and Upper Midwestern. Marry, merry, and Mary are pronounced the same. They call doughnuts friedcakes.  San Francisco Urban (8)  Unlike the rest of California, which in the early twentieth century saw an influx of people from the South and other parts of the West, San Francisco continued to be settled by people from the Northeast and Northern Midwest, and elements of their dialects (North Midland, Upper Midwestern, Inland Northern) can be found. Mission dialect, spoken by Irish Catholics in a specific part of the city is very much like the New York City dialect.  Upper Midwestern (9)  Originally settled by people from New England and New York State who brought those dialects, this area was also influenced by Southerners coming up the Mississippi River as well as the speech patterns of the German and Scandinavian immigrants and the Canadian English dialects from over the border. It's sometimes referred to as a 'Midwestern twang.' They call jelly doughnuts bismarks. Minnewegian (Minnesota / Norwegian), a subdialect spoken in the northernmost part of this region was spoofed in the movies Fargo and Drop Dead Gorgeous.  Chicago Urban (10)  Influenced by the Midland and Southern dialects. Often spoken by the late John Belushi (Chicago's Second City comedy theater supplied many Saturday Night Live actors). SNL used to spoof it in the 'Da Bears, Da Bulls' sketches. They call any sweet roll doughnuts.  North Midland (11)  Created as the people in Pennsylvania migrated westward and influenced by Scotch-Irish, German, and English Quaker settlers. This and the South Midland dialect can actually be considered a separate Midland Dialect region that serves as a transition zone between the north and south. They call doughnuts belly sinkers, doorknobs, dunkers, and fatcakes.  Pennsylvania German-English (12)  This was strongly influenced by Pennsylvania Dutch, a dialect of German spoken by people in this area (in this context, 'Dutch' is actually a mispronunciation of the German word, 'Deutsch,' which means 'German'). Its grammar allows sentences like 'Smear your sister with jam on a slice of bread' and 'Throw your father out the window his hat.' They call doughnuts fasnacht, and they also invented dunking - from the German 'dunken' (to dip).  Western  Compared with the Eastern United States, the Western regions were settled too recently for very distinctive dialects to have time to develop or to be studied in detail. Many words originally came from Spanish, cowboy jargon, and even some from the languages of the Native Americans: adobe, beer bust, belly up, boneyard, bronco, buckaroo, bunkhouse, cahoots, corral, greenhorn, hightail, hoosegow, lasso, mustang, maverick, roundup, wingding.  Rocky Mountain (13)  Originally developed from the North Midland and Northern dialects, but was then influenced by the Mormon settlers in Utah and English coal miners who settled in Wyoming. Some words that came from this dialect are kick off (to die), cache (hiding place), and bushed (tired). They also call jelly doughnuts bismarks.  Pacific Northwest (14)  Influenced by settlers from the Midwest and New England as well as immigrants from England, Germany, Scandinavia, and Canada. Much earlier, a pidgin called Chinook Jargon was developed between the languages of the Native American tribes of this area. It would later also be used and influenced by the European settlers who wished to communicate with them. A few words from Chinook Jargon like high muckamuck (important person) are still used in this dialect today. (Note that, in this case, the word 'jargon' has a different meaning from the one discussed above)  Alaska (not shown)  Developed out of the Northern, Midland, and Western dialects. Also influenced by the native languages of the Alutes, Innuit, and Chinook Jargon. Some words that originated here are: bush (remote area), cabin fever, mush (to travel by dog sled), parka, stateside.  Pacific Southwest (15)  The first English speakers arrived here from New York, Ohio, Missouri, New England, and other parts of the Northeast and Midwest in the 1840s, bringing the Northern and North Midland dialects with them. Words originally used by the gold miners of this period are still used today: pay dirt (valuable discovery), pan out (to succeed), and goner (doomed person). The early twentieth century saw an influx of people from the South and other parts of the West. The people here are particularly fond of creating new slang and expressions, and, since Hollywood is located here, these quickly get spread to the rest of the country and the world (the influence of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was examined in Verbatim : part one, part two). During the late 1970s and early 1980s, an extreme exaggeration of this dialect that came to be known as 'Valley Girl' or 'Surfer Dude' was popular among teenagers and much parodied in the media with phrases like 'gag me with a spoon' and 'barf me back to the stone age.' Sean Penn in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Whoopie Goldberg in her one women show are two famous examples.  Southwestern (16)  By the time this area became part of the United States, there had already been as many as ten generations of Spanish speaking people living here, so the Mexican dialect of Spanish had an important influence on this area that became a melting pot for dialects from all over the USA. Some local words are: caballero, cantina, frijoles, madre, mesa, nana, padre, patio, plaza, ramada, tortilla.  Hawaii (not shown)  The original language of the Native Hawaiians is part of the Polynesian family. English speakers arrived in 1778, but many other settlers also came from China, Portugal, Japan, Korea, Spain, and the Philippines to influence the modern dialect. Hawaiian Creole developed from a pidgin English spoken on the sugar plantations with workers from Hawaii and many other countries. Some words are: look-see, no can, number one (the best), plenty (very). It isn't widely spoken anymore. Nonstandard Hawaiian English developed from Hawaiian Creole and is spoken mostly by teenagers. Standard Hawaiian English is part of the Western dialect family but shows less influence from the early New England dialect than any other American dialect. It has many words borowed from the original Hawaiian as well as some from the other Asian languages mentioned above: aloha, hula, kahuna, lei, luau, muumuu, poi, ukulele.    Click on the map for a larger version  General Southern (purple and red)  This dialect region matches the borders of the Confederate states that seceded during the 'Confederate War' and is still a culturally distinct region of the United States. Since it was largely an agricultural area, people tended to move around less than they did in the north, and as a result, the subdialects are much less uniform than those of the General Northern regions and have much more clearly defined boundaries. Other languages that had an important influence on it are French (since the western region was originally French territory) and the African languages spoken by the people brought over as slaves. People tend to speak slower here than in the north creating the famous southern 'drawl.' I is pronounced AH, and OO is pronounced YOO, as in 'Ah'm dyoo home at fahv o'clock.' An OW in words like loud is pronounced with a slided double sound AOO (combining the vowel sounds in 'hat' and 'boot'). Some local words are: boogerman, funky (bad smelling), jump the broomstick (get married), kinfolks, mammy, muleheaded, overseer, tote, y'all.  South Midland (17)  This area, dominated by the Appalachian Mountains and the Ozark Mountains, was originally settled by the Pennsylvania Dutch moving south from the North Midland areas and the Scotch-Irish moving west from Virginia. A TH at the end of words or syllables is sometimes pronounced F, and the word ARE is often left out of sentences as they are in Black English. An A is usually placed at the beginning of verb that ends with ING, and the G is dropped; an O at the end of a word becomes ER. ('They a-celebratin' his birfday by a-goin' to see 'Old Yeller' in the theatah'). A T is frequently added to words that end with an S sound. Some words are: bodacious, heap, right smart (large amount), set a spell, and smidgin. American English has retained more elements of the Elizabethan English spoken in the time of Shakespeare than modern British English has, and this region has retained the most. Some Elizabethan words that are extinct in England are: bub, cross-purposes, fall (autumn), flapjack, greenhorn, guess (suppose), homely, homespun, jeans, loophole, molasses, peek, ragamuffin, reckon, sorry (inferior), trash, well (healthy).  Ozark (18)  Made famous by the Beverly Hillbillies, this isolated area was settled by people from the southern Appalachian region and developed a particularly colorful manner of speaking.  Southern Appalachian (19)  It is a popular myth that there are a few remote regions here that still speak an unchanged form of Elizabethan English, but it isn't true. Linguists are still studying the specific differences with South Midland.  Southern  As the northern dialects were originally dominated by Boston, the southern dialects were heavily influenced by Charleston, Richmond, and Savannah. They tend to drop Rs the way New Englanders do, but they don't add extra Rs. Some words are: big daddy (grandfather), big mamma (grandmother), Confederate War (Civil War), cooter (turtle), fixing to (going to), goober (peanut), hey (hello), mouth harp (harmonica), on account of (because).  Virginia Piedmont (20)  When an R comes after a vowel, it becomes UH, and AW becomes the slided sound, AH-AW. Thus, four dogs becomes fo-uh dahawgs. Some local words are: hoppergrass (grasshopper), old-field colt (illegitimate child), school breaks up (school lets out), weskit (vest).  Coastal Southern (21)  Very closely resembles Virginia Piedmont but has preserved more elements from the colonial era dialect than any other region of the United States outside Eastern New England. Some local words are: catty-corner (diagonal), dope (soda, Coca-Cola), fussbox (fussy person), kernal (pit), savannah (grassland), Sunday child (illegitimate child). They call doughnuts cookies.  Gullah (22)  Sometimes called Geechee, this creole language is spoken by some African Americans on the coastal areas and coastal islands of Georgia and South Carolina and was featured in the novel on which the musical, Porgy and Bess, was based. It combines English with several West African languages: Mende, Yoruba, Wolof, Kongo, Twi, Vai, Temne, Ibo, Ewe, Fula, Umbundu, Hausa, Bambara, Fante, and more. The name comes either from the Gola tribe in Liberia or the Ngola tribe in Angola. The grammar and pronunciation are too complicated to go into here, but some words are: bad mouth (curse), guba (peanut - from which we get the English word goober), gumbo (okra), juju (magic), juke (disorderly, wicked), peruse (to walk leisurely), samba (to dance), yam (sweet potato).  Gulf Southern (23)  This area was settled by English speakers moving west from Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas, as well as French speaking settlers spreading out from Louisiana, especially the Acadians (see 'Cajuns' below). Some words are: armoire (wardrobe), bayou (small stream), bisque (rich soup), civit cat (skunk), flitters (pancakes), gallery (porch), hydrant (faucet), neutral ground (median strip), pecan patty (praline).  Louisiana (24)  There's a lot going on down here. Many people in southern Louisiana will speak two or three of the dialects below. Cajun French (the Cajuns were originally French settlers in Acadia, Canada - now called Nova Scotia - who were kicked out when the British took over; in 1765, they arrived in New Orleans which was still French territory) carries the highest prestige of the French dialects here and has preserved a number of elements from the older French of the 1600s. It has also borrowed some words from the Spanish who once controlled this area. There are many local variations of it, but they would all be mutually understandable with each other as well as - with some effort - the standard French in France. Cajun English borrows vocabulary and grammar from French and gives us the famous pronunciations 'un-YON' (onion) and 'I ga-RON-tee' as well as the phrase 'Let de good times role!', but movies about cajuns usually get the rest wrong. A famous authentic speaker is humorist Justin Wilson, who had a cooking show on PBS, with his catch phrase, 'How y'all are? I'm glad for you to see me.' New Orleans is pronounced with one syllable: 'Nawlns.' There is another dialect of English spoken in New Orleans that is informally, and some would say pejoratively, called Yat (from the greeting, 'Where y'at'), that resembles the New York City (particularly Brooklyn) dialect (more info). Provincial French was the upper class dialect of the pre-Cajun French settlers and closely resembles Standard French but isn't widely spoken anymore since this group no longer exists as a separate social class. Louisiana French Creole blends French with the languages of the West Africans who were brought here as slaves. It is quite different from both the Louisiana and standard dialects of French but is very similar to the other creoles that developed between African and French on various Caribbean Islands. Married couples may speak Creole to each other, Cajun French with other people, and English to their children.

Everyone is basically over, it's gonna be a party! w00t. Yeah, I had  that track meet this morning at like 7:30 til about 6-ish. That was so not fun! But, I didnt get as burned as I did last weekend. Thats a good thing. Im still in a crappy mood from last night. But Im kinda better now. I guess. But not like that matters. I dont care anymore.  I have the get up kids stuck in my head, I really want to talk to somebody in perticular, and I can't which makes me mad, but im not a home, so that makes me un-mad....just a little. Im gonna go.

322,Libra,"           Music: Muse - 'Falling Away With You'   I was talking to a couple of old friends today.  I hurd them talk about what they did yesterday, about how they get up and go to church every Sunday morning. How bizzare.  Ideas like that are just bizzare to me.  How can so many people have that much dedication to one thing, for so long?  Now, I can understand having dedication in something like that if it was say, marraige, school something along those lines but with that, it's always something new, bold and interesting.  Doesn't the church feed you the same stories that you've probably hurd since you we're a child?  I'm sorry, but repeditiveness is one of my ultimate pet peeves.   I don't exactly write off the theory of a 'greater power,' so to say, but I can't agree with something that can't give me explanation and facts. I'd rather have nothing to believe in than believe in something I can't rely on and prove.   The other thought, is the thought of having someone have control of your life. I know that you say 'he doesn't control it, he just gives you options.' To me it sounds too much like a buisness. And I don't want someone else to have control of anything. I've always been told, 'I'm my own person, no one can dictate me.' So I'd sure as hell like to live it that way.   Another thing, not too far off subject, but not exactly about the 'Evolution,' objection and what not, is the question of the end of the world.  The Apocalypse as it where.   Have you ever woken up, in the middle of the night, when it's pitch black, and not realizing it's only 3-ish and you thought the world was over? What would you do in the last few moments? For the brief moment of confusion, I get paniced. I realized that I haven't said half of the things I wish I would of, and that I haven't did half the things I would of liked to. But I know that in the few moments left, I could'nt get half of those accomplished. Thus, feeling regret, and sorrow. I think that's what scares me.   I'm not scared of the Apocalypse or dying for that fact. I'm scared of not doing the things I need to do, or say the things I need to say.   Thats enough of my deep thoughts for you, for now.  I'm sure I'll be back later with more.          "

324,Taurus,             In the midst of a good day i recive a letter in the mail informing me that i've been cut from the high school baseball team due to missing the entire offsesson which really pissed my coach off. So all i have left right now is cross country which somtimes i resent because the runners are all skinny and jealous of my muscles. My dad didn't care because he says that running can get me more places than baseball can. I think that is bullshit but everybody has their opinions so why should i get upset? Anyways i have to try out for baseball again but i don't think the coach will give me another chance at it so i probably just going to stick with my select team because i have a better chance of getting into college with this team than the high school team. We play Carrol in an exhibition game at Pittman. They'll be preaty easy but not that easy. Moody kicked our ass but King fell mercifully when i hit that double that brought in 2 runsso in other words we beat them not very badly but badly. So fall ball is approaching and the start of my select team's offseason is near so i probably won't be writing in here occasinally so PEACE!

I've lost count of the amount of times that people have said 'just because we like science fiction doesn't mean we have to talk about it all the time.'  Science fiction isn't something we are, we are normal people with other interests as well.  It really annoys me.  There is one particular person that comes in, she has in the past said that if we're not talking sci fi, we should leave the room.  These are the regulars she's talking to.  You can imagine how well that went down.  This is also the girl that said that people wnet into space because of star trek, that everyone will eventually have their own private aircraft, and that she wants, when she dies to donate her organs then have her body shot into space so that, get this...'the aliens can find me and ressurect me'.

335,Aquarius,"       saturdays and sundays are the most memorable days in the lyf of a cadet.. during these days we used to rot and make happy. During saturdays we've experienced the most tiring part of cadets lyf. During friday night cadets are sleepless preparing things, fixing the room, ironing uniform, shining shoes, shining metal parts of uniform, follow-up underclassmen and etc. We are usually doing this in preparation of barracks inspection, ranks inspection and parade and review every saturday. Every saturday is a challenge and it adds up to our prestige everytime we overcome this day. During saturday morning barracks and ranks inspection, parade and review was done. During the afternoon cadets serving punishment take a tour around the boromeo field in BDA under arms to serve their punishment. While cadets who are snappy and not defficient in academics can have a privilege to go out in baguio city to visit their friends and poster parents otherwise cadets can entertain their visitors and friends inside the portals of the academy. Last friday night i went to sleep at 0100 at woke-up at 0430. First, i fixed my bunks and take a bath. I change my uniform for the sword and rifle drill early mess at 0530. at 0600, we rehearse the whole sequence of parade and review. We went back to barracks at 0700 to finalize our things. at 0745 i change my uniform to full dress white under arms for the barracks inspection at 0800, im happy coz i don't have any report of violations and demerits. At 0845 we went outside the barracks at quezon ave. for the ranks inspection, i got one report(loose thread, hehe). We are standing under the sun for an hour and went to the slope(the starting point of the parade). Usually, we waited for a long time before the start of the parade but that tym we only have 10 minutes and the parade starts. After the parade we have our noon mess at 1130. At 1250 we have the opening ceremony of our intramurals every companies have their muses. the assigned judges selects the best muse to represent the ccafp intramurals. the hawk company muse won, she is the former miss phillipines international and at present modeling at mexico. After the ceremony at 1600, 2cl and 1cl cadets went to baguio city for inviting privilege for the upcoming formal dinner and hop on august 21. we went back to pma at 2230. During sundays we have our religious services where in cadets went to their respective churches of their religion to worship. At sunday afternoon cadets who are serving punishment once again will tour around the boromeo field while those who does'nt have punishment enjoys the rest of the weekend. This sunday after the religious service all 2cl and 1cl cadets was given privilege to visit their poster parents. And i have visited too my poster parents. Now, another weekend will pass and another academic week to face...may god bless us all, always!     "

I didn't know Clinton had a war with France...... '* Insert Crickets Chirping Here *...... So I started this to spout my rhetoric and hope someone sides with me and agrees with the fact that all liberals should be melted from the trapped Alien's eyeball lazers in Area 51...     Who's John Kerry... Does anyone take this guy seriously??? I mean he's a walking joke... I love his new ad * insert pompous shouting like voice here * ' I have a plan to improve this economy and ad more jobs to the marketplace ' * Insert Hollow Eyed Look Here * Now most people would indulge there plan on how to do it, how to improve, but not old John Kerry, he's to sly for those tricks, he's to smart to divulge his plans daddy... WHY???? BECAUSE HE DOESN'T F*CKING KNOW!!!!... He'll get back to you when the Democratic party feeds him some lines.... I envision John Kerry as a big Democratic Party Suggestion box and a Marionette puppet for Teddy Kennedy and his pals to funnel there thoughts through and act out there deeds for them because noone in America would vote for those clownshoes, unless we were in Bizzaroland..... AND KERRY'S FACE..... It's Horrific!!!! What did he do??? Who did his parents piss off??? I mean I swear, if you stared at this dude long enough, your face would melt into lava! His face looks like he is a humongous leprachaun.... and a scary one at that.... John Kerry... Imagine Alec Baldwin in Beeltejuice, remember when he stretched out his face to scare the new owners of his house as a ghost??? Well that's what this dude, Kerry's, face looks like.... I swear it's like the longest face I've ever seen, I heard that on 9/11 he was advised to lay down all day to avoid planes flying into his face.... It was also nice of Kerry to come out the day of the new SpacePlane going into orbit that the government and Nasa opened to the public for and say ' This administration is not doing enough for science '.... I mean seriously he's lost, he has hollow eyes, he must be an alien, look at the guy, do you trust him for sight alone??? Hell NO!!! and his wife.... Whoaaaaaa..... She looks like a drunken Mike Myers Character on SNL' Coffee Talk ', a barfly sitting alone at the end of the bar trying to get the last redneck playing pool to go show her a good time. I wished Dean was the nominee at least then we'd have someone with a shred of personality running, instead of Stone Face Jenkins and his monotone, librarian type voice. At least with Dean you got someone with Compassion and Conviction even if he was an unbelievable moron.... But he was doomed by his Sloth Mating Squeel, like his nuts had been ripped off with no anesthetic....      If you're a liberal and reading this * Grabs Face like Adam Sandler Grabbed the face of the fat kid in Billy Madison and shakes it hardcore * WHAT THE F*CK ARE YOU THINKING????? ... Well that's a dumb question... let me rephrase it.... WHY DON'T YOU F*CKING THINK FOR ONCE!!!!..... The Country, Our Way of Life depends on the unity of the parties and the support for the most Billy Bad Ass President to put on a suit, and yet you constantly undermine him, why??? The people we are at war with don't care if you drive a chevy or drive a VW ( liberals ) , they don't care if you go to Kwik Stop for Coffee or Starbucks ( liberals ) they don't care if you have a bike rack on the top of your car ( liberals ) or not, they want to kill all Americans, not just a party and we're not at risk, because of our president we are at risk because they have perfverted a religion and have taken it upon themselves to obliterate all those who oppose them and there struggle for overwehlming power of the world. It's pretty clear, we either get rid of them or they get rid of us. It's as plain as day and night, there's not in between as you liberals like to claim.... If you like your life and the way it is and the security you've had you'll vote Bush... If you want that to change and you want to worry everytime you walk out of your house if you're going to come home at night, Vote Kerry I think the logical choice is right in front of you, but logic seems to escape liberals from time to time... SEE GORE,AL ( HE BETRAYED THIS COUNTRY>>> HE PLAYED ON OUR FEARSSSSSSS ! ) and this is all Because you want power... Brother... you had power once and look where it got us.... If Kerry wins the presidency we're all screwed, mark it down, put it in a book and date stamp it.... He's lack on defense and he has no sack to stand up to anyone, check his purple hearts, he was JFK reincarnated.      Well this is my first post, email me or leave a comment. Remember I'm young, I'm Conservative and I'm Opionated and not Politically Correct, so please forgive me if I offend, these are my beliefs and supported by noone but myself. But I hope people dig this site and get behind it and we can band together to overthrow the Douchecratic Party....          "
341,Aries,"       Woohoo - she'll be here tomorrow! - which probably means I need to clean the place up a bit - uh oh :(  Since Jen's going to get a car we'll be able to at least grab some furniture so she'll have somewhere to sit - and she has timed it perfectly for the pool opening on the weekend.  While I'm slaving away in work, she can lie by the pool and fight with the cicadas :)  Got my HDTV Cable hookup - unfortunately the on-demand function seems to have broken in the meantime, so I have to get out early again today so someone can come look at it.  On the brighter side of things techie I managed to blag two 1U dual PIII 866 machines for free, I'll swap the mobo's out into a more reasonable case and hook them up at home - no idea what I'll use them for yet but I'm betting that they'll munch a few SETI units in the meantime while I figure it out.....  One last thing - where the hell is the Alt Gr button on US keyboards? - it annoys me to have to type Alt+0128 for the Euro (€) symbol and then have to remember what the code is for accented e etc.  I know I could change the keymap to UK or whatever but I shouldn't have too - how about an Alt Gr option or something?  *end of rant*         "

344,Libra,"                     ONCE APON A TIME----THERE once was a very angery kid named JOhn Reed. JOhn was always angery about the dumbest stuff. one day he disobeyed his parents and turned on the t.v.(john wasnt alowed to watch t.v b/c it made him even madder.)so he turned the t.v to station 8. POKeMON was on. John got soo mad at the charaters,plots, and pokemon. he got so mad that he got up and got this dads golden gun and went down stairs and then he got so mad that his special ablity, transportation, came upon him. he was then transported to the world of pokemon. creepy. so he went around the 'crazy forest' and short wild pokemon. SO then 3 days latter,john, was getting pretty fed up of eating pokemon so he went out of the forest and desided to find Ash(the star of the t.v series) he found him playing with pikahu on a park bench in the city. he walk up to ASH with the gun. ASH, who had never seen a gun or gold before in his life. Ash asked him if was a fancy mustard holder. John(of course)said,'yeah, of course it is u loser'. so Ash being very hungery took the golden and stuck it in this mouth and shot it. Ash died with a smile on his face-because of his love for mustard.ummm.mustard. so then pikahu sat here laughing-cuz he had always hated ask but just never expressed it. for pikahu was a weed/heroin dealer-and had been slipping ASH huge amounts of cystal-meth ever since they had met. but Ash had become amune to it so it had no effect. so then pikahu said in a deep,big voice-said,'lets get outta here and have the time of our life!'. so john transported him and pikahu out of the t.v in time for dinner. FROM then on john kept pikahu in his closet and made him be his slave rat for the rest of his pokemon life(which is forever)(unless shot.) AT age 101 John was on his deathbed with pikahu chaned to this side(pikahu was cleaning the bedpans)(of course) with the last bit of effort John took out the golden-gun and told pikahu,'i am taken u with me,haha'.Pikahu said'o cccrap..iii' Bang they both died at the same time but he dint even use a bullet. thats because in the door why, stood the secert agent-MR.Linscott!but he had only used one bullet!and they both had been shot. and the romm was like john on bed-picahu on light stand-next to the bed and mr.s standing infront of them both.! the end.STORY OVER KIDDIES!(TALKING BEGINS AND HANDS RAISE) -----------------------------------------------------------------     **John Reed-{raises his had and says},'Mr.LINSCOTT that makes no cents-it would have been impossable.Stop using my name in every story, its getting so old.   **MR.LINSCOTT-{leans back in chair and smiles at john in a gay shorta way)Sweety,IT makes total  cents are u blinded.IT in my NEW book i just wrote, so it must be true'.{wink};)       **JohnReed-Nasty,No my door doesnt go that way.The story it just makes no cents{leans back in chair and begins playing tetris again.       ****DitzyBlondeGirL-tell us another story.How about the tiger story!!!!!please,please. awww come on.    **Danielle-not again, its so fake-make it stop.       **Caitlin-he is such a major crotch goblin.      **Mr.LInscott-have i told u the one about the pokemon.

346,Aquarius,"        Gracias!...Merci!...Salamat!...Thank You!   Thanksgiving day for me is typically comprised of morning mass, helping out with the meal preparations, entertaining family and of course...EATING! I love eating! IT'S SO AWFUL! But I couldn't help it. Our thanksgiving table was adorned with the best food my family could provide;  turkey, spaghetti, pad siyew, baked salmon, popeye's chicken, etc. you know, Filipino thanksgiving food.  But the best part of my day would have to be looking after my nephew, Kelsoe. He's 7 months now! So big is he, crawling, standing up, and chattering away what sounds like gibberish to me but must mean so many things to him. He fell asleep while I was feeding him yesterday afternoon and as sore as my arm was getting, I SO didn't care cuz I love this baby so much.  Ok, I'm a bit tired so I'm gonna end this now before I get really carried away. I spent part of the day helping my aunt decorate her house for Christmas and the rest helping my parents and my uncle paint our living room, and then playing taxi for my sister. My neighborhood is so chaotic this time of year because I live behind the mall. Seeing all that traffic got me even more fatigued. Until next time, I hope everyone had an excellent thanksgiving!         "

350,Leo,"       I just erased everything I typed...story of my life...I had something that I was really proud of...noticed that I didn't put a question mark in where there was one needed, so I hit the Back button, and it's all gone, and now the title of my post is very misleading, because it has nothing to do with what I'm writing...  I'll cut to the chase...I learned something today in Sunday School, another one of those things that I've been told, and taught before, but I never learned until much later on. So anyway, I've been in a bad mood for upwards of like (let's see, when did I get back from Galion?),  about 2 weeks now, and I'm just, I don't know, I'm trying to learn about the Bible, and the stories, and how they can be applied to me, and the nuances of the writings, and the peoples, and the tribes, and the cities, and things like that,  and I think I'm learning a lot, because I've asked some educated questions that have left Ryan at a loss for words, and I'm really proud of that, Ryan has taught me 98% of everything that I know about my faith, and when I can ask him a question and he replies with, 'I don't know, I'll look into that,' there aren't even words that can express how much joy I feel that I'm actually making him do some work and maybe he ends up learning something as well. Anyway, I do all that stuff, and I'm still in such a terrible mood, and it's kind of like, Why can't God let me be happy?' It's pretty simple to keep me happy, God remembers when I was happy. He knows exactly what I need, but I can't have it. So why won't he give it to me? Sunday School answer - 'Because he knows what makes us happy better than we do'. Funny story, I even said that today, and Mike ate it up. I say F that, I know what makes me happy. I know what made me happy, so I'm pissed. And I told you that story to tell you this one, Mike moved on, and kept talking and then I learned that God doesn't really care if I'm pissed at him. God is probably pretty happy that I'm pissed at him, because then at least I'm realizing that it's his fault that I'm pissed, and hurt, and learning that the only way I can feel these things is through Him. So I say: All honor, power, and glory be to God, even when he's a bastard and encroaching on my happiness.  Fin.          "
351,Aquarius,"             In any developing country (and I believe Korea is 'developing' and really only started on the road to a real economy with the onset of real elections in 1994) there can be trials and tribulations for those who lead (politicians, heads of business) and follow (workers, students).  Don't get me wrong, Korea has made gigantic strides in the last 50 years (thanks mainly to the iron-grip of their president/dictator from 1961 to 1979, Park Chung Hee) and in the last 10 years (when Korea really started to open up to Western influences)--but things are still in a state of flux here.  Business practices have changed (although they retain much of the old flavour), politics...well, politics seems to still be the same..., relationships between people has changed (albeit only a little, Koreans still follow Confucius tenets and defer to age, men and the learned) and even language has changed (as the Internet and chatting has lead to the truncation of many words).  With these changes comes inefficiencies.  One can capitalize on them or be a victim.  The lady in the BMW below may have done both.  She is likely enjoying the ride in her Z4, but (according to  urlLink this newspaper article  she is also a victim of over-pricing--something that BMW, I assume, does not mind as they can have a higher profit.  (One other part of this may be that BMW has certain 'import duties' over and above the government ones that need to be paid in order to sell their cars here, such is another inefficiency.)   urlLink     The BMW Z4...a pricey car in this town.   But what about those who cannot afford a luxury car, a flat in Kangnam (the priciest district in Seoul) and an expense account at the local watering hole?  Or worse, those who had it all and then lost it?  What happens to them?  Well, for some, the answer is suicide (hence my mention of  urlLink BASE jumping  (Buildings, Antennae, Spans and Earth) in the title.  Since there are few guns in Korea (heck, many policemen do a  urlLink Barney Fife  and don't even walk around with a loaded gun, the bullets are in their pocket!) the next best thing is jumping.  While inline skating one day near the river I saw police taking 2 jumpers from the water--ug,that was not cool.  Sorry for the imagery.  One thing that irks me about Korea sometimes is the lack of discretion in some matters (one faux pas I probably just committed above).  We know that reporting suicide can lead to more suicides, but they continue to report suicides as they happen.  Some of the stories are truly heart-wrenching and I (yes, even I) weep a bit when I hear some of them--this is not something you get desensitized to.  If you're of strong mind take a look at this article on recent  urlLink suicides .  Of course, it's not just in Korea.  In the  urlLink U.S. military suicide  is the #2 killer (I'm not sure if friendly fire or actual action are #1, you start to wonder sometimes).  The interesting thing I found from reading all of this (not that it makes me an expert by any means) is that Korea, although it may have the 4th highest suicide rate in the 29 OECD countries, it was waaaay down the list globally (Korea always wants to be #1 compared to the top nations, which is why they probably used this statistic).  Countries in Eastern Europe (although some of these 'suicides' may be underworld related), Scandinavia, and even the US and Canada, Hong Kong and Japan had higher rates than Korea did in 1994.  (From Table 1 in  urlLink this paper/abstract  In true Korean fashion, the rates here went from 6.8 per 100,000 in 1998 to 16.5 in 2000 and 18.1 in 2002...man, does everything here have a  urlLink logarithmic curve  to it?  Some also turn to  urlLink murder , such as happened 10 years ago and lately again (and I'm sure there were other cases in-between), but that's another story.  Perhaps this is just another part of living in a place where the past is meeting the future head on.          "

353,Aquarius,"         I was recently weighed by&nbsp;the Occupational Health&nbsp;Nurse at work.&nbsp; I was told that I am bordering&nbsp; ideal weight range according to my BMI (Body Mass Index) .&nbsp;&nbsp;Being 10stone 7lbs and&nbsp;only 5'3' I guess this is not good.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have come to the conclusion that I have become what I have always dreaded...I am&nbsp;plump.     &nbsp;   Just for good measure, mainly due to my love of food in general, especially Chinese, I have put on a few extra pounds, so I am probably now into the red zone of the chart.   &nbsp;   I blame my plumpness on yo-yo dieting.&nbsp; Each time I diet (the last one I did was apparently not a diet, more of a healthy eating plan) I end up not&nbsp;at what I like to call the 'Sod It' stage after a few months.&nbsp; After this things are down hill, and a bit, and yes, I end up weighing more than I did before I started. &nbsp;    &nbsp;   I got a new job 7 months ago, which&nbsp;involves me sitting on my arse in front of a computer for almost 7 hours each day, apart from the odd meeting, where I will walk from one end of the building to the other, then sit on my arse again.&nbsp; Is it possible to get deep vein thrombosis from working in this way.&nbsp; I hope not, but I know that it is adamn good way of putting on a dress size.&nbsp; I am now a good size 14.&nbsp; This doesn't help my cause.      Reality hit a few days ago, when I realized that my beloved halter neck tops were beginning to look a little naff due to this extra weight I am harboring.&nbsp; Having just watched You Are What You Eat on TV, and seeing a bloke with a really swollen and bruised stomach, I decided to stop holding my stomach in and take a good look in the mirror.

That was the point.&nbsp; Immediately I donned the old sweat pants and went for a run.&nbsp; After getting a few yards down the road I was well and truly panting, but determined to at least get around the block I walked for a while, then jogged back (which is down hill luckily).&nbsp;     Feeling please with myself when I eventually got home, sweating and with a face  red  as a baboons back end, I decided that I deserved a treat and ordered a Chinese.&nbsp; Some habits just die hard.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;      &nbsp;                "

I nodded and he replied, 'Didn't that idea fade out with most of the Catholics?'

361,Pisces,"             In DC for a few days. For the first time since S.O. lived here when we were wee kids in love, I took Amtrack down. However, thanks to some travel experience, was bumped up to first class, which was a delight. The tea was always handy, just like on Continental's first class flights, but the difference here is that a. you can use your cel phone and b. they have outlets for each seat, which for a guy like me who seemingly has become physically grafted to his laptop, is a blessing. This is a far cry from the last time I was on an extended train ride, which was in Mother Russia (see theaggression.com tour diary for details), however, the Russian dining cars are the BEST (right, Matt?).  Therefore, the 2 and a half hours on the Acela Train gave me time to work on the HF2 song TWOBASSES, which I have mentioned previously. It's a tough song with a lot of parts, so the bulk of my time was spent figuring out how to mesh the very fast part with the very slow part. NOT easy, but I made some headway and thus I am looking very forward to my train ride back to NYC (hopefully) this afternoon to get deeper into it. I think, and this is for those in the corp. reading it, I'm going to add little noises and such from the faster part and pepper them throughout the slower part for continuity. I sound like a chef.  Anyhow, I am staying at the Willard in DC. Fancy-ass hotel. Awesome. My lovely S.O. would dig the hell out of this place. But historically significant because it is the bar where Ulysses S. Grant would drink. All the politicians who wanted his ear would hang out in this lobby to wait for him to get him to sign off on things while he was wasted on rye. Hence, the term 'lobbyists'. How cool is that?! That's your history lesson of the day.  The kids in Cyaontic wrote me to say their remix for the aggression EP should be done today. I'll report on once they send me an MP3.  In the best news of the week, former aggression vocalist turned important screenwriter and his Mrs. have had their long-awaited baby, a girl, who's name, at the moment I don't know how to properly spell, so I will refrain from trying. Needless to say, it's not F.J. Everyone is in good health. The Mom called me and she sounded like she had just come back from shopping, while the Dad sounded like he just did 4 tours of duty in Iraq. Hilarious. Bless! I have no doubt that S.O. is currently shopping for MORE for this new child, as my lovely girilfriend has bought more clothes for this baby than I have in my closet.

The (true) story is: the North sent a platoon (31 men) of commandos to Seoul in January 1968 to kill then-president/dictator Park Chung Hee (he was later assassinated by a cabinet member in 1979). Their plan was thwarted, but the South wanted revenge so they set up an ultra-secret crack team of 31 (always have copy, it seems) of their own. But, they didn't recruit from the general infantry or even the armed forces at all. The members of Unit 684, as it was called, were criminals on death row who (they found out afterwards) were already known as dead to the world and, thus, would not be missed if they failed (or if they succeeded).   The 31 went through extensive and brutal training on Silmido (Silmi Island) but 31 real special forces members plus a commander. For 2 years they prepared themselves physically and mentally to 'slit the throat of Kim Il-Sung' (the leader of NK at the time, and father of the current dictator, Kim Il-Jung). The time to leave and complete their mission came and they set out to Pyongyang...but at the last moment it was cancelled. The Minister of Intelligence had changed and relations had thawed between the two Koreas (I wonder what catastrophe would have befallen this place if they had succeeded). With no reason to be, Unit 684 was to be terminated.   The story goes on a ways from there, and everyone knows it..which may have been the point of the South Korean government. Imagine if a foreign power (and hated enemy) sent a team to kill President Bush or John Major...how could they just let it go. But, as in this case, how could they let it happen? This sacrificing of deathrow inmates makes sense from a political point of view. The South got to show that they were ready, willing and able to go after Kim Il-Sung, but, in the end, it would have probably put the Peninsula back in to a brutal and devastating war.    urlLink     Silmido and The Dirty Dozen: the true story is more unreal than fiction.    At least The Dirty Dozen achieved their mission...but it was just a story, maybe based on Silmido, who knows?          "

364,Libra,"       'I feel diseased Is there no sympathy, for the sun  The sky's still fire But I am safe in here, from the world outside So tell me What's the price to pay for glory' - Finch  Hate. I think Hate is a strong enough word. But maybe it's not.  I hate him. That's all there is to it. I can't stand to think about him, I can't stand to look at him, I can't even stand to say his name. So I'm not. He acts like he's my best friend, he acts like he doesnt know me. His a double-eged sword, and I sometimes wish that I never became friends...with him. But enough with that. I need some movie ideas. I gots my camcorder for xmas this year, and all the editing equipment to go along. I need to write scripts, and have willing-non-paid actors to come and be in my movies.  I get to go back to school on Monday. Not today. Next monday. Oh, joy. (sarcasim) I really dont want to go back, because that means I have to see certain people. But on the other hand I will get to see the gorgeous Jon, (see previous entry.) *smile.*  'There I am standing all alone on the Sydney Harbor Brige.

365,Gemini,"       A note on the wonders of human emotion, hope, love, peace, heritage.  The scope turns to India...long have I warred with pride and shame of where this Queen was molded - however indirectly. At long last, the dawn breaks on the horizon of my mind and Pride, deeply embedded in there somewhere, has come to the forefront.  What started this you may ask? One of my historian channels reported to me, and I've seen and heard things on the Taj Mahal, perhaps hundreds of times. But for some reason today, I took notice and what I saw made me feel incredibly close to the great hearts of history. Hearing it makes me feel that it's true - you cannot describe it unless you see it reflected off the teardrop of a lover's cheek as they gaze in amazement. Shah Jahan was declared insane by his own son and locked away, where he pined forever, obsessed over his young bride's premature death. His every breath was steeped in the intoxication of his love for his wife and to see the Taj mahal to completion and hope it could but reflect a small amount of the essence that made her special to him. His last breath was taken gazing at a building that didnt come close to glorious wonder that was his young love. Across the way was the building his mother, Lul Jahan, built for her parents...the first structure in marble. The lattice screens were all carved from a single slab ..never joined, gems were brought in to complete the intricacy of the fantastic building as a testament to the love she bore her parents. Is there any other more hopeful wonder in this world for those who have none? It's a timeless tribute to love in it's purest and diverse forms, for that of a child, parent, friend, kindred soul or deeply spun true love.   Then there is Rishikesh..land of the Gurus, nestled amoung the trees near the foothills of the Himalayas on the banks of a flowing holy River. Beyond it's temples...in Masuri..8000 ft high, rooftop to the world they say, and AT the foothills of the Himalayas. I want to walk through it's peaceful grounds and cemetary that attests the presence of men and women, fallen in previous battles, childbirth or simply to go in peace, gazing at the wonder of the world. These women were placed with honour to lie amoung the men, not cast out because they were unclean, unpure etc. There has got to be something in it, if so many have returned to this holy place to cleanse themselves and stay..to die. To stand above the world, as high as they dare...and finally let go.   There is also a school there, a fantastic school I never knew existed...called Woodstock, it houses children from all over the world. it's a requirement that there are equal numbers from major countries so the children leave with a better knowledge of India, other cultures, and themselves. They are students most readily accepted into Universities, who cling to their teachers crying when time for them to go. They talked...at ages 12-16, of how at peace they are there, how their mornings greet them with the best sunrises, sounds of nature, purity. Their days carry them in the presence of constant learning from their teachers and peers alike, cultural differences united under one roof, one classroom, and above all...understood, accepted. They have no technologies (as yet) and they bond so strongly that countries seperate them but communication never breaks down. This school deserves our respect...and our support.   This is ...wonderful. True hope for the youth of our future - oh if only they outnumbered the rest.  But even one tiny pebble in the ocean that surrounds us..will make thousands of ripples. Let's just hope those children cast their pebbles to save us all.            "

369,Libra,"              I will not take these things for granted   So, I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer (the movie) today and Toad the Wet Sprocket is definately on the soundtrack.  It's strange how you never think of two things happening around the same moment in time (yet alone the same decade) but I suppose some things are timeless and some wear their age on their sleeves.  I wish I had been more into Toad before they had broken up.  I definately liked them and loved the stuff that was on the radio but never REALLY got into their music/bought an album until a few years ago.  I really wish Glen Phillips (the former lead singer) would come back to play a show around here ( I think that's what I'm getting at with this post).  The intimate, acoustic, one man show is such a wonderful thing to watch.  Especially when it's a good (talented) artist that really doesn't need anyone else to sound good.  THE END.         "

372,Capricorn,"       Listening to: Idioteque - Radiohead  -  This week has been a joke, nothing more.  All the teachers as scrambling to finish a unit before WASL, in which we will forget everything we have learned.  Easy week, filled with movies (October Sky, Beauty and the Beast and Babe en espanol, Gattaca, and that frustratingly dramatic Julius Caesar we all love!), annoyingly boring WASL prep, and neat 50's tune's in Cranny's class that I haven't heard in awhile.  Just another excuse to get my groove on in History.  That groove and good spirit carried over to English, where Mrs. Klaas crushed it into the ground.  She is the only woman I know who is evil enough to destroy the good feeling I get from 50's music.  Damn her, she's inhuman!  -  After school, I checked out Room 210, where Mr. Allen confessed to have missinformed me about a meeting which is next friday.  So I walked to Gramms' house.  -  We took Bridget to the Pet Wash where, like always, my allergies attack in full force.  Not fun.  Bridget looks cute now, though still really fat.  -  Afterwards, psycho grandmum was conviced we needed to get her new computer tonight, even though I was really freaken' tired from washing that damn dog.  Whatever, I got Wendy's and Kill Bill out of the deal.  Win win.  Plus I got rid of that damn Wal-Mart gift certificate that has been haunting my wallet since Christmas.  -  I need to try and get some more sleep.  I may or may not be seeing Kill Bill Volume 2 tomorrow, but I will see it one way or another.     "
373,Capricorn,"             I finally got around to uploading the pictures from my digitial camera to my computer. Most of the ones I'm about to post here are from a trip to a waterpark somewhere in the southern/middle portion of Taiwan, which was the only time I left Taipei during the summer (except of course, to go to Japan). The two people with me are the college students that pretty much took me around and kept me company since I can't read the language and probably would have gotten myself killed had I tried to wander around on my own, plus it would have been extremely boring without company around my age.

374,Capricorn,"           This weekend went by so fast.  I can't believe it is time to go back to work tomorrow.  =(  I'm not ready to go damn it!  I have spent most of my weekend with my Mom since my Dad is outta town visiting his mom in Fld.  I didn't really do much but visit, eat, (she cooked for me!!) and wash my car.    Till next time.  PS.  Divine I need some help with this blogspot stuff.  Can you help me?!?!                "
375,Virgo,"               Weel, today.  What to say about today?   I got up, I got dressed, I went to work.  I got annoyed because it was busy and I was trying to do reductions on the chilled foods and Jean kept ringing her bell for assistance on the checkouts, and OF COURSE, I am the ONLY person that can POSSIBLY go on the tills.  It's infuriating.  It took me nearly two hours to finish them.  I had my lunch then, then Bob decided he was going to spring my progress review on me.  Ok so he did warn me last week when he gave me the booklet to read through and fill in, just that I hadn't got around to actually doing it yet.  It was a waste of time anyway, the usual, 'how do you think you're doing?', 'what can we do to make your life easier?' rubbish.  It makes no difference to how the shop works.  Anyway, Bob has put a couple of things down that I might get training for...well I say training...it's more like here you go, do this, you'll work it out eventually.   After work I went to the pictures with Pete, saw King Arthur.  I liked it, but Pete kept grumping about innacurate bits of history, and the lack of character in some of the characters.  I do have to say that Ray Winston's character, well it's a good character, but he's a little bit too Ray Winston, if you know what I mean?   Pete's a bit of a history geek, like the way I'm a rock geek...it's all good, history is more interesting to more people than rocks, and I like listening to him talk about it (but don't tell him I said that ;-)  ).  I still haven't told my mum and dad that I'm seeing Pete again.  To be homest I think maybe my mum has guessed, or at least suspects, but she hasn't asked.  They don't ask who I've been out with when I go out so what do they expect if I don't tell them stuff?  I will mention it soon though.   After the cinema we went to the pub, The Cherry Orchard, in Arrowe Park.  It's a nice pub, usually quiet, and it's right on the edge of the park, so it's good for night time walks.  The food isn't bad either.   I came home, had some weetabix, watched Poltergeist 3 because my dad was hogging the computer, wished I hadn't because it is a truly dreadful film, the best bit is laughing at the scary eighties haircuts and huge padded shoulders.   Well I came on here and read  urlLink my best mate's blog  for today, then, well I'm writing mine now.  It could have been a more interesting day, and easily a more boring one.  I really do need another job though.  Must make an effort.  Tomorrow I will look on the internet and see if I can find some suitable ones that I can apply for.          "
376,Aries,           I just think they look cool. *shuffle*          
377,Virgo,"       Well, I got a call from the mural organizer who asked if the tiles would be ready to view tomorrow.  Of course, I hadn't even re-fired the tiles yet, or done the two 'dog paw' accents, or the tile that no one wanted to paint, or the stupid 4 tile center.  So I had to fess up, and beg for more time.  Of course, now that my rear is on the line, I managed to become amazingly inspired and finish the two accent tiles while my kids got ready for school.  I cancelled a doctor's appointment, and painted the stupid center.  Not perfect and beautiful like the last one, but it's there at least.  Now the dilemma of how lazy do I want to be?  Should I leave it black and white, or color it in, and if I color it in, how much color should I bother with?  Or is it passable as it is?  Mostly, I just fear total failure like the last time.           "
378,Scorpio,"       did you know that the snow is blue at  midnight? People don't know how I see a darkness that  is  never there, and  hear voices.  but these voices are real, they  are echoes of what I've already heard.  If I went...  they'd  stop. go ahead, psychoanylize me. God help me. Angels watch over me.    "
379,Aquarius,"                  Tropical Adventures of the Fab Four Day #5   Yesterday was a nice relaxing day thanks to Kurt and his sunburn! He was not interested in going to the beach again so we hung out here for most of the day. He and Ked worked on pasting together 11 of Kurt's panoramic photos from Alaska and then they worked on getting Kurt & Michelle each set up with their own blogs. Michelle & I decided that the boys were boring, so we headed down to the pool for a couple hours and had a fabulous time chatting and working on our tans!  Later in the afternoon we headed out to see Van Helsing. It was kinda scary!! But it was good, and Hugh Jackman always does a great job. After the movie we headed over to Bucca Di Beppo's for some giant pizza!! It was delicious! Then Kurt insisted we run through Target (because he misses them so much! ha!) for some aloe lotion for his sunburn. Then we headed back to our place and vegged some more. Actually, we watched ramp on TV. It was hilarious because the movie is so old and the sound effects were cheesy. They used the same sound for a gunshot as they did for a missile. I think we had more fun making fun of the movie than actually watching it.  Anyway, today is their last day here and I think we're taking it easy again today!                  "
380,Scorpio,"       I told my chemistry teacher that I haven't been sleeping much lately, and she was like, ' Rachel, that's bad!.  It's only the third week of school, and if you're already so stressed out that you can't sleep... you need help.  You need to go take a yoga class or something... and learn how to sleep at night.'  I think I really am stressed out.  List of things I need to remember/have to deal with: Chemistry test tomorrow Latin test Monday Photo Editor Duties -shoot center spread pictures...  how do I get parents checking up on their kids if I can't use my friends?? -shoot my photo column -shoot internet piracy/are you addicted to the internet pictures -collect photo assignment sheets -keep track of what film goes where -keep track of who's shooting what story -make sure pictures are decent -scan all pictures into the computer -become queen of photoshop -make film canister labels continuing on... Church Duties -Thursday night rehearsals for cantoring -youth group -youth minister hiring committee -lector/eucharistic minister... {crap  I have to go to a retraining session tomorrow night!} -volunteer babysitter every tuesday night. -liturgy planning piano lessons every Monday night practice piano at least 30 min a day {YEAH RIGHT!!!!!} an average of 2-3 hours of homework every night does my car have gas? ...if I make the play {fingers crossed, but not getting hopes up} PSAT prep class darkroom class? ...friends {aka sanity} family {ack!} eat/sleep  {Heh, heh} liturgy planning committee at school {Where do I find TRACY HADEN?????} um...

I think I'm a little overbooked, what about you?  oh... and I forgot stuff like  HAVING A LIFE!!!!!!  and also add to that the fact that I memorized a 1min 30sec monologue over night monday... I'm meeting Allison during my free tomorrow to go through the newspapers negatives from last year... club registration is Friday, and I want to be president of Photography club I need to figure out what I'm wearing to Cindy's wedding... {I'm doing the guest book!} homecoming is in four weeks...

381,Cancer,"        Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  I'm beggin' of you please don't take my man   It flitted through my mind for some reason the other day how much I have always liked Dolly Parton, yet don't listen to her unless she happens to be on the TV or the radio.  Of course, since I don't listen to country radio that doesn't happen.  She was on Jay Leno tonight and it reminded me that I really should start listening to her more.  Anyone who knows me knows that while I am NOT a fan of country music, my tastes are very diverse.  I won't exclude (thanks, D) anyone simply due to the genre of music they are in.  There is country that I like.  I love bluegrass, the blues, gospel and good old rock and roll.   I could go on listing but you get the idea.  Everything from Rachmaninoff to Rammstein.  However, there are many musicians who slip through the cracks of my mind.  Last week, there was a tune niggling at the back of my head.  It teased me and teased me for days on end.  Finally, one night I wracked my brain and finally managed to get hold of it.  It's a great 80s hit that has a timeless appeal.  Go  urlLink here  to check out the tune (click on Sound Library/Video clips) or  urlLink here  for the lyrics to Billy Vera and the Beaters 'At This Moment'.           "
382,Capricorn,"                 I forgot to mention how much I liked the music for Reagan's funeral. There was a piece at the beginning to the tune of  Jerusalem , I didn't think it had the same words, but I could be mistaken. And at the end, when the casket was being taken out, there was a piece that was absolutely haunting. I'm not sure what it was, but it was very appropriate.       "

384,Virgo,"        On Drugs....  Other than the fact that I do actually spend some time on drugs, my intent is more to bitch about how it can be a pain in the ass to actually GET on drugs.  Me n my main squeeze were tryin to get the eagle to land as it has many times in the past without incident.....this time, was different.  Usually, the eagle lands with the timing and smooth style of an 35 year old whop walking into a cheerleading camp, but this time our eagle had....well, it had its wings clipped, and what follows are the trials and perils of getting the eagle to land in the land of the wicked.   5:15: The escape  With the eagle on my mind (as it has been for a couple of days) I slip out of work like a ninja in the dark....my destination.....the bravo extraction point...my mission....to attain the eagle.   5:45 The Dirt Bike Kid  So, with my mind contently resting on the eagle, I proceed with my mission...heading due north...making good time (on the motorcycle so traffic couldn't stop this ninja) when the Dirk Bike Kid enters.  There was an eruption of sound and vibration coming from my pocket (no, I wasn't getting horney) that failed to stop.  I pulled over I was so distracted....to my surprise, it was the dirt bike kid going fucken crazy bout how I had to call him STAT.....this doesn't bode well as I am on a mission of the ut most importance......   5:47 Indecent proposal  After a bit of fumbling around, I was able to get to the bottom of the Dirt Bike Kid's agenda.....he needed a helping hand in moving some shit out of his girlfriend's house.  As you can imagine, this goes against every fiber of my mission, and even more fucked up, its the last damn thing on earth I felt like doing....but, being the push over that I am, I opted to help my homie in need....I figure....what goes around comes around...if I help this guy...the eagle is sure to land!   7:00 The bullshit has gone on long enough  Upon completing of the deed (moving big shit from girls house to second story storage level unit.  Argh!), the gory details of which I will spare you, I had a dry mouth, a headache, and no eagle in sight.   7:45 The realization  Realizing that we may have to spend our labor day weekend in an eagle vacuum, panic set in.  My mind wanders to the possibility that I may need to circumvent normal eagle protocol, and try something 'outside the box' to fix this bind!  Allz I can say is, thank God for the quick thinking mind of a little lovely named Don Hollironi...The don pool resources...phone callz were made.....and shit was happening.....we were on the trail of an eagle landing....fucken finally!!!   9:30 We gotta go where?  So, our new eagle landing required some re-allocation of manpower...to make this happen, one ninja had to do some flying, magic babysitting whilst ninja #2 took the mole to the landing strip, which was ass far, and took all kindz of time....   10:30 Back to base  After all the bullshit...all the hoops....the eagle had finally landed.....allz I can say is....fucken A.  So that's my story......long...drawn....but true....and man...it was worth it!    "
385,Sagittarius,"       Pick a president and be  urlLink smart  when you do it.    I've seen this on so many blogs today, that it must be the way to go.  Show me your results and I'll show you mine ;)  Diva out.         "
386,Capricorn,"                 The President is getting a ton of abuse by those who disagree with him. People say he could have prevented 9/11, and say he takes womens rights away by preventing partial birth abortion, and takes away the rights of homosexuals by being against their right to marriage. The media protrays him in the darkest light it can. His opponent, John Kerry, abuses his intelligence and everything else about him. These people may disagree with him but does that mean that they should demean him so harshly with their language? The President of the United States of America, whoever he may be, deserves respect for at least two reasons.  One , he was voted into office by the people. That means that over half of America wants this man to be president. That deserves respect.  Two , the job of President is a tough one. It's even tougher when there's such an abusive media. It's even tougher when there's been a large terrorist attack on your country. It's even tougher when there's a war going on. Any President who demonstrates a desire to do what is right and best for his country despite the conquences, should be respected, because no matter if we disagree with him, he's doing what he's doing for our good. However the media seems two disregard, if not totally forget these points. If our President next term is John Kerry than he too deserves respect for the two above reasons, and he should get that respect even if he does not return it to the unborn children of America. It is ironic that the liberals who so passionately preach tolerence also so passionately abuse a man like President Bush who had done little to deserve it. President Bush has never been heard demeaning Clinton, who came before him and un- doubtedly made his job harder for him.      "

Then lie again and again? Or fill the questions with answers That I’ve tried to hide in vain.   UNTITLED   (1998)   Why does it hurt so badly? Living a life so empty …all alone …with no one to care but my own.  Why do I crave for something Even I cannot explain …unseen …yet I feel the urge to have.  Why am I what I am? Afraid to admit what I feel …puzzled, confused …uncertain that this really is LOVE.   SACRIFICE   (1996)   How can I smile again?      When all I feel is pain?      Go on and say nothing’s wrong      When it isn’t me you belong?  Where else could I turn to?      When all the doors lock up      And the friends I have says no      Who else could make me laugh?  The thought of survival kills      But I have to;  I must live      An empty life and nightly chills      With endurance, your freedom I give.   EDIFICE   (1996)   The sun’s about to set     Darkness envelops the blueness of the sky I stood there, waiting……     Yet you didn’t come.  The next day, at dusk I returned     Waited till my eyes could no longer contain Hoping at least you’d remember     A five-year-old pledge we made here.  Our rendezvous is my witness     Of a love unshattered and patient I shall come again and again     In this edifice --- till you remember.   ASS   (1997)   There he sat silently on his fave bench    He wants to think        But million thoughts preoccupy him.  He tried to talk with Martha     But she didn’t seem to care a bit        He took out a cigarette and silently smoked.  The memories came flashing    The nightmare’s back        But he could hide no more  He should have been a lawyer now    No, a doctor maybe        .……yes, he lost his gold.  Yesterday couldn’t be pulled back    Everything wasted was wasted        Regrets won’t make any difference  Slowly he got up    Headed unto nowhere, no more Martha        Yes, the fool realized what a fool he was!   SORRY….   (1997)   As tears rolled down her cheeks, You uttered the word you thought could heal SORRY.  SORRY… You thought it was some kind of medicine That could wash away the pain That could stop her tears from falling.  Your SORRY shattered her dreams Broke her heart into pieces Yet she still loves you And have forgiven you.  You may be happy now with someone else, But you could never tell if someday You’d come to hear the word you once said …. SORRY.   THE DREAMER IN ME   (1998)   I used to see nothing but rainbows      A blue and sunny sky      Cheerful faces to pacify      Unprepared for the sorrows to come  Yet now I stand in this empty room      Alone, shattered and immune      Don’t know how to move with the tune      Feeling that my life’s in a doom       I tried to retrieve past memories      And can’t help the tears from falling      Over mistakes and failures I gained      Hidden behind my sweet smile.  The dreamer in me is dead      Tired, broken and hopeless      Nothing that I did is good      And there’s no sense in dreaming once more.   FOOL THAT I AM   (1998)   I had you in my heart My arms could have pulled you close Touched you, cuddled sweetly I would have ----- yet I let you go.  I denied I was in love Ignored the feeling inside Didn’t believe that you love me too Yet now, yet now I miss you so.  If only I could pull back the years Hold you and say I do That I always longed for your touch But I could not.  Accept I must this fact Though It hurts a lot We once shared something mutual that’s so special And if we’re meant to share it once more, time can only tell…   I AM WHO I AM   (1998)   This is me Indefinable, unpredictable Obscure Vague.  I am me Cheerful, outgoing, moody Full of dreams in life Simply human.  Just another….. Dreamer. Sometimes I stumble But I get up with dignity. Loser. Oftentimes I lost yet I gain something better.  This is me. I am me. Just another being. Yes, I am who I am.   UNSPOKEN LOVE   ( 1999 – for viki)   She have been bombarded with childhood nightmares No family to claim her own, no loving mother to hug her so… Her body was restless with work And her heart was filled with hatred.  She looked for the missing piece everywhere The love she had been longing to share Men came and went in her life Still, she felt empty inside.  She settled with someone who loved her much Yet she failed to hold the love she grasped It slipped and dripped like sand Abandoned once more, her fate was out of her hand.  Tough as she is, she stood firm Fought the battle and hoped to win She may have lost in many battles But still, she continued her struggle.  Now, as she strives to live the life she’s destined to have I just want her to know that she’s not alone --- never We’ve always been here (with God) from the start Though we don’t say it much I hope she knows How much we love her so.  We take great pride in her strength The undying hope and endurance she possess All these and more are her wealth Which no one else could have.  She has always been our empress in shining armor Always ready to defend us from harm The superwoman of our lives Yes, we’re very proud of our  mom.    FOR ONCE   (2000)   For once in my life I’ve cared for someone For once I’ve cried when love has gone The pain, the memories, lessons learned and time wasted The feelings that still linger filled me with hatred.  I tried to sleep on it, forget his face  And trash his image I tried to bury the love in anger Hoping I would somehow grow in age  With my life’s high and low, The bitterness I gained still show I thought I learned my lesson well But no, I can never tell.  For here I am again Loving right after losing….. Ready for another strike of pain Waiting what love’s gonna bring.  For once in my life I got hurt For once I recovered and stood up I may not have learned enough But I’m glad I still have a heart.   IT’S US, REMEMBER?   (2002)   It was I who wept when you said you failed As I looked into your sad eyes, the pain stayed It was I who assured you that all you have to do is go on That life is full of twists and turns Sometimes you get along, oftentimes you don’t So you need to be strong in order to hold on You looked at me with eyes full of hope And I knew then that you could cope.  It was you who lifted up my spirits Made me feel good and very special It was you whom I held hands and walked with Whose lips I kissed with so much warmth As you whispered how much you love me That it’s more than I could see All I could do was hug you tight Coz I couldn’t ask for more.  It was us who dreamed a happy life together Nice home, good kids ---- a perfect family We believed everything stays well forever And promised to keep the vow of matrimony It was us who have passed lots of trials Of individual differences we’ve learned to overcome Why turn your back now that we’ve gone this far? Why leave me alone when you made me believe it was us? It’s always been you and me from the start Can’t it still be us?   THE MAN I TAUGHT MY HEART TO LOVE   (1993)   The man I taught my heart to love A man intelligent and smart All the good traits he must have To be nearer to my heart  A man who’s understanding enough Fill up all my needs and lack ‘Cause sometimes I’m not that tough All I can do is mock.  A man who is very religious A man who’ll bring me near to God  Teach me not to be loquacious Who’ll cheer me up when I’m sad.  A man who’s handsome in my eyes Even if they say that I’m that blind Someone who’s so nice A man who’ll enlighten up my mind.  A man who must be older than me A year or two or three So my mistakes he can see A man who’ll love me free.  This man I’ve already found A kind so few But all of a sudden he was gone The man I taught my heart to love… Is no other than YOU!   THE CURSE OF LIFE ~   (1999)   Life’s curse hits you when you’re down It’s there when you fail When you are dumped It hits you hard that you can’t stand up It cripples your soul Make you feel numb inside It lingers long till you cram up It manipulates the way you live Let you go where you should not It drives you mad of causes you know not It brings out unanswerable questions The cause of uncontrollable emotions It pushes you to do things you should have thought twice It seems to rule you although it does not It does not exist though you chose to believe it does It is a fiction you created to make life an exciting struggle.   That Thing Called...   (1999)   LOVE is something that comes and goes overnight Sometimes it lingers, sometimes it does not. It is a feeling that drives you to act And it can be an act that can give feeling to your heart.  LOVE may not be felt at all times But it can be given through our acts It is the conscience that dictates us And make us feel good inside  LOVE comes in various masks I have mine and you have your own match. It’s just a matter of preparation and trust. The day would come at last.  LOVE is sacrificing your own interest for other’s happiness. It is giving up what you like the most. And setting free at no cost Yes, love is there when you let go.   ONLY A BEGINNING   (1994 – for IV-Newton batch ’94)   It hurts to see you go But what can I do? I don’t have the right to stop you. You’ve done it well, my friend.  You’re now in line with the so-called graduates Which everyone thinks is the end But dear, do remember Graduation only serves as a beginning.  You’ve only ended light endeavors Heavy ones are still ahead Be prepared and do your best Fight, and make it to the fullest.  A little patience is only needed What you sow is what you’ll reap Your goals in life will soon be real And your dreams won’t remain as dreams.  Just don’t forget to ask God’s help Make way to your struggle I hope to see you soon marching on success For the completion of once a quest.   It Could Be You ~   (1999)   An empty mind came overflowing A numb heart started to feel something Yours is the name that awakens Yours are the eyes tat weakens...  These conflicting emotions arouse confusion Yet I embrace it with conviction It's infrequent and unusual, truly extraordinary A burden I struggle to carry.  In time we'll know all the answers And learn to accept the consequences it bears Take time to stop awhile and think of me Try to imagine if we could ever be.  We're both aware of what we feel  There's something within us that we could be real It could be you who'll end the quest Coz I've found, who for me, is the best.   Silly Heart   (1994)   I'm not sure if I do But he's sure he does I don't know if this feeling's for real But I know how he feels.  What will I do? Could I just stay and pretend? Or will I just ignore? To escape from pains and heartaches?  I feel something inside But i'm not sure what it was And if I'll enter this game I'll be at the losing end.  Everybody's against.... How could I bear such consequences? How could I face asking faces? I'm not sire I can.  “C'mon, try it” my heart says Although trying never harms My mind still never dared try And was contented in giving out a silent sigh.  I'm very much confused I feel like crying I feel like I'm about to give up Now, tell me, what shall I do next?   We Care   (1995)   When problem s beset you ...and you feel you're about to give up hold on...be tough Remember, God cares.  When you're so down and helpless ...and the path you're heading seems rough just smile...take it easy Remember, I'm here.  When friends turn their backs on you ...and your hope seems to drift Don't be lost... keep on striving Who knows, success is only half a mile away?  Don't say you're all alone... don't think you're forsaken don't lose hope... don't lose faith Remember, we both care.          "
389,Gemini,"                 Slept in today.  It was nice, I like the fact I get to do it tomorrow too.  Yes, Mikey does not have work tomorrow either.  I do, however only have 3 days left living at this house.  Well, for 5 weeks anyways.  Sunday (,bloody sunday) I leave for Governor's School.  Sorry for the U2 reference there. Went to a surprise birthday part for one of the guys that goes to my church tonite.  Gary is turning 50, and Roy is turning 47 (I think) on the same day.  So, Gary was told that we were having a surprise party for Roy.  The party was in fact for him.  So, when Roy came in we all yelled surprise.  Roy said 'Where in the Hell is Gary?', saw him and was like 'Gotcha!'.  It was quite funny.  Gary is kinda balding, and his entire head got really red.  I was laughing as I told Mitch, his son, that it must be nice to have nothing better to do than plan this kind of thing.  The party wasn't to bad.  Mum has to be at like 3:30 tomorrow, so we didn't stay the whole time.  I also had to call Brian to see what was going on in the way of work for me.   My Avenged Sevenfold cd won't burn.  Well, I have yet to get it to burn.  This time I am making a completely legal copy of a cd I own, so as it does not get ruined.  I have already killed two of my cds because of the cases in the Blazer.  I have them ripped on here so, its all good.  This one, however, is being a wanker about things.     Oh, and Thanks Jenn.  I told her to check out my blog and leave a comment.  I am assuming she left the anonymous comment telling me that 'there is no s in decided'.

I realize that you know absolutely nothing about me since even before you ran away the first time.&nbsp; You had thought that I was so wholesome—but I could share a few of my nightmares with you.&nbsp; I think, arrogantly, that I had many experiences similar to yours.&nbsp; I want desperately to tell you about them, but I have been told time and time again that I talk too much and don’t listen enough.&nbsp; But there is so much to say!&nbsp; There is eight years of catching up to do!&nbsp; I console myself by saying that you need to know everything—that by knowing about me, I can somehow help you.&nbsp; Do you even need help anymore?&nbsp; I am afraid to ask certain questions—I am afraid of upsetting you—and then I realize that when I think about you, I am thinking both of the way you looked the last time I saw you (you were fifteen or sixteen?), and then I am mostly thinking of a child Duk Sook: when you were seven, eight, maybe even as old as twelve.&nbsp; And if I had asked you these questions as a child, you would have been furious (I think).&nbsp; Do I really know anything about you?&nbsp; I feel that I should, since we have known each other since we were four years old.&nbsp; Or was everything from when we were kids a façade?&nbsp; I am angry with you for leaving me.&nbsp; You were supposed to be the one I depended on, you were supposed to depend on me.&nbsp; And you didn’t.&nbsp; You walked out.&nbsp; I wonder how many of my experiences occurred because of your absence.&nbsp; How maybe I kept trying to fill the void that you had created, trying to have other friends that were like you, and then only ended up hurting myself in the process.&nbsp; No one could replace you, even though I wanted them to.&nbsp; The girl I tried to replace you with betrayed and hurt me worse than you did.&nbsp; I have since been afraid of woman and the way they seem to dupe me time and again. * * * There is a little Asian woman who is at my second bus stop every morning.&nbsp; She is small, and old and wrinkled, and moves with such precision and grace and curiosity.&nbsp; I don’t know her.&nbsp; But I want to imagine that she is your grandmother.&nbsp; That she holds you in her arms and serves you tea.&nbsp; That she brushes your hair and braids it and serves you platters of meaningful food.&nbsp; She teaches you all about Korea.&nbsp; She makes you proud to be who you are.&nbsp; She fixes your hurts and makes it okay for you to also be American. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am imagining that your adoptive parents, Toni and Tom, were cruel to you, that you were treated like a Cinderella-slave-girl.&nbsp; I am very angry at them—at the quiet, immaculate house, the precision, the fear of germs, the never-ending rolls of toilet paper for sneezes, how incompatible it seemed with children.&nbsp; I am blaming your lack of exposure to G.I. Joe and Smurf cartoons.&nbsp; I am thinking not enough TV and not enough candy.&nbsp; Not enough laughing and not enough cuddling.&nbsp; Not enough talking and not enough of the right type of arguing.&nbsp; Not enough dress-up dolls, and not enough of what you wanted.&nbsp; I still believe you never wanted to dance and never wanted to play the violin.&nbsp; If she hadn’t already scared it out of you, Toni would have straightened your voice out too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did she think was wrong with you?&nbsp; I thought you were perfect.&nbsp; I thought every word that came out of your mouth was funny and right.&nbsp; Except when you gave me back that best-friend necklace because Toni said that you weren’t allowed to have just one best friend.&nbsp; That was the worst thing you ever told me.&nbsp; You broke my heart.&nbsp; Did your “mother’s” words break your heart too, because you were forced to turn me away?&nbsp; Or were you already pulling yourself away and believed your mother’s lies? &nbsp;DAMN!!&nbsp; It’s so easy to write “your mother”, but I don’t know if I believe that she really is your mother.&nbsp; Do you still talk to Toni and Tom?&nbsp; Do you love them?&nbsp; Or do you resent them?&nbsp; Do you have anyone whom you can call family?&nbsp; I have heard rumors that you are living in Nebraska with cousins, aunts and uncles from Toni’s side.&nbsp; Do you love them?&nbsp; Or do you hate them because they don’t have your blood?&nbsp; Will you ever love anyone? àI am now positive that your “mother’s” refusal to let you be “best friends” with me had a tremendous effect on the road that you went down.&nbsp; I want to think that our forced separation, your lack of me, made it impossible for you to function: that you needed me so much that you shut down without me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are in Nebraska, what is it like?&nbsp; How does it compare to California?&nbsp; To Sonoma?&nbsp; There must not be a lot of hills.&nbsp; This would bother me.&nbsp; I would never be able to get used to that.&nbsp; I wouldn’t feel safe.&nbsp; I need hills; growing up in Sonoma Valley made them a necessary part of my life.&nbsp; Do you feel the same way?&nbsp; I want you to, since you grew up next to one of the most beautiful hills in Sonoma. * * * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes it’s as if you are dead.&nbsp; And then I realize that I am mourning for you as if you really are.&nbsp; I think I know deep down that I will never see you again.&nbsp; Or else I am not allowing myself to hope against hope that I will see you again.&nbsp; I don’t want to set myself up for another failure.&nbsp; I don’t want to wish for you and then lose you all over again.&nbsp; That’s why my throat hurts—because I am still waiting for your funeral.&nbsp; Because one day you were there, and the next you weren’t.&nbsp; All I got was a letter while I was away at adventure/survival camp just after I had turned sixteen.&nbsp; A small envelope with the desperate words of my mother:&nbsp; “Say a prayer for Ducky.&nbsp; She has run away.”&nbsp; That was all I got: the only announcement of our separation.&nbsp; They were strange, unfriendly words on peach stationary, trying to hide behind my mother’s small, beautiful script—harsh words that made my eyes blink over and over.&nbsp; Even though I thought I had given up God and prayer, I prayed for you every single night that I was at camp—when I was backpacking thirty miles to the ocean, when I was huddled alone next to the Eel River in the middle of the night.&nbsp; I never stopped wondering where you were, where you had gone off to, what possibly had gotten into your head.&nbsp; This was years before I got your letter explaining it all, and I had no idea what was going on.&nbsp; It was as if my eight-year-old best friend has run away without reason.&nbsp; I have only seen you once since then, that brief morning at St. Leo’s Church, where I had you again for less than an hour, where I held you tight and cried with gratitude that I had found you.&nbsp; I cried too much—my &nbsp;tears blurred you and washed you away; so far away I have no idea where you are now.&nbsp; I didn’t know my tears were quite so powerful.&nbsp; I shouldn’t have cried so much.&nbsp; I hate you for being so fragile that you let yourself be washed away.&nbsp; I love you for trying to save yourself, for knowing that you had to get out. 6:07 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am back on the bus, now on my way home after school.&nbsp; I have been writing to you all day.&nbsp; I have barely paid attention in class because of you.&nbsp; It’s funny—you affect my life even though you don’t exist anymore. &nbsp;I wonder if you have gone to college, if you are in college right now, or if you have lost too many precious years.&nbsp;&nbsp;        "

395,Virgo,"               I am not a happy bunny.  I'm not sleeping well at the moment for various reasons, and the sleepless nights are making me grumpy.  Today in work I have been patronised, prodded, been made to feel like an idiot, thought of as an idiot, oh and I had my arse pinched by some pervy man.  I'd have slapped him, but I wasn't quick enough, and slapping customers isn't good for business.  Anyway, today I hate my job.  Sometimes I like it, but today, today if I had had the opportunity I'd have burnt the place to the ground just to get a few months off while they rebuilt it, I'd have handed in my notice if I had the money or prospects to do so, but I haven't so I didn't.  Tomorrow doesn't look like being much bettee either.  It's delivery day.   I was going to go to the pub after work, but no-one could make it.  I was even thinking of going on my own, but when it came to getting off the bus, I just didn't have the energy, so I came home and fell asleep for a couple of hours instead.  It did me good, I feel more refreshed and awake now, and a million times less grumpy, so I think it was probably a better idea than going to the pub.  Lets face it, drinking on your own is never a good idea, and I'd have only ended up getting drunk on my own, and wouldn't have got any sleep tonight either.  I'm still yawning tho, hopefully that means I'll sleep properly tonight and I'll be bright eyed and bushy tailed tomorrow morning, like those bunnies I mentioned...          "

398,Capricorn,"                 I sometimes hear (and read) Christians criticize the Renaissance as a humanistic time, and a time with much secularism. There surely  were  some secular ideas and things that started in the Renaissance, but I think we sometimes carry it too far. I think it could be argued that without the Renaissance the Reformation would never have occurred, or, at least, it would not have had the impact or following that it did. First of all, the development of the printing press greatly helped to spread the written word to all classes of life, rather than just the wealthy. More people had access to the gospel, and they could read God’s Word for themselves, rather than always relying on the church to tell and interpret it for them. And as the history of Christianity progressed, so did its temporal power. And at the dawn of the Reformation many of the clergy paid more attention do the demands of their purse than the demands of God’s law. Another effect of the development of the printing press was that the Greek and Roman classics were being discovered again, and people desired to read them in their original language. That idea was also carried into the church, and many scholars started to read the Bible in Greek and Hebrew, and saw the difference from what the church, at the time, was teaching and practicing, and what God’s word actually said. The Renaissance also brought a general thirst for learning and the printing press made it more widely available. Again, this thirst was carried into the Church, and without it, perhaps the Reformation would have had less of a following. I will also note that though some secular ideas  did  start to develop in the Renaissance, it certainly is not in anyway to the extent of the way secular ideas dominate today’s culture. There was still a strong sense of morality, and even Cosimo de’ Medici, a very learned, wealthy, and influential citizen of Florence, said, after donating an extremely large sum of money to a monastery, “Never shall I be able to give God enough to set him down in my books as a debtor.” This man asked only in return for what he had given, that the monks let him have the use of a cell for reflection. Not to mention Lorenzo Valla, who wrote,  On Free Will , which is about God’s sovereignty and our free will, and who was one of two men whom Luther said most influenced his ideas. Of course, it is only God who knows men’s hearts, but I think that there were many godly things and people in the Renaissance, and I feel privileged to study it from a Christian perspective.       "

402,Sagittarius,"       This was an article which I had read a few weeks ago....thought it kindof makes sense to me....actually lot more sense to me now...  'A person is limited only by the thoughts that he chooses.'  You are not limited to the life you now live. It has been accepted by you as the best you can do at this moment. Any time you're ready to go beyond the limitations currently in your life, you're capable of doing that by choosing different thoughts.  We each earn the income we do today because that is the amount we have limited ourselves to earn. We could easily earn 5, 10, 20 times more if we did not limit ourselves through the thoughts we maintain. Don't believe that's true? Surely you know people who earn much more than you who don't have your education, your skills, or your intelligence. So why do they earn more than you?  I love the story of George Dantzig that Cynthia Kersey wrote about in Unstoppable. As a college student, George studied very hard and always late  into the night. So late that he overslept one morning, arriving 20 minutes late for class. He quickly copied the two math problems on the board, assuming they were the homework assignment. It took him several days to work through the two problems, but finally he had a breakthrough and dropped the homework on the professor's desk the next day. Later, on a Sunday morning, George was awakened at 6 a.m. by his excited professor. Since George was late for class, he hadn't heard the professor announce that the two unsolvable equations on the board were mathematical  mind teasers that even Einstein hadn't been able to answer. But George Dantzig, working without any thoughts of limitation, had solved not one, but two problems that had stumped mathematicians for thousands of  years. Simply put, George solved the problems because he didn't know he couldn't.  Bob Proctor tells us to 'keep reminding yourself that you have tremendous reservoirs of potential within you, and therefore you are quite capable of doing anything you set your mind to”. All you must do is figure out how you can do it, not whether or not you can. And once you have made your mind up to do it, it's amazing how your mind  begins to figure out how.' And that's worth thinking about.          "

404,Aquarius,"       I was strolling through B&N one day and noticed that in the SAT prep section there were new materials, which were not part of my SAT study path.  I had a tinge of jealousy seeing 'SAT word' novels on the shelf.  The titles like BUSTED and HEAD OVER HEELS accompanied cheesy cover art and promised stories of love and mystery among high school students.  These 'novels' are written around common vocab. words found on the SAT and those words even appear in bold type within the text.  I was jealous because even though I have a BA in English Lang. and Lit. and love to read, I hated and struggled with reading throughout elementary, middle and high school.    My majoring in English was a surprise even to myself because I entered college loathing reading and writing.  I even went to the writing center on campus to get assistance with my early college papers and I would come out knowing I had much work ahead of me.  I was originally going to major in Psychology thinking that I needed this background for teaching.  But, my heart was never in Psychology and when one of the best professors I ever had gave me a C, it pushed me to make a change.    He was one of the best professors, not because of his teaching, but because of our talks during my office visits.  I went to him often for help because I was failing his class.  He became my friend and gave me guidance.  I learned about his family and his struggles in college and he helped me see that my world was not, in fact, collapsing around me.  We didn't talk much about the class I was taking from him, these were more like therapy sessions.  The strange thing about his role in my life that semester (and even later when I would go and visit with him) is that his specialty was in learning and cognition and he worked primarily with mice.  He wasn't trained for the sessions we had and when he handed me chemwipes as I cried during my first visit, I knew he would be my friend.    After a few sessions in his office, the semester was ending and it was time for the final exam.  I rocked the socks off of my final, but he still gave me a C for the course, I was one point away from a B- and passing the class.  I was heartbroken and felt betrayed. When I went to see him after winter break to discuss my grade, he didn't flinch although he had previously and quietly said he would help me if I made a good enough grade on the final.  I left his office quietly and quickly that day, there was no therapy session to work me through this one and I wasn't that upset, surprisingly.  He knew what he was doing; he knew my heart was not in Psychology.  With the threat of having to retake that Psychology class to finish the major looming in the distance, I went on with my other classes.  While studying THE EPIC OF GILAMESH for an anthropology class with a friend, I realized I had to change my major.  I loved the analysis of psychology, but I hated the science of it.  English, this is where I could find the analysis I craved without any science to confuse my brain.  I crammed every English class available into my schedule.  I stuck to mostly poetry classes as I thought this was my passion.  I think part of me really liked how short poems where.  I was still a little afraid of all that reading.  But, I couldn't avoid it forever and I'm so glad that I had to read books like A RAISIN IN THE SUN, AS I LAY DYING, DROWN, NATIVE SON, CYMBELINE, THE COLOR PURPLE, and THE BLUEST EYE.    I wasn't the best at reading all the assigned readings.  'Sir Gawain' and Chaucer didn't excite me and there were Colonial American passages that put me to sleep, literally.  I still struggle with my love/ hate relationship with reading.  I wish I were voracious at it.  I think it's partly that it takes time for stories to unfold.  I wish I could finish books in one sitting like a movie, but I read slowly.  I read every word and say each one silently in my head.  I know there are speed-reading methods, but I don't want to skip over words, I just wish I could read every word, faster.    A few years ago, I started a book journal where I write character maps and synopses of the books I read.  It's an idea from my 10th grade English teacher and I find it good for me.  I have physical proof that I've read a book and it jogs my memory if I can't remember a plot line or character details.  In the beginning of the journal I noted words I needed to look up, big words not in my daily vocab.  This lasted for about 3 books (OK just 1 really) and then the words I didn't know disappeared from the entries as if I've mastered the English Lang.  Hardly, I just got lazy, realizing I probably would never use or see those big words again and just began to skim over them.  But, sometimes, I crave bigger words in my head and I wonder if I read 'SAT vocab.' novels, would I cognize the context clues, ascertain the definitions and ameliorate my conversations?  I doubt it.            "

Whether we are comfortable with it or not, we are the most powerful country the world has ever seen. Do we use that power to shut ourselves off from the world, turn inward and merrily go along, fiddly dee, tomorrow is another day? I think that we are 50 years past the time when the oceans could protect our country from the world (see 9/11). Like it or not, we have the opportunity to raise the world's standard of living, to bring hope, elightenment and cash flow to billions who would never know the joys of good dental hygene or low infant mortality rates, or education (which are the flip sides of consumerism and Jerry Springer). We must engage the parts of the world that hate us, and let them see the things that make our country and our system great, so that they can understand that it is not just about McDonalds and Nike sweat shops and arrogant conservative Presidents.

409,Gemini,"       So enamoured of his love he was...when she parted for a few days, he went to a nearby river, wrote her name on leaves and floated it down the river hoping to signify who he thought of, whom his heart cried for...and Lo, she was nearby and found said leaves.   After her death...the Raga was written   It is only your picture that caress my eyes now My heart, I gave away to you, yet remains incomplete...my life Why was I destined to live without you?  O Lord lead me to my beloved's abode I plead to you take me to her She was as tender as a blossom She was a celestial beauty Her pristine love for me was your Benevolence Do me one last favour? Don't torment me like this Take me To her! Agony clouds my tearful eyes My life is tearing apart Only memories will remain...only memories     A living symbol of love a centuries-old legend This is the saga of Taj Mahal This is a legend, a symbol... That hearts had met was a miracle of God In each other's hearts they had found their God The two realms rejoiced the earth and the skies  She saw his eyes sparkle, helplessly bedazzled in love Th fairy-like beauty that is her, is to be blamed Such was the shower of love, awesome in all respects It is a living symbol of love It is an age-old story, right from the heart of Taj Mahal  In the path of love when his companion parted To the glorious dying flame he made a promise His love was put to test so be built a wonder --------------  Tears fall from my eyes celebrating what they shared, mourning the loss of love so pure, so quickly and to humbly pay respects to something so true that can so genuinely affect us all - centuries later and to come.   They were real. They were here once. They yearned, they ached, they dreamed, they loved.  Why do I feel the need to thank them? Can they ever know how truly successful their symbol has become? How they mattered to so many hopeful souls out there?  How they mattered to me?  I am at a loss to explain why this so deeply affects me, yet here I sit - weeping at a legend and feeling so close to them I cannot explain it.               "

414,Capricorn,"           I'm feeling particularly philosophical now.. so i shall delve into the topic of true love. What is true love? often asked.. and answered with, '' when u meet someone whom you know you want to spend the rest of you life with, more often than not that thought is reciprocated, knowingly, connections are just made.'' and then you realise that person has a significant other. what do you do then?  maybe we shall start from the when. when do you know that your true love is in front of you? some say the stars shine brighter, if its at night, and some say the sun is muted and the clouds cover it just nicely in the day. i say who the hell cares about the bloody scenery when the one is standing in front of you.  and theres always the what. what do you do after that? after the first glance, the second stare.. then what? again, the common answer, from my experience, is pretend nothing happened.. the reason again being that if it IS true love.. surely there will be another chance.. when you have gathered the strength and courage to do so? no. wrong. you will never get another chance. the next time it will be raining, you cant keep your eyes open.. next time there will be no stars.. you cant see nothing. lame? tell me about it.  next is the who. may you be gay, god bless you damned soul.. yes it IS a sin. anyway.. what if the person you liked never knew you existed? the chance meeting between the eyes just another glance like any other, the reflection of light from the sun playing tricks on what you see. even worse, the person does know you, does know.. what would happen then? awkward, it would be, to ever meet again? yes. and no. sometimes not everything is in black and white. this is often said.. but u will truly realise everything in life IS black and white. gray is just the transition between both, when your senses are confused about what you see. back to the point. who? what if her name began with a soft whisper as you spake it? a dead giveaway, how do you remain civil when emotions begin to grab you left right and centre?  nevermind the nonsense above, but then after that comes.. the how. how do you go about solving the fire burning in your heart that rages on and on and on? extinguish it? a dead husk would be left behind. caress it? it would just burn on. add fuel? byebye. no.. the only way is to bring the only thing that can stand the test of fire into you heart.. love. but how? i never really answered my question in essence.. are you confused? yes you should be.. because i am too.  &nbsp;            "

416,Cancer,"           So today I think my number one lesson or thought was that everyone should just live life as it's given to you, don't care about what's going outside of where you are, just focus on what is going on around you at that exact moment at that exact time. That way it's so much more easier to just lay back and have fun, you don't have to worry about anything else or wonder what this somebody else is thinking about. It's so much less stressful on yourself too. I'm really screwed up though. So I finally get my guy... or have one, whatever, and like I said before I like him! But then there's still that one other guy that I've had a thing with forever, but of course it doesn't work out with him 'cause he's a jackass for the most part and he himself doesn't know what he's thinking.... but why do I still like flirt like mad with the jack and am still hesitent to really start something up with the sweetest guy in the world?! Seriously, if you have an answer to that, tell me. I always think I'm gonna have feelings for the jack guy though, especially when he's all over me, haha. I might also be like this too though 'cause I like guys....and well hell it's summer! Meh, we'll see how it all ends up after vaca.

419,Capricorn,"           happy friday!  there were a lot of pretty good performances last night by pitchers, only one that i would call a great one, so we will lead off w/ that one.  here it goes: yesterdays best: z. day Mtl: 9 IP, W, 0 ER, 6 H, 0 BB, 4 K against the royals.  day has been doing well this year, despite a 5-6 record, he has an ERA of 3.12.  if he gets some more run support, either through offense or a trade, he could win 15+ a season.  he is a very good young pitcher. c. zambrano ChC: 8 IP, W, 2 ER, 5 H, 4 BB, 7 K.  he is a top 5 pitcher so far this season IMO (schmidt, r johnson, a. benitez, clemens). 7-2 with a 2.27 ERA.  his curveball has a lot more on it this year than what i have seen before.  he is able to depend on that pitch as well, and i think that he has potential to maintain this all season. c. fossum Ari: 6 IP, W, 0 ER, 5 H, 2 BB, 5 K over Bal.  his counterpart, bautista for Baltimore had a perfect game thru 5 or 6 i think, but gave up a 3 run shot the next inning. this was definitely an aberration (he got his ERA below 6), so i wouldnt look for another similar performance any time soon. c. pavano Fla: 8.2 IP, W, 1 ER, 4 H, 1 BB, 7 K.  another pitcher quietly having a good season.  while beckett and burnett are struggling, pavano has been the marlins' rock in the rotation.  2nd straight very good start (6/4 7.2 IP, W, 1 ER), and 6-2, 3.10 on season.  he might be peaking right now, so i dont know if i would hold on to him for the rest of the season. k. ishii LA: 8 IP, W, 1 ER, 6 H, 1 BB, 4 K. also having a good season (8-3, 3.36).  he is getting a bit more run support than last year, not by much, but more nonetheless.  he has shown improvement each of the last 3 yrs, especially w/ his control. c. schilling Bos: 7 IP, W, 2 ER, 6 H, 2 BB, 8 K.  always good for a solid performance, schilling has had a consistent season. for his price, you could probably get a marginally better pitcher, but he is not going to let you down very often.  if you have the money, he is a smart pickup.  those were the best performances of last night.  some pitchers to look for good things from tonight are: livan hernandez Mtl: plays at seattle tonight, who has been a struggling offensive team.  hernandez is known as an inning-eater, so i will predict 7.2 IP, 2 ER, 5 H, and a win (why not go for it all w/ my predictions?) tim hudson Oak: a safe enough pick, playing at home v. Pit, whose offense had been struggling, although they scored 7 yesterday.  i will say 7 IP, 3 ER, 7 H, and a win for tim.  i think the A's can match however many runs the pirates throw up there. al leiter NYM: has an ERA this season below 2 (1.78 i think).  playing against KC only enhances my confidence in him.  i kind of want to say CG shutout, but leiter probably doesnt have that much endurance in him.  7 IP, 1 ER, 2 H, win. brett myers Phi: plays at Min, home of the 'evil ventilation system'.  he will overcome this hardship and get a win in 6.1 innings.  he will give up 3 ER and 6 H. i know this to be a fact (not really...had you fooled there) scott schoeneweis Chisox: my 'out on a limb' pick for the night, he had a great rookie year 3ish yrs ago (along w/ rick ankiel), and has done well this season as well. performance of the night v. Atl-CG 3-hitter, 1 unearned run, 2 BB, 9 K, win.  there you have it, who says i dont have the balls to predict stuff?  hope this is helpful and accurate.  if you find any errors, you will get mentioned in my next post, and maybe you will win a new car!  any comments regarding format and or content are always welcome.  good luck, and have a good one!

423,Capricorn,"             Today I got up at about 6:00 or so.  I did go back to bed until 8:30 AM.  I had a dream but I forgot about it.  Probably wasn't important anyawy.  Today I was to meet Erika at the Oaks Movie theater at 11:15.  So I left at about 10:50 and I arrived early, actually.  So she picked me up.  And we chatted about biology and forensics and electron microscopes and whatnot.  That was fun.  She's in interesting person.    I arrived at Matt's house early.  Before everyone else, nearly.  I just kinda stood there while his mother and Erika arranged stuff.  I offered to help but there wasn't anything really for me to help.  I did help bring up some beverages.  I felt like a sore thumb.  Like I didn't really belong.  Which was partly true.  I mean, I don't think I would have been invited if I had not had plans with Matt that needed to be broken.  Sigh.  His friends started arriving.  They were cool people.  There were a couple of silences which I didn't understand.  They must be really good friends, I don't know how there were silences.  There's almost never something like that with my friends.  There's always constant conversations with my friends.  But I guess people are different.  I think the day was fun.  Although it was getting bit old and overdone with meeting new people, these were good people to meet.  I had a great time.  I was kinda sad I didn't get any time alone with Matt but I think it was important for him to spend time with his friends and family.  Since he is going away.  Maybe I'll have time with him later.  I hope so.  I don't want this to be the last time we meet.  I really like him.  I want him to stay here so I can be with him more.  I hate this.  He is such an awesome guy.  I don't want to let go.  Heh, look at me, I have watery eyes.  Sigh.         "

430,Aquarius,"             It seems everything is not all that smooth in Seoul concerning the recent changes.

433,Pisces,"       ................ ...shhhh.... ................  my office is completely quiet right now. (which never happens.)   i realize that i haven't had many minutes of completely quiet during this entire break.   two days in pajamas after new years with the fam -- were very sabbath-y, but not quiet.  Jaelyn got new braids today -- her stylist is named Whisper.  It was a tragic, tender-headed experience in the downtown mall, J.C.Penney salon.  The only moments of joy were when I invented a story in which Addison and I had ridden a runaway escalator up, up, up through the roof of the mall, past the clouds only to be rescued at the last possible minute by a recurring character in my stories -- Mortimer the seagull.  Mort also perches on the dock in front of the family cottage in while we eat dinner in the summertime, looking out over Mackinac Bay.   Outside I think that the (newly) freezing temperature has frozen the entire world in a grey cloudy, leave-less, snow-less funk.    On a whim on Saturday morning I made pomengranate sauce (remember my dream from over a month ago).  It turned out beautifully.  I'm a happy man.   My grandma Marge sent me a draft of her story -- Through the Register -- I'm living in the pools of my grandparents stories thinking about what they mean to me / about me.  Jodi breezed through town last night and we loved looking @ pictures of her trip to Egypt.   Watched SPIDER this weekend.  VERY provocative film.  I liked it a lot, but don't count that as a recommendation until we have a conversation about it...  ~peace.    "
434,Libra,"                 I took the LSAT monday.  The culmanation of a 2 week blitz study session.  I don't want to go out on a limb and predict my score, but I think that I'll be at least comfortable with it.  The testing environment was much better then Oct. '02 when I last took it.  This time I think I'm ready to make the plunge, hopefully I can get in to the schools I want though.  But I have 3 weeks to obsess about how I did, and you know me.  I've already established a Y! group to try to compile everyone's memory of the exam so we can see if we got questions correct.  So far I've gotten most of them right, but I'm not sure about this one about 'Health Education' and Propaganda.  Anywho, that's all I got to say about that.  On another note I've been talking with this really kick guy on IM (but he know's about this site, so I won't go into detail about this...  if you want the skinny you can contact me ;) ).  Also I've been really blah at work, an I'm going to Connecticut this weekend.  I'm really hoping to slow down for a bit next week.             "

436,Gemini,"            I too suspect this might be a conspiracy or a sort of showing who's THE BOSS attitude from the FM. After the show of the markets and coming as it is the first budget of Manmohan Singh as PM, this proposal to tax the transactions will have an adverse impact on the Stock brokers. The margins for these short term transactions are wafer thin and the .15% tax on it would wipe out even that. Though there are some who dismiss this theory, there is no solid proof of this theory being completely wrong. The mere fact that there are leaders in the ruling coalition who wished markets to hell would not make this thoery redundant.         "

So what do you do?   This Queen turns temptation back on itself.  I'll lick that morsel off a finger - but my tongue will linger and lave, while my eyes speak volumes in narration to the act.   I am worthy of being Queen my minions, I have controlled temptation in my hand. It isn't temptation in it's highest form - when that comes - it will have one hell of a task ahead of it. I do not worry for that day to come - I won't be 'defeated' by temptation.  Perfect moments in time happen to those who are patient for it.   Though, I must say - Good Gracious Me, this Queen's senses are heightened to new levels and easily aroused to the forefront! ------------------------------------   Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety.

441,Pisces,"       . Politicoblogging .  Oh come on, it’s election year.  You knew I couldn’t avoid the subject forever.  As some of you know, I am a pretty staunch liberal in my political views.  Having emerged from a right wing family / school / lifeworld / upbringing, I think I understand the motivations and underpinnings of conservative political thought.   However, I have to say that in today’s political climate – particularly given the pervasiveness of issues of globalization – the categories of political liberal and conservative are often insufficient.    So I’ll get into that issue on another day.   I want to start politcoblogging with an argument that I think everybody might agree upon.  And when I say everybody, I really mean BishopRudd (eg. The Pirate / Coach / etc) – who is by far the most regularly-opposed, but brilliantly-analytical reader that I have.  Here it is:   People are voting too often for issues as they affect them directly and individually INSTEAD of voting for the good of the country (and mutatis mutandi, the larger world).  If voters were more focused upon the general good of everyone when they voted, then democracy would be working optimally (both thriving on participation and encouraging participation).  People are far too concerned (on the right and the left) about which candidate will protect their interests.  I’m arguing that this self interest can only devolve into worse and worse politics.    Effects of this attitude:  political rhetoric becomes increasingly partisan, single-issue-focused, and non-wholistic; voter attrition; special interest lobby groups become increasingly powerful in swinging elections.   I believe that this problem proceeds from the left and the right equally, and I’d just like to do my part during this election to push every person that I know to think about voting NOT as being about protecting your own interests, but instead as an opportunity to think about –   The greatest needs for our country.    And then ask: What is the best way to address those needs?  Of course this also allows me to explain what I see as the greatest needs for the USA and how those perceived needs influence my vote.  But that’s a later blog.  peace~    "
442,Aquarius,"       I know it still shouldn’t feel like this, like I’ve missed something irreplaceable, something that will never make it back to me, something that I can’t even describe, something intangible but just as devastating. I feel like I’ve lost it somewhere from here to the cornfield, and if not the cornfield, some other just as dull place to lose something valuable and precious. And I only remember that I’ve lost it when I talk to her. Her voice, her life makes me look around and see what I don’t have, what I lack in this life, what I’m missing, hers and only hers. Most days I go home and I see my battered 70’s wallpaper and I think how authentically retro it is, but today it just feels like peeling flecks of the past cluttering up my conscious. Most days I see a relationship that is in a hell of a lot better repair than any one person that I know, but today I feel like it’s a restraint, a corset cinching up my entire potential energy in its archaic clasps. And it’s just her voice that does it. I keep thinking of all these plans that I’m making, all of these great grand adventures that I am going to have, but that’s the indisputable drawback in my life, I’m eternally waiting for something, there are so many things I am always going to do, but I’m never fucking doing them.  And that’s why it’s her voice…. Because she is doing them. She without a second whimsical thought of consequences moved to New Mexico because she needed adventure, she tasted the entire open world on her tongue and this Midwest boredom was eating her from the core of her insides. And she went with her kinship soul mate, her eternal girl friend, someone closer than a relationship, a sister. And now that other girl, that girl that is not me, is graduating from college, something that I am always going to do too, and the Desert Princess and this other girl are moving to Southern California, because they can. Because they have some secret knowledge of how you make things happen, of how you just load your car with your belongings and you head to a strange city without worrying about money or a roof or food, because in their world things always work out. There isn’t hunger or homelessness, none of these social injustices can ever infiltrate their world of bikini bodies and tanning sunshine. So it’s petty, it’s selfish, it’s a primitive form of jealousy, I just wish it could be me running off to California with her, packing up my tiny apartment because California’s waves were whispering my name. I wish it could be me just picking up my life and moving, but I don’t know how.   Mike and I have been going to New Orleans for six years now, he’s had that map of Louisiana tucked in his infinite boxes of the past for six years now, but somehow in six years we’ve never once managed to make it there. We’re still here, we’re still stuck in Belleville with the boarded up windows and the homeless people that can still afford their cell phone bills. And the white ghetto boys with their gold plated chains and supped up Chevy Cavaliers that their moms and dads bought out of the paper. We’re still here with the single mothers smacking their kids in the head for hitting their siblings, and all my lonely friends and their bad relationships. I’m still here listening to all those girls bawl their eyes out because yes, he cheated fucking again. And I’m still sympathetic, I’m still pretending that I don’t aspire to be anything more than they do, a Midwestern housewife that revels in Ricki Lake, a woman that can sleep till noon while their bad children wet their diapers and watch Blues Clues, but what the fuck do I care because I’m hung over because I was out too late last night trying to escape the boxed fate that I have cemented my entire life into.   I can’t stand it here now because hearing her voice reminds me that there is so much more out there, a million things that I am missing sitting here in this dimensionless cube, this particle board prison. Her voice tells me that there is a conceivable way out and I am obviously too stupid and too blind to fucking see it. I don’t have kids, I don’t have ties here, I don’t have responsibilities that prevent my escape, but year after year after fucking year I find myself staring at the same barren stretch of highway, the same billboard signs with JESUS drawn huge across them right next to the sign for St. Louis’s newest Casino. I’m still looking at Mike looking at me wondering when the fuck are we ever going to get out of here, and if we don’t, well then….. we are our parents, the trap has gotten us. We are dead here, walking in a daze until death comes courting us, stuck in our jobs staring at big blaring signs above our desks that read in bold red letters “You are here FOREVER!”  I wish it was me with her, but I would be giving up too much, sacrificing a better friend than she could ever be to me. So it’s not really even her…. It’s more that she got out. That’s what I want.      "
443,Pisces,"       just before midnight on halloween night, i was walking across the parking lot in Marietta Ohio bringing two styrofoam cups of orange juice to Bemis & Scott Bell, noticing how the half moon had grown large and looked like an overripe precarious bit of orange fruit, about to fall off an overtaxed and invisible branch down toward the blue steel bridge which would definitely shatter into a hundred shards into the Ohio River.  Just then a very small, completely black kitten ran across the parking lot and the cement sidewalk.  There was no turning back.  If I were to go to my hotel room at all, ever that night, I would have to stay on the path which had now been crossed by a small black cat.    But what is the significance of a black Kitten crossing your path?  Certainly not seven years of bad luck? The very kittenness of the cat must either reverse the effects making it seven years of good luck or make the badluck stick for life.    Asian beetles are flying into my office window, but I'm not going to close it.  The day is just too beautiful and the mobile Greg Snell & Bev Matiko made for me is whirling in this delightful slow arc over my green metal 1960-something Steelcase desk.  It makes grading these persuasion papers a great deal more tolerable.    Have I ever mentioned on this blog that I hate grading?    That and drop ceilings.  ~Peace.    "

In fact,  urlLink onPO!NT Media Group  has a new site as of today. Check it out! I worked on my scrapbooking today and am happy to report that I used up a bunch more of my paper and I am one layout away from being done with the year 2000! Next I just have to do Christmas 2003 and all of our pictures from this year. I'm going to have to save up my pennies to get the pictures printed though! I always think it's cool when the guys are interested in my scrapbooks. I'm not sure why it means so much, maybe because it's not something you typically expect from them. The other day on the phone Jason was asking about my albums and if I was going to bring them up this summer. When Kurt was here the first thing he did was flip through my albums and 'catch up.' I've been busy since we moved!  Tonight Ked and I watched the Tampa/Calgary Stanley Cup Game. I think it's only the 3rd or 4th game we've watched on t.v. Last fall we watched a few of the Yankees/Marlins World Series games. The Bolts didn't do too well tonight, but we did see a few good fights!               "

447,Capricorn,"                 If you've ever seen the classic movie Casablanca you'll know what I'm raving about. If you haven't then I strongly advise that you do, and if you have seen it and didn't like it I regard you as less than human. I'm writing this at 11:00 PM, after just watching it for the first time. I was slightly wary at the beginning because I knew two things, one its an old movie, so the characters are always well developed and you learn to love them and, two, its a World War II movie so somebody's going to die. But, it was recommended in World Magazine's 50 Best Movies, so I knew it was a must-see, whether I liked it or not. The funny thing is that even with its not-so-typical-Hollywood ending, (which I ususally don't like) it has captured my imagination, and has me completely under its spell. I can't say more, or I'll say too much.      "
448,Capricorn,"                 This evening we had a piano recital. I didn't do particularly well, but then again I absolutely hate the piece I played, and it is not the sort of piece that does credit to anyone's ability whether it is played well or not. If you've never been to or played at a typical piano rectial you might want to consider it. It's not that it's an informing of enlighting experience, but it's just so down-to-earth homely. They always start out with the little kids who sit on the piano bench and their feet don't touch the floor. They loudly plunk out some melody or other, usually things like 'Lullaby' or 'Detective Song'. Then there will be some brilliant youngster who makes you feel ashamed of yourself because he plays so well at his age. Then there's a string of twelve-year-olds with varying performances. After that comes the teenagers who barely nod to the applauding audience and slump off the stage without bowing. (There are some exceptions to that rule--my friend, Jenna and myself, for example.) Finally it ends with the old student who plays a very impressive piece from memory. This is the general pattern for typial recitals.       "
449,Taurus,"       Yesterday was a good Saturday, sort of. I went to KL, got money and treated scoot and his friend at KLCC. just three guys hanging out checking out stuff and chicks. We had some beer(god i feel awful about that) at shrooms, checked out the live music and got drunk.Thats when everything gets fuzzy.It seems i called Rini, i blew all my credit on&nbsp; her.I cant remember what i said.I called her just now and she confirmed it but she said i didnt say anything bad or embarassing.I hope she's not lying.This is gonna come back and haunt me. I know it.  I do remember us going to Uncle Dons later that night in Hartamas. There was this woman Scoot met on Frenster and she was nice and stuff. Scoot was like telling us, this girl used to be a model but the girl we saw well..lets just say she's not my cup of tea. We talked and joked and she was quite the conversationalist. Good company. But i got this vibe from her.She's like 28 and not married.complaining about the lack of good men around blah blah blah.She seemed desperate.I could almost hear her tell me her falopian tube is&nbsp;singing its farewell song before it dries up. tick tock tick tock.The guys told me later today that she really hit it off with me,and most eye contact was with me.They're gonna sell her my phonenumber...i'm apallled but somehow amused. I spent the night at Scoots place, damn his place is as clean as ever.Its so fucking homy.comfortable.With the 5ft tall Cure poster, those collectible action figures, damn i wish my place was like that.Mike the cat had grown considerably since i last saw him. He has a new fren, another stray Scoot adopted. Awww..I was lying down reading a book (High Fidelity, that made me laugh a lot) and he slept on my tummy. Went to sleep around 6 am. got up at 2pm, watched Tv and had coffee, went out to eat and Ali drove me to the lrt station. and here i am in Shah Alam again..yay..but it was a good weekend.Scoot was still the same, always reminding me my life is different from him, and not be him.He's like saying its too late for him and he's only 31.Stuck in a dead end job with no money etc. He's a happy chap but somehow i sensed regret and sadness in his tone when he says stuff about his life.But he's a good friend. Whats with weekends and clubs and bars? you see all these young middle-class professionals making so much noise. a futile gesture of defiance.Its when their lives are starting to disappoint them.'look at me!' 'i know how to have fun!' Tragic, good thing i learned how to stay home and sulk. I learned some lessons today, i &nbsp;was unhappy. i was in self-denial. first it was numbness, then silly optimism and then unhappiness. the phase i am in now.If not why would i need alcohol to have fun? Why did i drink? WHY. i swore i'd never drink again. I comprimised myself. I'm sorry Zul. i wont do it again. I need ballast. Too much ballast and i'll sink. no ballast and i'll float away.Amy was my ballast, now she's gone and i'm floating.I dont think its clever using relationships or women as ballast.

Really, when I say words just aren't good enough I mean it. His music is so powerful, it's hard to believe it's human. I love classical music, but lately I've just fallen in love with Chopin. My piano teacher says she fell in love with him when she was my age too, so I guess it's not that unusual, (for people who like classical). This morning was a dreary, rainy day, and Chopin has a Prelude, called 'Raindrop' that just captures the feeling of a rainly day so perfectly. No wonder this music has survived so long.        "

458,Sagittarius,"        Wanted: Katie Sleeman   Life is complicated, and sometimes I feel like I'm only here to be confused as some higher power finds it funny to place me in situations where everything I believe in and should uphold is tested in a series of ordeals.  Lately, things have been like that. I've been questioning alot, most of all questioning the soul reason I exist along with who I am and what I stand for. I'm not sure who I am particually who I think I portray. Everything I see a movie, or act I become a related character...in some situations good, most of the time bad. (It was not attractive to see me in tights trying to portray Robin Hood)  But the main question to me is who is Katie Sleeman? I'm looking for a resume to submit of me. Who I was yesterday laying in bed trying to sleep is not the same person who sits here. I think I am the perfect example of change considering I am a constant mutation. A constant mass changing never disapearing considering mass can't be destroyed but I float from decision to decision changing experiencing learning trying and being confused.  My friends are a god sent and their constant support always seems to make me happy. I always seem to get in this mood when someone writes messages in YPM or YP documents. Thank Ya'all who signed.  Can I still like or lust? I'm not what my emotions are like anymore. I guess that I can only just exist and try.  Lonelyness is not a factor anymore cause God can't possibilty find it so funny to leave me without a better half. My mind is like a strainer...it's quickly draining.  Well...if you would like to...you know. Wait no you don't know.  It seems that every couple of months I re-evulate everything I stand for but...this 'month' the flavor is as follows: -folk music -the giem (the gym) -afternoon naps -learning how to debate -smiling (rare) -swimming nude -my friends -being what I think I am -being loved    "
459,Gemini,"           Horror has a new name, and that name is Everybody Loves Raymond. By itself, it's not completely horrible. It's certainly much more watchable than a lot of other family-centred sitcoms on the air (primarily I'm thinking about the abysmal Reba, but there's certainly a lot of other examples). What irks me is how channel 10 have adopted Raymond as the jewel in its comedy crown. For a while, it was being aired no less than seven times a week with a mix of both new and old episodes in various timeslots.   Two words. One hyphen: Over-kill.  The show can actually be entertaining, there's the occasional inspired, funny moment. It just simply isn't that good. In no way does it have the watchability of a show like Seinfeld, or Frasier. Both shows tend to be repeated pretty frequently lately, and I'm still yet to get sick of either despite how often I've seen the episodes.  Everybody Loves Raymond does have two strengths. The first is Peter Boyle. Honestly, Boyle isn't great in this, but generally, Boyle always delivers the comedy and dramatic  chops in anything he appears in. Just take a look at his Emmy-Award winning performance in The X-Files episode Clyde Bruckmans Final Repose, or his gig as the monster in Young Frankenstein. The dude is gold.      The second strength of the show is Brad Garrett, who has more or less become the focus of the show as Raymonds brother Robert.    The guy plays his lethargic, wounded butterfly character like no other ever could. The guy simply screams for you to pay attention to him with just his standard frowning glance. Currently, however, Garrett is fighting with the producers of the show over a pay dispute. He hasn't turned up to work for two weeks running as a ploy to get paid at a similar scale to his fellow cast-members. This morning I found this article online:   As the squabbles over salary continue between Brad Garrett and CBS, Garrett has decided not to report to the set of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND for another week. Yesterday, RAYMOND producer Phil Rosenthal decided to give Garrett the finger by giving co-stars Patricia Heaton, Peter Boyle and Doris Roberts a cut of the producing pie for the show. Each actor will get half a percentage point ownership in the show, which means they will profit about $5 to 7 million dollars. Producers have already cut Garrett out of the season premiere already and will likely do so for the second episode.  Source: Hollywood Reporter    That's just madness. The show is in what they declare to be the final season. Just pay the guy some cash and put up with him on set for a couple of months. He's really the only reason the show has been occasionally watchable. He might be an arsehole, but he's certainly bringing a lot more of the funny than the succubus Patricia Heaton. The woman needs a cross and a stake ASAP.  I say, pay the dude, they'll have a better show for it in the long run.         "

Will there be any one to Protest the decision then?. I hope the bench will reconsider its decision sometime.

469,Aquarius,"                  Look out here we come!   It's not often that I read something so funny that I laugh til I cry. Today was one of those rare moments. I received my new issue of Today's Christian Woman and one article titled 'Been there survived that' had me in stitches. Unfortunately, TCW still has last month's magazine posted on their site, but if I ever see that article show up I'll link to it. This author gave her top 10 mothering tips. She has 2 busy boys now aged 10 and 8 and her stories were so hilarious I was crying. I think what made it so funny was all I could think of was Ked and his brothers Kurt and Ken. Her stories sounded an like the stunts those three would pull (or sometimes what Ked pulled on the twins!) and as I read this lady's story I kept thinking of those 3 at that age. It's a good thing my mother-in-law has a good sense of humor. I'm sure that helped keep her sane.  Another funny story is our mattress was delivered today. Well, I suppose it's not funny that they delivered it, but the rest of the story is funny. After they left I'm eyeing the mattress. We went from a normal mattress to a pillow top. For those of you who haven't seen the awesome bed frame Ked and his Dad built, our bed sits pretty high. We have 6 huge drawers under each side of the bed and we designed it so the bed sat about hip level. Well this new mattress is at LEAST twice as thick as the old one, so it now sits a couple inches higher than my waist. I now have to take a few steps back and get a running start to jump into bed!! I'm just kidding...kind of...I do have to do a little hop to get on top! I called Ked this afternoon and said 'Ummmm, honey, I think we're going to have to get a stepping stool so I can get into bed!!' It's really funny, but it looks great. In fact, I need to finish this up so I can go to bed. I can't wait to sleep on it!  Tonight Ked and I had our TV graphics class at the Public Access station. I mentioned that probably a month ago how we were working to get certified to produce tv shows. It was a lot of fun tonight because the class was just the two of us since two others didn't show. It was easy and we now have our graphics certification. Our next class is next week and it's on editing. We're still tossing around ideas for a program, but we think we're narrowing it down.  In other not so cool news, I think I have the hives! I haven't had hives since I was in the first grade (I was allergic to my teacher!). I don't know why I have them, but I'm trying to get to the bottom of it. Every day for about the past couple weeks, I wake up with itchy spots of little bumps and a rash like surrounding it. Today upon examining them I'm pretty sure it's hives; it's definitely not bug bites. It's usually been just a small spot and is mostly gone by afternoon, but today I woke up and had a lot more than usual of them on both arms and my neck, and although they went down this afternoon they're still there and slightly itchy tonight. Ked and I've been racking our brain and neither of us can think what might be causing them. I haven't changed any of my laundry products, or my diet, and I'm not stressed. They show up every morning, so today I washed everything on our bed - the mattress pad and sheets and pillows. It's weird. Any ideas??  Anyway, I'm taking my itchy self to bed!! buh-bye!               "

471,Gemini,"           I've always wondered how I'd spend my time should I ever develop invisible powers or become a ghost. I suspect I'd spend a lot of time loitering in womens showers or perhaps catching a free movie at the cinemas. Really, what else would there be to do? Nothing fun at least. The worst thing possible would be to be forced into getting a job. Which is exactly what happens in the television series Dead Like Me, a wickedly funny new telly series thats just started airing in the US on the cable station Showtime.   So, what's The Deal?  George (A female....because it's cool to give girls boys names in TV shows) believes that its best not to become too interested in things, because it will save from being disappointed. She's directionless in life with trouble connecting to her family and former friends. Not that this is necessarily a problem for her considering that on her lunchbreak during her first day at work, she finds herself being killed by a a piece of debris falling from a downed russian satelite (a zero gravity toilet no less). So, after discovering the afterlife, she is made a grim reaper.    Who's In It?  The show is headed up by 22 year old Mensa member  urlLink Ellen Muth . She doesn't really have any credits to her name....unlike supporting cast member  urlLink Mandy Pantinkin  (known best to audiences for his role as Geoffery Geiger in the great first season of Chicago Hope). The show also did the impossible for me. It actually made me like  urlLink Rebecca Gayheart . A woman who previously has given me sharp stabbing pains in the temples everytime she gets on screen. Here she's actually quite funny. The showrunner and creator is  urlLink Bryan Fuller .   So, what happens in the crucial first episode?  A ton of great funny moments and a heck of a lot of script development. George dies. She finds out she's a ghost, and in turn a grim reaper. Then there's fun and hi-jinks as she learns how to be a Reaper, while also making some contact with her family. There's a beautiful moment where she rearranges some magnet letters on the family fridge to contact her mother from the afterlife.....it's certainly not a sacchrine moment.   But is it any good?  It's certainly the most promising new show I've seen in a few years. It works as a bit of a mixture of  urlLink Ghost World  meets  urlLink Six Feet Under , but brings its own vibe to the mix. It's a hoot.            "
472,Aquarius,"              urlLink    Here it is, the superfantastic phonebox!  Today is a great day.  Our lovely officegirl Jung Mi (please no letters, that's what secretaries are called here) went to LG Twins building and got me a new phone.  I really needed one on account of (i) my old one was all in Korean...which was fine because I memorized where to go to do things on it...and (ii) the screen kept going blank because I produce copious amounts of sweat when I inline skate and was dumb enough to be on the phone at the same time.  Well, after 4 screens at 60,000 won a pop I decided it's time to get a new one...but I may end up breaking this one too.  It's soooooo cooooool.  It has a little camera which I used to take a picture of the box (of course it took me a while to figure out that I couldn't use it to take a pic of the actual phone).  I also took a pic of our lovely officegirl...and then inputted her name and number as well...then ordered up caller ID (something I didn't have before, much to my chagrin).  Then I asked her to call me to test it out.  Her mug showed up on the little screen on the outside of the phone (how cool is that?!?!) and she immediately started panicking and saying, 'Change! Change!'  haha, Some Korean girls really hate to have pictures taken of them.  She did, however, insist that I put the pic on this posting...go figure.  This phone really rocks.  I can take pictures, email them or send to other phones, and send and receive normal emails too. Also, it has a language converter so everything is finally in English.  It's tiny, too...like the size of a fat businesscard.   urlLink    Here she is doing the Korean sign for 'take my picture'.   urlLink    Here is a coworker of mine with the same pose.  Why? Why?         "

Its an addiction I have, I need caffeine and NextBlog every morning to get me going.  I don't know how that button works, or how it selects which blog to go to next, but today there was a sort of theme woven into the melange of goodies.

Even  people I only talk to on the internet every couple of weeks or so will ask me questions like 'You probably hate alcohol don't you' and when I ask them why they would say something like that they say, 'You just don't seem like the kind of person to do stuff like that.'

I have some friends, who I would otherwise consider very intelligent, that claim there are two types of people:  A) [Ignorant] Republican Bush-lovers (well, for them the bracketed part is implied)  B) People who liked  Fahrenheit 9/11   Now I really must fuck up their little categorization scheme, since I do not fall into either category.   &lt;FOR THE RECORD&gt; I cannot stand Bush, and if there is anything that pisses me off more than the stuff Bush does, it is the fact that Kerry is the best candidate that the democrats could find to run against the guy. &lt;/FOR THE RECORD&gt;  But Michael Moore's 'documentary' seems aimed at hammering in the point without admitting any of the counterpoint. Now anyone who has spent time in a court of law (or at least watched some  Law & Order  over the last decade) knows that anytime you do not admit your opposition's points   in order to dismiss them   that you have weaknened your case because now the opposition has something to talk sbout. In this case, there are all the gaping problems in the movie that Senor Moore chose to not talk about. Now, everyone in my friends' Category 'A' will have something to use an excuse to defocus the very real questions that he brought up in his 'documentary' film.  Now these friends of mine claim that if this had been done, the movie would not be as useful. But I refuse to believe that Michael Moore would not be able to be just as incendiary had he taken the time to make an actual  documentary  rather than a propoganda piece like he did. Since his supposed goal was to truly have some influence in the election, he could have spent a little more time and treated the American public a bit more intelligently, and had a greater effect.  In my opinion the biggest problem we have today is that there simply  is  no one who would be good for the job (at least not anyone who is in the running).  Ok, end political rant.    "

487,Leo,"             I got an early phone call from a good friend and we talked about relationships and stuff, and how things could changed in just seconds, which made me wonder about life..my life. Sometimes, life can be so perfect, when everything seems to be just right and you feel like you can't ask for more because you already have what you want. We are blinded by happiness without thinking about what's gonna happen next. When we fail or when something bad happens, we start blaming ourselves for no reasons. We feel like we're stucked in one position and we can't move on. Or maybe it's us who don't want to move on? That's probably because we're not ready. And I don't think we'll ever be ready for everything.    Sometimes you just have to accept for what you get in life, either it's good or bad. We should just enjoy the good and learn from the bad. Should people be afraid to hope or to reach for something? I don't know, I feel like I don't really want to give too much hope anymore. We live in this world to gamble and from what I've been through, I think there's no need to be afraid. But before we make efforts, we should probably be prepared about what the result's gonna be like. Again, it's easier said than done. But, hey..it's worth a try.             "
488,Aries,"           Good luck on your interview.  I only hope that all these strategies, while relevant to rational opponents, transfer smoothly when applied to irrational opponents.  I'm not entirely convinced that the policymakers in control right now fully understand how different it is when your opponent perceives him- or herself as the servant of God.  Kind of ironic, when one considers how much a certain party insists on using language that suggests that they, and the country, are...the servant of God.  I feel both sides, for or against, are presenting only partially convincing arguments.  Both sound good to a point, but then they drop off into the la-la land of kneejerk idealistic political party lockstepping -- I follow along for a while, nodding in agreement, until it suddenly seems to me as if out of nowhere the proponent whips out his or her ideological dick and starts waving it around.  I must say, though, that I'm glad we're sending *billions* to Turkey so they'll let us put a base there.  I'd hate to think we could have wasted some of that money on collapsing school buildings, kids without health insurance, or parents unable to tend to their mentally ill children.  For now, I'll continue to reluctantly support the 'war,' such as it is; I'll reserve more comprehensive judgment until more time has passed.         "
489,Virgo,"                 hmm...wow, haven't blogged for a while. Went to dinner right after chem last night so didn't go on the internet. chem as usual was amusing. michael caristo is much better at teaching but as kiz pointed out, scary because he picks people to answer questions. the most amusing thing at chem this week was the prediction that zbaras would say 'ill go if you pay for me' in the context of the  yr 10 formal . kiz asked him and he said exactly that...tsk tsk, zebs you cheaparse. *sigh* besides that, chem was a bore for we did not mention the word  wig . >. today has been extremely boring. woke up at 10 --- the  latest  in a long time. spent whole day doing my jap powerpoint when i figured out my completed copy was left at school yesterday --- i  forget  to take out my floppy disk!

493,Sagittarius,"        The Glamorous Life?   I live in Downtown Miami, in the lap of luxury... on the 25th floor with a balcony overlooking Miami and the Beaches.  I have a f-a-a-a-a-bulous view of Biscayne Bay and the Ocean -- way over there on the horizon.  Miami is beautiful and draws all the beautiful people.  Movies are made, videos are shot and we are all dripping with glamour.  There are advantages to being a Downtown Diva.  With that in mind, let me tell you about last Friday night.  A production company has been filming 'Fast and Furious 2' for months now, in and around Miami.  They've been filming in my 'hood for the past few weeks.  Yes, glamorous.  Glitzy and fabulous.  Haven't actually seen that yummy Diesel guy, but he's hangin' in my 'hood for filming.    And, last Friday they were filming until the wee hours of the morning - actually they didn't even start until 11pm.  How do I know this, you ask?  I know this because that's when I was going to sleep - or at least I thought I was.  At about 11:30, while falling deep into peaceful slumber, I was violently and rudely awakened by screaming police sirens and screeching tires.  Now, I'm used to sirens in the middle of the night - after all, it is Downtown - but not at this high volume.   After my heart began to beat again, I got up and went out onto my terrace to see what all the commotion was.  It was Fast and Furious 2.  They had closed of the entire 4 blocks of the street one block over for this scene, which apparently involves a high speed police chase outside a strip club.    Also, apparently, they didn't get it right the first time and had to re-shoot the scene around 2am - sirens and tires and all.   So, when you go see this movie (sometime next year probably) and you get to the scene outside a really colorful strip club with a green entrance, know that you're in my 'hood.  And when you hear the screaming sirens and the screeching tires, remember your Diva being ripped from her slumber at 2am when they shot that damn thing!  Ah, the glamourous life.   Diva out.

497,Aries,           and how is this different than what you normally do around your house? (just kidding)         
498,Pisces,"        Archive Imported from my Orignal Blog -- The Invisible Next Step    Longing Together    I suppose I've already taken the (invisible and inevitable) next step....I invited several of you to actually read this blog. I've actually been journaling and reveling in the anonymity for awhile on this blog and others, but reading Jared's blog last week convinced me that the whole I idea of *linked* texts created a much more substantial, important way of being in the cyberworld.   Or, more likely, a convergence of multiple co-incidences convinced me anew of the value of “community” even online…   Last Wednesday -- Josh, Toph, Emily, Sam, Katie, Jeremy, Trena, Andrew G., Ryan K., Seth, Kelly (back from LA!), Sarah, Brian Hollingsworth, a group of people who I love a great deal all came over to watch and discuss Waking Life with me. It's my second time through the film -- but fun to watch it with a bunch of filmmaking people...The sentiments of community seemed pooled all across the shag carpet of the basement family room to me...   And that groupness is co-incident with, of course, the whole line of narrative within that film regarding the collective consciousness of everyone -- a vocabulary which I couldn’t help but indigenize -- to talk about the longings we all share and the common brokenness that attenuates living and becoming in contemporary times…   Coincident with --reading one of Sam's emails -- each one of which always encompasses at least one narrative universe -- and I told her that she should start blogging and sent her to read the Prayer of Jael postwhich I got a tremendous kick out of...   I’ve been lurking for a while on several blogs and only when Sam asked me 'what this whole blogging thing was about?' (and Marcia asked the same day...) that I really started to muse about the communal and co-performative nature of this new communal writing....   I wrote to Sam:   …in a sense all the interconnects of people who read each others journals seem to actually create a kind of shared consciousness…people separated by space and time   i also sometimes think of their interconnected narrativity as a kind of performance. public performance. almost like a way too wordy play where there's nothing but exposition and the conflict isn't betwen two of the characters and no one's really trying to be explicit about what the conflict is..   Coincident with our weekend trip to the Gibbs Family Abode in the Detroit Suburbs. As we meandered closer and closer to their house, Lynn and I realized that neither the directions I ascertained from Greg, nor the ones Andrea gave her included a house number. Each ended with us arriving at “a brown ranch house.”   I have always loved about the Gibbs the way they throw themselves with joy into the life that they are living. They *live* in a brown ranch house like no one I know could. The colors Andrea has painted the walls! The photographs that Greg-I’m-“into”-photography has taken of the kids! The firepit on the back patio! The joi de vivre of their brood! The improbability that they will ever use words in French or Latin backhandedly even though they could!   The weekend simmered in happiness…swapping stories, disappointments, ambitions…   And then (at least for me) boiled over on Saturday night when, as Greg cooked a phenomenal tenderloin, the stories and the meanings really kicked in.   They shared about the community that has adopted them – how powerful and strong the force has been in their life. We talked about the language of redemption that this community has given them (Follow Christ! Even when the Church Fails!) – and I shared how the language of redemption for me right now is probably the opposite experience (What?! I can find Christ here?! In the Church!)   Andrea said – so well – “And what’s so cool is that God is calling both of you. Calling you through this one language of redemption and calling Greg and us through this other language.”   And we all talked about how that language meant so much because it was so rich in the *presence* of People. How much the love and mentorship and grace and gifts of these men for them – of Marcia (and Harry and the Waalkes’ and Dawn and the Leons) for us deepened and made resonant the possibility of life in community.   But for them and for me it has been the presence of so much SHIT in the world that has made this community so important. Andrea talked about the feeling of WEIGHTS around her legs for even the most mundane tasks. Lynn mourned the difficulty of finding respect and love in her disparate roles and apart from her staunchly silent and pragmatic family. Greg talked about the difficulty of separating ego and identity from church and church work. I mentioned feeling lonely, unsure about vocation, fractured in my fathering and partnering.   It is the brokenness that is our own and the brokenness that we inherit that makes the possibility of CALLING within COMMUNITY so invaluable….   Coincident with: visiting Ryan and Angela. When I walk through their house I feel like I am drifting through the best possible version of what I like. Ang plays a cello in the living room, white shear curtains billow from the paned windows in the guest room while I page through the collective memories of friends and family who have also slept here, Ryan's pictures and nostalgic technology pop in the most surprising enjoyable places, Angela's albums are as carefully crafted as my grandmother Linda's, Ryan and Ang and I conspire together over guitar, CDs and Cello how we will -- very soon -- become rock stars (!).   And then coincident with all of that -- I happened to scroll through my address book today and hear a hundred rushing whispered reminders of the voices that have poured themselves into my own voice. I was impressed with the great fortune of the people I know and have known.   So now I’m officially blogging about VOCATIO.   And my assumptions (If you’ve slogged through the bramble of all these posts) thus far are:   It’s hard for me to hear God’s voice.   God’s voice shows up from things that we hated, regretted and didn’t expect to matter initially.   God’s calling comes to us through community.   What’s next?       "
499,Aquarius,"        urlLink    D&nbsp; urlLink     From a summarization of English law in 1632 titled 'The Lawes Resolutions of Women's Rights.'     'In this consolidation which we call wedlock is a locking together. It is true that man and wife are one person, but understand in what manner. When a small brooke or little river incorporateth with Rhodanus, Humber or the Thames, the poor rivulet looseth her name.... A woman as soon as she is married is called covert.. that is, 'veiled'; as it were, clouded from and overshadowed; she hath lost her streame. I may more truly, farre away, say to a married woman, Her new self is her superior; her companion, her master...'     I am not a poor rivulet!!!! We're, or I should say I, are having an issue with me dissolving my name and taking his in replacement. He feels I have to bear his shame, I think he's just too steeped far in tradition to understand why he would even want to continue such an archaic and useless tradition. Is it ridiculous to have an attachment to my last name? It comes from a long distance, out of the picture father, so it's not that I want to continue some abstract family heritage that I'm proud of. It's a simple last name, two syllables, nothing complicated, nice and Irish. But mostly, it's just who I am. It's like by taking his last name that I am forgoing completely this person I've worked 24 years to become and now I am going to give her up. Just because some long dead men in white powdery wigs think that my entire estate and being should be dissolved and incorporated to serve my husband. Should I deliver to him a goat and two acres at the alter too? Should I track down my dad and demand that he pay up with my dowry? Well, now's not a good time at all to say that I haven't remained chaste until marriage, looks like I've blown the whole thing.   I'm marrying him, isn't that good enough. His family name is meaningless to me, except that it defines who he is, it labels him so that I can pick him out of the yellow pages more easily. So why do I have to give my existence and adopt his. We would still be legally bound, I would still be pledging eternal monogamy till death do us part, and that is the fucking sacrifice right there, so why the name too? I feel like by giving into this I am saying that who I've been all this time is insignificant. My being is not worthy of maintaining its own label, I have to assume someone else's .   When Katie got married she was worried about dropping her last name too, her last name was spoken with reverence, people identified her not as Katie but a combination of both names. They flowed together, and they truly were an emblem of who she was, wild and reckless Katie with confidence and wit to spare. But she decided that she was ready to shed that person, leave her skin snagged on desert rocks and adopt this new Puppet sounding last name. She was ready to be a new person. Changing her last name became a fresh start to her, a symbol of new beginnings.  Well, I don't need a fresh start or a new beginning. I don't need to shed any part of me, I like who I am. I don't want to be someone else. And sure you can argue that changing my last name doesn't remove any actual part of myself, I will still be the same person. But that is bullshit. If it doesn't change any part of me then why do it? And the best answer anyone can come up with is 'Because you're supposed to'? Says fucking who? If they're male, no offense, you have special interests in this subject. I don't care what liberation you claim to believe in, marriage is a sense of property for you. And if you're a woman, You should fucking know better.   I get so mad at him over this. He says we're not getting married if I don't cave. But I am about the most stubborn person on the planet and giving into this is an acquiescence I can't justify. If I give I'm saying it's okay, that because it is a traditional practice that has not been challenged for centuries then it is acceptable, it is okay. I swear to god, I will find a fucking goat to give him if he wants tradition this bad.      "

502,Taurus,"           This weekend I didnt spend much time outside and from the few places I went, the predominant theme seemed to be, my pet pondering, Death.   I started at Place de la Concorde.Its a majestic square.Only one side of it has a building and all the other sides are open.There were two fountains in the middle with 8 statues each symbolising the french cities.The star attaraction of the square is the 3200 year old (!!!) Luxor Obelisk.With the Eiffel tower not far behind, it adds to the scenic seduction, I should say.  Very near is Jardin des Tuileries.A beautiful garden.Its better than the one in Luxembourg quarter.Here I was accosted by a boy who had a similar build like mine but far younger than me. 'Excuse me,Sir.Do you know English?'.  I thought he's going to ask me the way to somewhere for which I had a prepared answer, 'Sorry.I am a foreigner!'. But he asked me to read a card,which read,'I am staying with my mother and brother here.We are from...(I forgot!).My father died in Bosnia.We are starving.Please give me some money'. These were not the exact words,but the meaning is intact. I read and looked at his face. 'Sorry!' and smiled.I still do not know why I smiled then! These kind of acquaintances, although very short, kindles my mind very much and makes me ask seemingly silly questions for which I have no answers and I had to decide that I went by instinct rather than reason, which is very sub-standard for a rational being. After enjoying the garden, I proceeded to Palais Royal and the surrounding garden. Nothing very attractive.  To go to the palace, I had to go through Rue de Rivoli. At the middle of it is the statue of Joan of Arc. It reminded me of the movie with Milla Jovovich as the protaganist. I liked her figure and the way she portrayed the character. Fantastic. Rue de Rivoli is magnificent and imperial. You suddenly forget that you are in a very modern city and feel like being in a period where an emperor rules the country. This is not the only place where I get that feeling, since Paris is painstakingly maintaining her countenance. They don’t allow buildings to soar so that all the monuments and other historically precious places are prominent in the skyline. That’s why when I look Paris from the top of any tower or a monument, I get a feel of being in 18th century with all its kingly glory. The road has a lot of shops and I went into a few of them, just to see what’s in there and how the shopkeeper looks like!  The second part of my day was spent in the Latin quarter. I think they are the prettiest streets of Paris in the evening with lots of boutiques and restaurants. It was very busy.  Then I landed in the place of the day, the Pantheon. The facade looks like the pantheon of greece. I pitied the poverty of the imagination of its architect. But its supposed to be an architectural feat. All I could reason for that feat is its difficult to place 2 huge domes on top of one another with lot of room in between and support them with only 4 pillars which form the end-points of the 4 aisles, with the plan of the building looking like a cross with a circle at the intersection of the cross. They call this kind of mix of Greek and Gothic architecture as neo-classical style! It means that its neither new nor classic. Its a confusion. But the facade with this greek Pantheon-like pillars and the peristyle of the lower dome , looked royal.  The space inside is vast.The place is the necropolis of the great french personlities. The names I could recognize where Saint Genevieve(the patron saint of Paris, who (she) is said to have saved Paris once from an attack of some barbarians),Victor Hugo, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Marie & Pierre Curie .I couldn’t go to the main place called the Crypt, which hosts the tombs below the chancel, for I had arrived there lately. In the middle of the space, at the intersection of the four transepts, is suspended the Foucault pendulum, right from the centre of the dome. I have to study what its all about! The walls had a lot of big backed pictures and pendentives. The spiral staircases took me, with lot of other tourists, to the peristyle, to have a panoramic view of Paris.I asked to take a picture of mine with the Eiffel tower far behind, in the colonnade, to the lady who guided us to the top. I gave her clear instructions on how the picture should come and where I and the tower should feature. She invariably messed it up! Somehow cameras or the photographers screw up my photos. All the passport photos which I had ever taken, except for the one in my Nortel ID here, have suffered this. Every photographer and camera seem to conspire against my face! So I ditched her and gave the camera to a tall guy and gave the same instructions. To my surprise, he took it almost as I wanted. I was happy. 'Where are you from?', he asked. 'India. Bangalore'. 'I am from Mexico'. Then I heard the guide cry something in french. I thought he is explaining something and ignored it and was immersed in a bit of day-dreaming. After a couple of minutes, when I realized where I was, there were nobody around. When I looked down, all the other tourists had went down. I could see them on the terrace down there. There was a door open. Then I came around the place to see if anybody else is there. When I reached that door again to go down. It was locked. For a moment I feared being left there. I started yelling 'hello' towards the stairs hoping that somebody would hear me. No reply for a couple of minutes. I pushed the button which was besides the door thinking that its some kind of an alarm. No reply for that too. Then I turned back. All the tourists were still standing there staring at me yelling. One of them shouted that the guide is on her way. I felt relieved.  Then I roamed around the latin quarter streets for sometime. Her I came across a treasure trove! Shakespeare & Co! At last I have found a book shop which sells good English books! It was very old. I forgot that the guide book had mentioned about this. There was an odd-tempered very old man owning the shop. The shop too looks pretty old. Theres a reference library in the first floor of the shop. Earlier I had seen one more bookshop in that quarter. But the books were all of those not so meaningful subjects like engineering and technology and science. But this one dealt only with those soulful, and hence comparatively although not completely meaningful subjects like philosophy, literature and art! I bought Les Miserables. When I came out of the shop it started drizzling and I returned to my room.  The next day I roamed around Montparnasse. Hell lot of theatres. Every street atleast has a couple of cinema theatres. And some sex boutiques too. Should look lively in the night. I saw Tour Montparnasse, which was, when it was built, one of Europe's tallest towers. This, I guess is the only skyscraper in the heart of Paris. All others are in the outskirts like La Defense. I didn’t go up the tower for it would have set me back by 8 euros!  The next place in my plan was to visit Cimetiere du Montparnasse (The cemetery of ...), one of Paris's biggest cemeteries. It hosts the tombs of many french prominent personalities across all the fields. I went to see the one of the famous existentialist couple, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, the couple I most envy. They dominated the 19th century philosophic and literary scene of France. I took a couple of small stones from their tomb as memento mori! Some names I would recognize there were Guy de Maupassant and Henri Poincare. I wondered at the man's thirst to be remembered even after death when I saw some strangely designed tombs. I wanted to see the whole of the cemetery but I had to go to Catacombs by 2PM and so I rushed through it.  For the first time, the map in my guide showed a wrong pointer to a place. Because of that I have to disturb some localites there to arrive at the  place of Catacombs. This is a very special place! Napolean, once wanted to clear all the cemeteries in Paris and clean up the city. So he dug up all those and stored all the remains of dead bodies under some 3 'mont's of Paris. One of those is Montparnasse and the place where he put all of the remains is called Catacombs.  I had to go down a seemingly unending spiral staircase to go to the underground storage place. Once my head started rolling and I had to stop for a moment to regain myself! At the entrance there's a warning asking weak-hearted and weak-bodied people not to take the journey!  Then I had to walk some 2 kms underground to arrive at the storage place. The walkway was very narrow and fearful, if alone. Thousands and thousands of skulls and bones. Wow! what a sight to see! Good that I didn’t miss this. For the next 2 kilometres of the maze-like dark alleys which were dimly lit, wherever you turn you see the skulls staring at you. I was petrified at the collection! In some places the underground water was seeping through the roof, making the walk even more difficult. For the next hour or so all I saw were those skulls, the emblem of Death. This is one of those places where I want to go again for I forgot to take a picture of myself with full of skulls and bones in the background. It would have been a marvelous photo.  Then again to come up to the city, I had to enervatingly climb those stairs. I was a lot relieved to see sunlight and brightness! And I was a kilometre or further from where I entered and I had to search my way back.  I was satisfied with the treat of these places and ended my weekend stroll!

508,Capricorn,"             I just got an e-mail from Matt today.  He is at home but his sleeping schedule has been erradic and he has yet to see me online due to the time (or lack of) he has spent online.  Visiting people and doing this and that before he leaves.  And I totally understand that.  I had expected this, although I wished it never came true.  I'm having mixed feelings.  I feel  angry  at him for not sending me an e-mail when he got back.  I feel  angry  at him for not calling me when he was over there.  Or anything at all.  There was no contact and I am  afraid  that it will be like this when he really does go over to Japan for good.  Yet, I feel  happy  that I did recieve an e-mail from him.  But at the same time, it feels like I'm being squeezed into a time slot.  An appointment for him.  I want to act  selfish  and request special attention but that would just be bratty.  He said that maybe he could squeeze me in for a movie or something.  But not for the whole day.  I guess I'll settle.  Thats all I can do.  A movie?  Which movie?  We can never agree on any kind of movie.  I had wanted to spend the whole day with him so I can spend some time with him on my bed.  Because we always wanted to do that.  It'll be romantic and fun.  But I guess not.  If we were to do anything, it'll be in the car again.  I want to do something.  But then again, I don't.  It is the last time we are going to see each other again in our teenage years.  What is appropiate?   I don't think I want Charlotte to come with us.  But I want her to meet Matt.  I think that once she does, she'll know more about me.  Since no one really knows that much about me, I want her to be one of the first to get to know the real me.  And to meet Matt.  But then again, its our last meeting.  Is it wise to invite another person?  I don't think so.  But I'm torn nonetheless.  Whatever.          "

513,Cancer,"                  Five months ago I met someone online. And between him and me is a special friendship. He's the kind of person you can talk to about anything. As in anything. That's how I felt when I got to know him. We've had endless convos from no-nonsense things to the things that really matter. I've talked to him about my past, my present, and what I want to have and be in the near future. He knows me quite well enough to know when I'm down and something's bothering me. He knows so much about the up's and down's of my recent 'failed' relationship.   Well, even from the start, he was always there to listen to me whenever I needed someone to talk to. He's always there to encourage me and make me see the bright side of things. Even when my most recent 'failed' relationship was about to crumble, this special person (yeah, he's special alright...very special!) was there for me all the time, unlike my ex.   Isn't that ironic? I mean the person who's not within arms reach is the one who turned out to be there for me all the time. Unlike the person I should be expecting to be there for me was the one who's somewhat 'unavailable.'   I know I shouldn't compare the two of them but how can I not make a comparison when I can see the big difference between them? At some point, I asked myself what he really means to me. I know there'll be a lot of raised eyebrows and cynic comments when the idea of falling in love with someone thru the net or online relationships or long-distance affairs becomes a topic at hand. I for one, think it was silly but things are changing for me. I find myself falling for someone online and not just that. It's someone who's out of the country. Someone you can't just be with whenever you feel like it. *sighs* The strange thing is, I feel as if I wouldn't mind the distance. I wouldn't mind the separation. As long as the person makes me feel he's always there for me makes me somewhat contented.   I gave 'us' a chance. I mean, my relationship w/ my ex. I was constantly disappointed in him but because part of me still loved him, I was hoping at the back of my mind that things will change. I hoped things will run smoothly for us. But it never happened. He failed me and I failed too. I failed to make it work for the two of us.   Eventually, I realized that someone else was making me happy. This person has done a great deal for me. The little things he do. The way he cares, the way he's concerned about me just makes me melt. I'm only human and I can't resist such things.   Now I find myself in love with this person. No hesitations, no second thoughts. I know I feel so deeply for him. I thought that if I finally made a choice to either be happy or stay in a relationship wherein not all things are reciprocated, everything will be okay. But as it turns out, this person has some unresolved issues of his own. Issues that he's still hung up on. That I feel like if I could just take away all the hurt from his past, I'd gladly do so in a heartbeat. But the thing is, he just won't allow me to do that yet. He just doesn't know how much I care for him, how much I wanted to to take care of him, how much I love him.   He never fails to make me feel that he's always there for me or make me feel special. It's an unspoken understanding between us. Like a relationship with no labelling or whatsoever. Sometimes, it makes me anxious to get to the bottom of this. But I know it's not easy coz there are certain things in life that's hard to let go of. And in his case, there's something he can't just easily let go. And that hurts.   I'm still working on coming to terms with that. It's hard especially when you get to spend hours talking to him. For me, those are special moments that I really value. Even if it's just 15 minutes of my break, each conversation is important to me regardless if we really had something to talk about or we're just goofing around. It's one of the things I look forward to each day. To talk to him in every possible way. To let him know that I'm always here for him and that I care. More than what he thinks.   Guess I'm going crazy don't yah think? He! He! He! And because of this, I'm losing focus in everything but not in a bad way. Can't do anything but think of this person, talk about this person, blah blah blah.   It's like a line from one of my fave songs,  'I'm falling even more in love with you, letting go of all I've held onto. I'm standing here until you make me move, I'm hanging by a moment here with you...'    Yeah, it's like I'm in limbo. Steady, unmoving but somewhat reeling from the moment. Just waiting for things to fall into place. Waiting and waiting and waiting. Will it ever fall into the right place?   I told myself I needed a break probably from everything and everyone and decided to stay away for some time. I didn't go online for 2 days just to tone down my addiction to chat or addiction to one person so to speak. It's like substance abuse. Like when you start taking a bite of chocolate, you just can't stop eating it till the last bite. And it was one hell of a challenge but I guess I'm weak when he's concerned. I ended up missing him more. I even tried not to look at my celfone but dang, my fingers were itching to make a call and text. Ha! Ha!   In short, I failed. I only made it for 2 days and fell off the wagon so to speak. So, here I am again and I just wonder.....wonder.....and wonder.....  "
514,Aries,"           When Justice Is Mocked By BOB HERBERT   he jovial voice on the other end of the phone was that of Robert Keahey, the district attorney for the First Judicial Circuit of Alabama, which includes the tiny town of Butler in Choctaw County.  Mr. Keahey is the prosecutor who brought capital murder charges against three retarded individuals for the murder of an infant, despite the fact that he could not show that the infant had ever existed, much less been killed.  If there was anything about the case that bothered him, he didn't let on. He laughed frequently during the conversation, and it was difficult to resist the impression that he found the whole thing amusing.  All three defendants were black and indigent. It turned out that the woman who supposedly gave birth to the baby in 1999, Victoria Banks, had been sterilized in 1995. But Mr. Keahey would not drop the charges. With capital murder indictments looming over them, and the hostility of the local community apparent, all three defendants pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter.  I asked Mr. Keahey how it was first determined that Ms. Banks  who claimed she was pregnant in order to get released temporarily from jail in an unrelated case  was really pregnant.  'She came in weighing about 120 and she left weighing about 160,' he said. 'And the sheriff saw her grow from a thin woman to a fat woman with her belly poking straight out and her belly button turned inside out.'  'Was there a pregnancy test done?' I asked.  'No.' said Mr. Keahey, adding 'There was no need for a blood test or anything like that. You could look at her and tell.'  This was interesting, because a doctor who observed Ms. Banks at the time said he did not think she was pregnant. The doctor wanted to do a pelvic examination, but Ms. Banks would not allow it. When a second doctor reported hearing a fetal heart tone, Ms. Banks was released on bond.  That was in May 1999. When Ms. Banks was taken back into custody the following August, she did not have a baby and there was no evidence that she had given birth.  At that point, Mr. Keahey's prosecutorial power went into overdrive. Sol Wachtler, a former New York chief judge, once famously said that grand juries would indict a ham sandwich if a prosecutor wanted them to. Mr. Keahey managed to prove that not only can you indict the sandwich, you can convict it, and send it off to prison, too.  After intense and prolonged questioning without the benefit of counsel, Victoria Banks, her estranged husband, Medell, and her sister, Dianne Tucker, were all arrested and charged with murdering a baby that  based on the available evidence  was nothing more than a fantasy.   Mr. Keahey said all three defendants confessed to the crime, and that was enough.  I asked if there was any evidence, apart from the defendants' statements, that there ever was a baby.  'We have no physical evidence,' he said.  After the three defendants pleaded guilty and were incarcerated for manslaughter, lawyers for Medell Banks raised enough money from churches and other charitable sources for an examination of Ms. Banks by a noted fertility expert, Dr. Michael Steinkampf of the University of Alabama School of Medicine. Dr. Steinkampf determined that the bilateral tubal ligation performed in 1995 had been effective, and that in his opinion Ms. Banks could not have become pregnant in 1999.  Based largely on that evidence, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals recently declared that 'a manifest injustice' had occurred in this case and threw out Mr. Banks's guilty plea. But he continues to serve his 15-year prison sentence while awaiting further court action.  The jovial tone in Mr. Keahey's voice changed at the mention of Dr. Steinkampf. 'He thinks he's God!' said the D.A. 'Yeah, that's right. He don't believe any of the good, honest, law-abiding Christian people in Choctaw County when they say the woman was pregnant.'  I pressed Mr. Keahey throughout the interview for any evidence he could offer that the child had ever existed. 'They hid it from the rest of the world,' he said.  When I asked about the possibility of hospital birth records, he burst out laughing. 'She didn't go to a hospital,' he said. He laughed harder. 'If she had gone to a hospital, that would have made it easy.'               "

522,Leo,"       Last night I was sitting on the can and had the thought that it might be a good idea to write about something that happened to me years ago, just over ten years ago in fact. It's about the first time I fell in love, or at least thought I did. I'll leave out many of the boring details because I'm told that they, rather than adding depth and interest, just make my stories long and drawn out. I was a youngster staying at a hotel/casino with a parent. This meant than while my parent was gambeling and doing whatever I didn't have shit to do. However I was a horny youngster so I went to hand out by the pool, I didn't have a swimsuit, but I figured that girls probably did. Well, while sitting by the pool I noticed a girl around my age, who actually turned out to be a couple years younger, sitting with her grandparents. She was very attractive in an offbeat sort of way; I couldn't really put my finger on it or figure out why I thought she was so attractive but you don't really questions those things too much do you, if you think someone is hot you don't really care why. Well, being a little wuss I knew that I wouldn't talk to her, especially no in front of her grandparents, so I didn't really think about it. Now, it becomes important to point out that I am, and always have been, a big ice eater. In my earlier years it wasn't uncommon for me to just get a cup full of ice and munch on that for a while, something that I did at exactly this point in my story. I got up and got a cup full of ice and sat back down. About five minutes after that the girl got up and got some ice as well, on her return trip to her seat she commented to me about how great the ice there was. This shocked the hell out of me because at that point, and to a certain degree to this day, I had the feeling that I was pretty much invisible and went unnoticed unless I walked into someone or something.   At that moment nothing more came of that. Her grandparents and her eventually got up and left, I had nothing to do so stayed there for a while. There was a view of the river nearby from the pool area, so I checked that out for a while. I eventually got bored and decided to walk around elsewhere. I left the pool area and hit the elevator button, which was right on the other side of the door from the pool area, when I heard someone say hi to me from behind. It was that girl, we talked for a little bit (untill the elevator got there). It turned out she was waiting for her grandparents. When the elevator arrived I really wished I could keep talking to her but I didn't know if I would look crazy if I called up an elevator and didn't get into it so I left. I kicked myself all the way to whereever I went after that.  I did something, ate dinner, blaa blaa for the next few hours untill it was almost time for bed. I told my parent that I wanted to go for a walk, which was true. I was told to be back by 10pm. I went back to the pool, mostly because I wanted to see the girl, but also because I enjoy being outside at night and looking at the stars, even to this day I can sit outside and look at the stars for hours and not get bored. When I got there I found that I was the only one there, I sat down and thought about things for a while, then a door opened and she came out. We talked for a couple hours about all sorts of stuff. I found out that she was from Seattle and her grandparents lived in Sacramento. I can't remember her name (I'm terrible with names) and for some reason it completely slipped my mind to try to get her address.  When midnight rolled around we both figured that we were probably in quite a bit of trouble for staying out so late and went back to our rooms. I was happy that I had met such a cool person but sad because I knew I would never see her again. I was actually depressed about this for a few days. I wrote in a journal at this time in my life and I'll repete here the advice I wrote in my journal.   If you take the time to get to know the perfect person, at least make sure to get her address.         "

534,Pisces,"                  Sunday, March 7, 2004       Pisces Daily Horoscope by Astrocenter.com    Recent events in the department of love and romance may have you feeling as if you are simply not getting your needs met, dear Pisces. Remember that other people aren't mind readers the way you are. If someone's behavior isn't sitting right with you, tell them so. Romantic partnerships shouldn't be something that you make personal sacrifices for in order to maintain. They should be something that uplifts and supports your dreams.    Even though I have a tendency to read my horoscope daily (however, never at any set time of the day), I find them to be questionable. From my experience: if you read your horoscope at the beginning of the day, one goes through the entire day relating events that could possibly occur to the predictions outlined in the horoscope. If you read your horoscope at the end of the day, (regardless of how shitty it was), you find a way to relate everything that has happened to the predictions of the horoscope.  Irregardless, I guess I find some sort of strange comfort in regularly reading my horoscope. I can't describe it. I don't necessarily believe everything that is written/predicted. Perhaps, in some way it fictionalizes ( is that a word?? ) my life, making it seem semi interesting.  So, I went out last night and had a  horrible  time because when I got there I started to feel ill. Too make matters worse, at the end of the night (read: 4 in the morning), the line up to get my coat at coat check was outrageously long. A police officer yelled at me to leave; so I yelled back that I was going a f^%&'n place without my jacket. Dude at the coatcheck lost my jacket stub and I didn't end up getting my jacket till about 5:30 am (yup, that's right an hour and a half  after  I had given him my stub).   I don't mind getting home at 6 in the morning if the night was enjoyable. But when it's a shitty night, and you've spent the majority of the night wishing you were already at home...getting home at 6 in the morning just means that you'll be grumpy the next day.   ...rotating....   urlLink John Legend   ...anticipating....

535,Virgo,"           Hell...  I have never felt comfortable enough with anyone to really tell the first sexual experience I've ever had, so I have a bit of a problem with first times. Some people may even say that I don't give a good first impression, but as they get to know me, in time, they change their minds about me. I find that hard to believe, I think they actually confirm that I am a pompous ass and just realize that I am rather harmless and decide they can actually get by without giving a damn about me.  So without further ado I give you what hopefully will be endless pointless observations on my life and pretty much a complete waste of time.          "

537,Leo,"           And now for some random garbage off the top of my head:  I say random an awful lot. Not as much as this one guy I know, Randy R. Randomner. He was off in Pakistan a few years back and got arrested for spray painting 'elect a duck fart' on the wall of the US embassy, and then the Swiss army came in and tried to extract him which is odd since A: He isn't Swiss, B: he doesn't even know anybody in Switzerland, and C: Switzerland doesn't actually have an army. So he was all in this jail trying to figure out how this army that didn't exist and had no reason to be there anyway was trying to get him out of a jail in pakistan, when he realized his cellmate was the one and only Mr. T. Mr. T was there because 'foo' apparently means something to the effect of 'overthrow the government' in whatever the hell language they speak over there. So Mr. T was going on and on with his 'I pity this foo' and 'I pity that foo', and Randy suddenly vanished into this air, only to rematerialize on the campus of M.I.T., with no clothes on, and a bowling pin stuck halfway up his ass. Well, needless to say, he was instantly known as the coolest guy on campus, and even though he never got around to putting any clothes on or taking out the bowling pin, he still managed to to become an olympic foosball player using the math skills he learned in college. and he would have made it to the Olympics, except that he kept saying how it was the most random thing he had ever seen how he had come to be on the olympic foosball squad, after being in a prison in pakistan with Mr. T only a few years prior, and his coach eventually got tired of it, and kicked him off the team. He did end up going to the olympics, though, as the flagbearer for the Swiss team.         "
538,Cancer,"       Good evening, fellow mortals. I am incensed due to the current health warning in my little part of the world. In accordance to the weather channel, the ozone layer is currently disintegrating like styrofoam. They state:  A CODE ORANGE HEALTH ADVISIRY IS IN EFFECT.   This translates as, 'the ultraviolet rays that are seeping through the atmosphere are so damn intense that they can fry you like batter if you step outside for a long time.' Fun time if you like skin cancer. I personally don't find the idea appealing. I am genetically inclined to that kind of stuff (cancer, etc.).  Can you say diesel fuel byproducts and artificial refrigerants? That spells CO, CO-2 and CFC.  I am not happy with the environmental situation. They really need to roll out the new hydrogen cars.  Cheers, humans.    "
539,Gemini,"       ---------------------------------------------------------------  It's twelve o'clock, and it's a wonderful day. I know you hate me, but I'll ask anyway. Won't you come with me, to a place in a little town. The only way to get there's to go straight down. There's no bathroom, and there is no sink. The water out of the tap is very, hard to drink, Very hard to drink.  You, wait 'til tomorrow      Silverchair - Tomorrow  ---------------------------------------------------------------  This Queen hasn't figured out why that song always pops into my head when I think about my trip tomorrow morning. I like the metaphor and significance behind it. There is also another song that comes charging to the forefront but I will post that on my journal site.   Am I nervous about this trip? Terribly. My Bad Ass was quite right - I have no control here, the loss of it is making me nuts.  What is a Queen without her control? Lost. I didn't book the ticket, I felt kind of bad to NOT go because I know they can ill afford to give me such a generous gift but they too have pride and wanted to do this for me. I don't know the area, I don't know the town, I didn't get much chance to do research or check into it. I just don't have anything tangible to hold onto. Thank goodness my ticket got here yesterday because that's something solid I can hold in my hand and take to the airport with me. I have achieved that much more control but still...I am very nervous about this. Nervous isn't even the word, because I know my friend well and I think we'll be more than fine, I think Apprehensive is slightly more appropriate. Not so much of her, but of other elements of my trip.   My birthday curse is not easily lifted and I know she is doing this so that I do have a great birthday for once. Ironic that this year I would have really loved to gone out and partied heavily with a few particular people who I will not be seeing either way so no use in that. I'll be happy if nothing goes wrong or no one is upset. You know I'm going to psyche myself into having a terrible birthday at the rate I'm going. It really shouldn't be a big deal, really it shouldn't. But when it happens so very often, with such scarring memories...you tend to focus a bit on that particular week. What's worse - my yearly 'bad week' is coming up in June. That's where it's just a bad bad week, extreme bad things happen during those dates and bad memories are associated with them.   Ok enough on bad days. This Queen grows weary of it all. Onto interesting things...I will attempt recording my travels for you all to revel in my exciting life. Snicker if you will, but you are reading it for a purpose.   Adieu my Minions, I will tolerate no disobediences or attempts to overthrow. Remember, my presence may not be physical but I am with you always in all ways.               "

542,Libra,"                 Shit...    Back at work after a kicking New Year in Manhattan.  I had so much fun.  We went out like every night hang bummed all day.  But not much of it is funny beside the New Years party itself.    Well first off, do you know that there's this channel in NYC that plays  ads for porn?  It's great, but they wouldn't let me watch it.  Girls can be such prudes.  Oh and Friday night I run into an old friend from College at a bar in Union Square, I hadn't seen her in like 2 years.  NY is a lovely yet strange place.    Anywho, So we went out to the  China Club  at arount 8:30 or so.  It opened at 10, and there was no line so we went to a bar across the street for a round.  (meanwhile I had half a dozen beers at Netsie's place)  Get back in line about a half hour before the doors open, and it's FREEZING.  There was a girl in front of us smoking and I thought she looked cold, so I offered to give her one of my gloves.  So we all started talking and her other friends showed up.  One was from Birmingham, and I'm like (in my head) 'Alabama?'  But then he started talking and he was obviously from England.  So he asked us where we were from and I'm like 'Originally, Connecticut.'  Well it turns out he's staying with people from Fairfield, right near my home Trumbull.  So Glove Girl was like 'Do you know Ellen Tollman?'  and I'm like 'Yeah, I touched her breast in 6th grade.' I was off the hook.    So we get in and have a lot of fun drinking and dancing.  All of a sudden I notice that there's nobody on the Stage, so I jump on and start dancing, draging a friend with me.  So a little while after that I'm up on a block on the stage and I lose my balance.  I face-plant on stage.  Bam Bitch went down.  I was craking up so hard    Then a friend of mine wanted to go, so I made sure she knew how to get home and let her go.  Okay not my most chivalrous act, but it was like 12:30 and I wanted to partay!  About an hour or so later another one bites the dust and boots on the floor (and a little on my new shoes I might add).  So Netsie packed her up and headed for the coast.  So we were down to 3.    3 am rolls around and I can't find any of the remainder of our crew.  Finally we hook up and take off.  By this time Times Square (which we had to majorly bypass to get to the club) was now kinda empty making it a straight shot across 47th.  We make a quick stop at McDonalds.  I order a double cheeseburger meal.  When it shows up I get all pissed and am like 'There's only one!  I have two patties and one bun!  What the hell am I supposed to do?'  Well it turns out I really wanted the two cheeseburger meal, so I could share, but I was too gone to think straight.  (I have the same problem with Twin and Double beds, I can never remember which is which)    So the next day I get up at 9:20 and have to walk 12 blocks to meet my sister at my brother's place.  But with some new bruises a strained shoulder and a kicking new limp.                 "
543,Aries,           Snow flurries happening.         
544,Scorpio,"               My Mobile Phone...literally   I walked towards the tram yesterday, as the wind blew and the last hints of twilight shone in the sky. It was about 6.40pm, and I'd just spent a good 45 mins or so just chatting with Jessie after lecture, while she waited for Tammy to finish class. I had a nice time, just having coffee and talking about school - Jessie's so easy to talk to.   Anyway, since it was pretty close to dinner time, I figured I'd better give EG a call n let him know I was on my way back. I reached into my jacket pocket...and found it empty!  'Arrrgh! Where could it be?' I checked my bag, rummaged through it. As the pit of my stomach started to swirl, my brain kicked in. 'I probably left it in the lecture hall or something. Better go find the security guard who locked it.' So i ran to the station, hoping to somehow locate the guard. He was there! Manning the station! Angelo was his name, a guy in his late 20s-30s, and he was kind (and friendly) enough to call another guard to walk with me back to the theatre, which was right at the other end of campus.   So me and Keith, this tall man with a moustache, probably in his 40s, walked in the cold back towards the theatre. 'Where else do you think it could be?'  'I don't know. The Baillieu Library probably...'  'Have you checked it?'  'No, not yet. Probably later.'  We walked up the steps to the theatre. I walked in, and searched the area where I sat. No phone. He looked up and down the theatre steps too. No phone either.  'Sigh, it's ok, I'll check with the library. Thanks!' 'Yep.'  I walked back towards the library, where I'd gone with Jessie to zap lecture notes. I put on my jacket there, so I figured it must have slipped out then. I checked with the librarians and the lost-and-found counter there. No deal. I tried calling EG on the payphone, and Jon's house phone, but no one picked it up.  My heart dropped as I registered the fact I'd probably have to spend a few hundred bucks to get a new phone. Money that I found hard to part with. All this while, I was begging the Lord 'please, Lord, please...', yet was resigned to the fact it was probably gone. People adhere to the finders-keepers mentality over here - I lost my sunnies a month back, and never saw it again. Let alone a phone!  I walked in dark back to the cafe where I had coffee with Jessie. It was probably closed though - it was already 7 plus. The ground was damp, the air cold. I shivered as my toes gripped my Birkie sandals. A light! People were still there! I knocked on the glass door. 'We're closed!' said the girl on the inside. I knocked again. She gestured with her hands, that they were closed. 'Hey John, there's someone at the door knocking!' she said in a nasal voice. John looked up. 'I'm sorry, we're closed'  DUH, I knew that already.  'I'm sorry, but did you guys see a mobile phone in here?' I yelled through the glass door. 'What?' 'I said I think I left my phone in here!'  He opened the side door, and I explained myself. 'Sorry, we just cleaned up, and didn't see anything.' 'Oh, it's ok' 'I'll leave a note in the the cafe, in case I find anything, so you can check back tomorrow?' 'Thanks.'  I trudged on, towards the Student Union info desk, in the vain hope that someone might have picked it up. It was closed.   I scrounged through my bag again, then decided to return to the library to call someone. The only other number I had memorised was Charles', so I called him. 'Charles!' I squawked, 'I lost my phone!'  'Huh? How?' 'Don't know lah. Must have dropped it somewhere. Do you have Chris' number? I'm trying to call pple at home but no one's picking up!' 'Ok, hold on ah...'  He gave me the number, and I lamented how I'd have to buy a new phone. He offered to sell me his other phone, the one he had but wasn't using at the moment. I said see how, still praying that I might find it.  I tried calling my phone, in case the person who found it picked up. Or at least if it was switched off, at least I knew for sure it was gone and could move on. It rang. And rang...and rang. It was on vibrator mode though, so maybe whoever had it didn't hear it.  I retraced my steps again. No phone. I gave up.     tune in tomorrow to read the next episode of... My Mobile Phone...literally              "
545,Gemini,       The Queen is exhausted...worn out mentally and emotionally.   She needs this break now that she's venturing to visit her little sister in Indiana. I expect lil sis needs it too with recent tragedies at hand. Good news - lil sis is getting herself married and I think she's happy about it all. Bit worried though that she's not handling things appropriately in terms of her feelings on the current tragedy. Dunno what else to do beside grabbing her and shaking her a bit - which may come in after a day or two that I'm there.   Yes I'm looking forward to seeing others as well who will be there for my own reasons. I have no idea what I'm wearing for this wedding but I'm sure I will find something.

Blogger's all confusing with how you put up pics and whatnot--you have to download this messaging-like publisher called Hello to do it for you (which I think sort of sucks).  Anyhow.  Remember that site I mentioned that lets you make a Buddy Icon of yourself?

But I wanted to try one out anyhow; we're suposed to have our icons replace our staff pics on the Hyphen bio page online.

547,Capricorn,"           this is my second blog. i started doing a blog of fantasy baseball update type stuff (i will make a link soon in case you care), so this is a more personal blog.  feel free to comment or share your thoughts (a form of commenting if you think about it) whereever you want to. i was watching the nba finals game 3.  i am sooo incredibly glad the pistons won.  i hate the lakers, seriously hate them.  especially devean george annoys me.  he is like a leech that just hangs onto kobe and shaq, and then when he needs to contribute, he cant step it up.  when detroit went on a run in the 3rd, rip was running a break after a board, and george was trying to guard him, but he is too slow, so he just flopped.  thankfully he didnt get the call, but i cant stand players like that (see vlade divac).  anyway, the only laker i really respect is kobe.  at least he tries all the time, unlike his team for the most part.  he really is a great player.  now that i think about it, i dont have much against shaq.  i just hope the pistons can pull this off.  on a side note, has anyone seen that viagra commercial with the fat and old guys jumping around with queen 'we are the champions' playing in the background?  if you think about it, there are some disgusting implications there.  i get so sick whenever i think about it.  therefore, i will try to make you sick as well. sorry, its too late to change anything.  i believe i will go get some sleep now.  have a great friday, now that it is officially friday.

549,Scorpio,"               It All Makes Sense Now!!    As you all know, I've been writing Silly Songs (aptly named Silly Songs with Sarah) for awhile now. To the unenlightened, Silly Songs are basically ditties that just pop into my head once in awhile, outta blue, totally off-guard. They could be lyrics to well-known songs (a la Weird Al Yankovic) or just, well, songs with a tune.  Here's a sample:   (To the tune of Kylie's 'I Just Can't Get You Outta My Head')   I just can't get you outta my spleen Boy oh boy do I need anti-fungal cream   Also:   (To the tune of P.O.D.'s 'Alive')   I can't see at night For the very first time I believe I am blind So blind  I can't drive past nine Otherwise I'll die But night blindness is fine So fine     Anyways, I just came across, in one of my readings, a man named Philip J.

551,Scorpio,"   “Love is not a fire to be shut up in a soul. Everything betrays us: voice, silence, eyes; half-covered fires burn all the brighter.” --Jean Racine  Orestes, in Andromache  “Speak low if you speak love.” --William Shakespeare Much Ado About Nothing    B. conversation.   Before ordering that perfect speech pattern for your next luncheon, it is helpful to note that communication styles may vary.  Your host for example, prefers two of the trendier patterns.     Pattern one : an opaque and semi-detached style. But still, it is very user friendly and durable enough for daily wear.  He relies on this mode of conversation for everyone—everyone except you, of course.     Pattern two : a more translucent, flowery style rich with sensuous adjectives, nouns, and verbs. Equipped with specialized volume, tone, and intimacy control, this pattern allows easy access to all comfort zones.   Pattern  two  can be especially effective when discussing close friends, and “poetry, music, beaches, and dancing.”        It is best to keep in mind that  pattern two  is just for you alone, and is subject to change. If your best friend has unintentionally snubbed the two of you for lunch, he might suggest in a very soft and slow voice, “We should tell her that I packed a picnic, a picnic of.......of fresh fruits...........a baguette.......a bottle of wine......and some cheese...”  Never mind the fact, that your best friend does not drink wine, nor does she have a strong preference for the very romantic foundations of French cuisine.  As usual take the necessary precautions: hands free of all sharp objects, and air passages clear.  Also, you might want to avoid his extended gaze after the word, “fruits,” should your lips begin to quiver. As an extra precaution, place one hand directly over your mouth and turn your face slightly to the left, focusing on the NO SMOKING sign located on the back wall.  Should your best friend arrive at the next luncheon, and he happens to tell her, “last week I planned a picnic,” with a smile meant for you, do not be alarmed when the traditional French food transforms into “Just goodies.”  Certainly, your best friend already knows what he said to you last week, but a true friend is curious if he will, in fact, reveal the contents of the picnic once more.  After pressing him with a suggestion of, “Chicken or??”  He will simply reply, “Just goodies. I wanted to bring goodies,” while looking at you intently. Under such circumstances, you may forget to wonder what happened to the fruit, cheese, wine and bread.    If your host finds himself in a tight situation, where he must make a rapid shift from  pattern two  back to  pattern one , he should be able to do so with relative ease. While the two of you are discussing your reading of Mario Vargas Llosa’s, “The Secret Life of Alejandro Mayta,” and you happen to reveal that you do not exactly care for the author’s style, but you find his vivid description of Peru’s beaches, and mountain towns quite stirring, you can expect your host's immediate proposal of “I’d like to teach a class like that, you know, on Latin American music, poetry, beaches and dancing,” to be equally arousing.  Be sure to smile, agree, and insist on being in the class so as to reach full dotage capacity.   But should your sociology professor abruptly interrupt the conversation as an uninvited guest, he will make the switch rather gracefully when he explains, “I was just telling her that I need to teach a class on Latin American culture...”  Again, while he is speaking, expect his eyes to remain solely on you and through you as if he is all too familiar with the very corridors of your soul.  However, be mindful that you are now in the presence of unsolicited company; try to remove all excess of red from your face, and do cool down with a sip of tea or diet Pepsi before turning to greet your guest. After all, you don’t want your sociology professor thinking “History is your favorite subject.”             And always remember: “Speak low if you speak love...”               Next--guests: guess who is coming to lunch?

553,Aries,           two-bit thimble rigger         
554,Aquarius,"                 Since graduating from college last year, one of the greatest pleasures I have discovered is reading. That may sound odd, considering that I was an English major and did nothing but read (and write about what I read) for a good four years. The difference is, now I can read whatever I want to, and I can do it at my own pace. I've re-read a lot of the books I had read hurriedly for classes and discovered new ideas I missed the first time. I've re-read the entire works of Orson Scott Card and was reminded of why I fell in love with his writing at the age of 13. Yesterday on my way to take a bath (ah, the luxury of my life!) I picked up my copy of  The Red Tent  by Anita Diamant. I enjoyed it the first time I read it several years ago, and this time it took hold of me so completely that I didn't even notice the bath water growing cold around me until my cat jumped up onto the side of the tub and peered down at me like I was crazy.   The Red Tent  is a fictional retelling of Genesis 34, the story of Dinah the daughter of Jacob. Following the Jewish tradition of midrash, Diamant makes Dinah the narrator of her own story. In a simple but poetic voice, Dinah recounts the history of her family. Some aspects are familiar - the jealousy between Leah and Rachel, Jacob's wrestling with the angel, the sons of Jacob slaughtering the men of Shechem.  The difference is Dinah's voice. She speaks to the reader as if to a friend sitting in the same room. 'We have been lost to each other for so long,' she says in the prologue. 'My name means nothing to you. My memory is dust. This is not your fault, or mine. The chain connecting mother to daughter was broken and the word passed to the keeping of men, who had no way of knowing.' The heart of her story is in the traditions of her mothers, Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah. She tells about the work of their daily life: gardening, tending animals, cooking, spinning wool, carrying water, making beer. At a young age she becomes a midwife and learns how to use herbs, incantations, and birthing bricks to help mothers deliver their babies.  She also describes the religious traditions of the women, which were completely separate from those of the men. Long before the revelation of the ten commandments and the injunction to 'have no other gods before me,' Diamant speculates that the women likely worshipped a pantheon of goddesses. Some of those mentioned are Gula, goddess of healing, Taweret, goddess of maternity and childbirth, and Innana, the Great Mother and the Queen of Heaven.  The center of the women's spiritual lives is the red tent, the place where they gather together to separate themselves from the men while menstruating or giving birth. Far from being a punishment for impurity, this was a time of rejoicing and celebrating life; as Leah puts it, 'In the red tent, the truth is known. In the red tent, where days pass like a gentle stream, as the gift of Innana courses through us, cleansing the body of the last month's death, preparing the body to receive the new month's life, women give thanks -- for repose and restoration, for the knowledge that life comes from between our legs, and that life costs blood.'  The women's lives revolve around fertility, pregnancy, and childbirth. The first time I read the story, I was fascinated by this at an intellectual level. Diamant provides many details about the herbs the women used for contraception, the prayers they uttered to induce labor, and the lengths they went to in order to achieve pregnancy. I guess it shouldn't have surprised me that this time, my interest was much more personal. I cried as I read the story of Rachel, who was infertile for many years before finally conceiving. 'Rachel could not smile at her sister while her own body remained fruitless. She was often away from the family's tents, seeking the counsel of Inna, who had a seemingly endless list of concoctions and strategies to open her womb. Rachel tried every remedy, every potion, every rumored cure. She wore only red and yellow -- the colors of life's blood and the talisman for healthy menstruation. She slept with her belly against trees said to be sacred to local goddesses. Whenever she saw running water, she lay down in it, hoping for the life of the river to inspire life within her ... But all these things did nothing for Rachel's womb.'  I relate to her feelings of desperation, to her willingness to try anything. That's the same thing I feel as I give myself shots each day and go to seeminlgy endless doctors appointments. And I count myself lucky that I was born in a time when effective treatments are available to me.  But there is something they had then that is missing now. Inside the red tent, the women care for one another and remind each other of the miracle of their bodies. While giving birth, the woman in labor is held up on three sides by her sisters while a midwife catches the baby. After the baby is born, they all care for the newborn and the mother until she is well enough to resume her normal life. The world we live in now is very different. Fertility treatments are not discussed openly, and are often kept a secret. Women give birth in hospitals with a husband and often no other women in the room. When she goes home with a new baby, she does it alone, unless she is lucky enough to have a mother who lives near by who can help. We live our lives largely separate from the support of other women. And at this particular time in my life, I grieve that loss.  Dinah speaks from the past, reminding us of the stories that are missing and urging us to remember them. 'And now you come to me -- women with hands and feet soft as a queen's, with more cooking pots than you need, so safe in childbed and so free with your tongues. You come hungry for the story that was lost. You crave words to fill the great silence that swallowed me, my mothers, and my grandmothers before them...It is terrible how much has been forgotten, which is why, I suppose, remembering seems a holy thing.' At the end of the book, Dinah leaves us with a promise that if we remember her story we won't be alone. 'Blessings on your eyes and on your children. Blessings on the ground beneath you. Wherever you walk, I go with you.'              "

558,Cancer,"       That's what I hit yesterday evening when I went to get some new books to read.  Some days I go in and am lucky to walk out with one or two books.  Some days it's 10 or 12.  And when it's one or two it really sucks because I read fast, like a book a day (sometimes two or three if they are short and I am bored).  I am really thankful for the new online access to the card catalog that our library has because it enables me to seek out books before I even step foot in the library.  That and the hold function allows me to get on the list for new books and not have to wait eons for them.  Yesterday I was able to go to the library all by me onesies since Mom was here to watch the kiddos so I got to do it the old-fashioned way.  I do love wandering the rows.

560,Scorpio,"       So... I had another one of those dreams last night...  except this time it was {or at least I was telling myself it was} my fault.  Bobby and I were driving somewhere... on the highway, and all of a sudden a car come flying up an exit ramp, and of course, we were right at the end of the ramp, and I was boxed in, so there wasn't anywhere I could go.  It was like it was in slow motion, and I could see the car coming careening drunkenly at 100 miles an hour towards Bobby.{no not towards us... towards Bobby, that's what I was thinking.} The other car slammed into Bobby's side of the car, and we got pushed into the car on my side too... so I've got blood all over me, and I can see Bobby disgustingly mangled... so I pick up my cell phone, and call 911, but I'm so disoriented I have no idea where we are, so all I can do is cry   Help me, help me, help me help me help me, and then I blacked out.  Then I woke up in the hospital,and there were all these people in my room, and it was all white... {reminds me of a Sylvia Plath poem... I'll look it up  in a minute}  but the second I realized what happened I was screaming for Bobby... WHERE IS HE????  BOBBY  BOBBY... WHERE IS HE??  and everybody just sort of looked at each other, and somebody was said something like 'hes in a better place now...'  I was sobbing, sort of chanting under my breath... no.. no. no. no.. I woke up choking on my tears/screams... Its a good thing nobody was home to hear me.    "

I took it as easy today as a Type A personality driven person can when they're sick (that means the house still got cleaned and dinner made before Ked got home!)  Last night Ked's cousin Kristin called to let us know that she had a basketball game nearby tonight. Ked was able to get off work a little early and the two of us headed over to the game. It was in a small gym with a concrete floor and reminded us of a gym you might see at a camp. Every time a girl fell and we heard that screech of skin on the floor we cringed with sympathy pain! We were about the only fans there for Kristin's Lions and we had a blast cheering them on. She scored 5 points and her team won by 20. Well, the game ended pre-maturely in the 4th quarter with about 6 minutes to go. The opposing team had three girls get hurt on that unforgiving concrete, and they were forced to finish play since they only had three girls left! We were glad Kristin invited us, and we think it meant a lot to her that we could come. After all, this is the type of stuff that counts in life - being there for people that you love. If it means taking off work a little early to show someone that they are important enough for you to take time to show up, it's worth it.  Go Lions!               "

577,Virgo,"       http://www.boston-online.com/glossary.html Pronunciation There I was, in the middle of the jungle in Guatemala, on the top of the tallest temple in Tikal. It was a beautiful sunset. Suddenly, from the other side of the temple, I heard 'Renee, Renee, come around to the noahth side. That's wheah all the monkeys ah!' Sure enough, after we climbed down the temple I asked where they were from: Buhlington, of coahse.'  -- Isobelw  Some comments about being a Bostoner abroad (further out than Worcester): People think I'm from New York. Once they hear I'm from Boston, they tell me some god-awful boring story of the time they went to Boston back in 1963 and how nice it was. When you say 'aunt,' people mock you by acting like you're some sort of blueblood. 'Oh, Buffy, there's our AHNT.' Puleeaase!  -- Christine Leccese  Yes, Bostonians really do drop their Rs after As, just like the Pepperidge Fahm Man.  But there's a lot more to the accent than that! It's not just after the A's that the R's go away. They disappear after other vowels as well, particularly 'ee' sounds, so that one could properly argue that 'Reveah is wicked wee-id' (translation: 'Revere is unusual'). Christine Leccese explains the profound effect this can have on one's life: 'I was 17 and reading a driver's ed. book before I realized that the mirror that hung from the windshield in the car was the REAR VIEW mirror. After hearing my family call it the 'reahview' my whole life, I thought it was REview mirror - so that you could review what you just passed, naturally.'  Don't worry about poor lost New England R's, however. In typical Yankee fashion, we re-use 'em - by sticking them on the ends of certain other words ending with 'uh' sounds: 'Ah final ahs just disappeah, but wheah they go we've no idear.'  But wait, it gets more complex. As seasoned Boston English speakah Alan Miles has gently tried to pound into a poor Nooyawka's thick head, that missing R only reappears when the word is followed by another word that starts with a vowel, for example: 'I have no idear if the movie begins at nine or ten,' but, 'Does the movie begin at 9 or 10? I have no idea.' Hey, just like French! Leccese, the Boston driver, also grew up wondering about the phrase 'catchers catch can.'  Jonathan E. Dyer notes this rule is nullified for certain words ending in 'ure' such as 'rapsha' (extreme joy) and 'capsha' (what you do with a flag).   Also like French (and German), Boston English has an almost-R sound that is very difficult for most other Americans to reproduce. You'll hear it in words with an 'er' sound. In Boston, the ordinal number after 'second' is pronounced, roughly, 'thihd.' Try saying it as if you meant to pronounce the R but then thought better of it.  In Boston English, 'ah' (the one without an R after it) sometimes becomes something closer to 'aw', so that, for example, 'tonic' comes out more like 'tawnic' (former Mayor Kevin White would often express outrage by exclaiming 'Motheragawd!'). In other cases, however, it assumes a British pronunciation, as in 'ahnt and 'bahthroom,' says Carrie-Anne Dedeo, a native of B'rica (which is how you pronounce 'Billerica' around here).  Bostonians, like Nooyawkas, often leave out consonants in their rush to get words out, in particular, d's and t's at the end of words. So 'so don't I' is more properly pronounced 'So doan I,' real-estate brokers babble on about houses with plenny a chahm and we get such phrases as onna-conna. Also like Nooyawkas, Bostonians often change the 's' at the end of words to a a 'z.' 'I toll you already, I can't go out on Tuesdiz, 'caz that's when I got practiz,' as Don Hurter recalls.   However, Ds at the end of words ending in 'id' sounds end up as Ts, so that, for example, 'wicked' comes out as 'wicket.'  But sometimes, Bostonians add consonants, as well. Jeff W. recalls: 'My father, who grew up in Brighton in the 1940s and 50s, adds the letter 'n' to the words 'out' and 'outside.' It's sort of a slum version of the Boston accent, as I've heard others from that time and place use it. Therefore, I grew up saying things like, 'Ya wanna go ountside in the yahd?' 'Let's find ount who's going.'   And one-syllable words with long-I sounds, such as 'mine,' often turn into two-syllable words: 'Gimme back that curlin' eye-yen, it's MAYAN!' (as Douglas K. Lennan notes). Bostonians also sometimes add H's to the beginning of words that begin with a vowel, reports Jo: 'We buy our hundaweah at Hames.'  Finally, in certain blue-collar communities on the North Shore, speakers sometimes replace Rs with, of all things, Vs, reports John Lawler, who provides an example: 'Tevesah doesn't have any bvains, she's from Veveah.'

578,Cancer,"       Have no idea where this came from. I know it is not poetry. Simply a conscious stream. And I played with the color.   Honeybee  Thoughts of a clean frozen river of metal cutting a path Directly into my skin are haunting my mind again Like some recurrent nightmare from hell That doesn’t want to see its one potential convert Denying its existence, and making it blow away With a sigh, with the wind like some malodor hanging In the slipstream of air as it rushes by my eyes and ears Smelling again of  blood , more  blood , the sap That doesn’t taste so sweet in my mouth, yet somehow I can lick the red drop off my finger and not recoil In the disgust that I should be exhibiting toward That vampire, that leech hiding and feeding off the Benevolent ghosts that seem to shake, shiver, quake When I wake in the middle of the night to a phantom alarm A mystical tune that was never really there to begin with And realize that it sounds like a horrid clash of memories Subconsciously reliving the very fluctuation of that voice As it slips past me in honeyed words that hide the  spark  The subtle spark of awakening, no one has yet found But here I am, trying to wake up from a netherworld That has me on the rack each time I think clearly Eating at the back of my brain, and moving inwards And then it will turn downwards, and chew through My spinal column, and into each organ that creates What I thought to be me, for a long time Some cancer that can’t be diagnosed at any hospital People hate it, and for a damn good reason Because it enervates one, and the afflicted ends up Suffering convulsions by the bathroom sink, and Frantically rubbing his arms to get the circulation To move again, to slice through the debilitating  cold  Because the thermometer is dropping too fast The antithesis of a fever, caused by realization That he is alone, he is different, because only he Will drag the smooth edge of a dagger across his skin And only he will consciously try to escape a crowd And only he crawls into a honeycomb of self-spun Delusions of depression and isolation As a number of other recluses scuttle into the honeycomb To be with him, because they too fear the norm And amongst the aliens, I am blinded in cold flashes Waiting for your voice to arrest my fingers Your lips to melt the  ice  that forms about my eyes I sink into a sleep, with the smooth skin of your hands Even if they are ethereal, and even if just the lull in dreams Resting on my shoulders, passing into my bloodstream The miniscule particles that ward off the virus infecting my Sanity.

581,Aries,"                 What you are about to read is a “Quick Write”. A “Quick Write” is an activity we did in my eighth grade English class. Our teacher gives us a topic to write about. We get a generally short time limit to write as much as we can about this topic keeping it as legible as we can. In this “Quick Write” the topic was My Best Friend. We were to describe our best friend, or if you didn’t have one, you could write about what your best friend would be like. That was my circumstance.  My best friend would be a great person, perfect in my eyes. He’d be easy to talk to. He’d always listen and He’d be great at giving advice. I wouldn’t be afraid to tell Him my deepest, darkest secrets; I’d know He would keep them. He would not be judgmental. My best friend would never ask why I am the way I am, or why I do the things I do; He would already know. He would be extremely intelligent. I would never have to explain myself to Him; He’d simply accept everything. He would never be bitter at me for my wrong doings, but would always praise me for the things I do right. He’d be the only one with an unconditional love for me. He would never play favorites; He’d treat everyone as equals. Above all, my best friend would be a Christian, a healthy Christian who was very close to God. He’d be my best friend.  It was not until when I read it aloud to my mother when I noticed I chose my best friend to be male. I couldn’t explain why. Then she pointed out that every time the nameless friend was mentioned, I had capitalized the pronoun. That’s pretty uncommon in the English language, unless of course you are referring to God or Jesus. Read the “Quick Write” again. Doesn’t it seem to describe God/Jesus?                "
582,Scorpio,"               Emily of Emerald Hill  Impressions of the lady sitting 2 rows behind us:   Emily (played by Ivan Heng)  says something  Lady behind us : Mmmmmm.....  Emily  says something else  Lady behind us : Mmmmmm....  Emily  asks everyone if they know the recipe for Pineapple Tarts  Lady behind us : Pineapple, sugar, er, mmmmm......  It was excruciating.  Other than that, the play was hilarious and Ivan Heng was great as everyone's favourite Peranakan Bibik. Especially when Emily started interacting with the audience, and pulled this woman on stage as she was getting to her seat (she was late - thank God we got to the theatre just as they were closing the doors). Made her stand in the corner while everyone laughed, but the woman was laughing too, and enjoying herself. She was finally allowed to return to her seat though, after apologising to the 'class'.   Should've been the lady sitting behind me. Mmmmm......           "
583,Aquarius,"                 Friday night we went to our first class for the Public Access TV station.Well, actually it was an orientation. We thought last week was orientation, but apparently that was pre-orientation! We're still not sure what we'll do for a t.v. program, but we're praying about it and starting to toss some ideas around in our heads. It really struck me when the instructor told us that we had a possible audience of 500,000. There's a lot of weight and responsibility there. Ked and I had prayed that we would move to a community that needed some of the Light and that we would be able to impact the community for Christ. We're definitely in an area in desperate need of Light and well, this just could be a medium to do some good with! The station is on the local basic cable on channels 19 and 20, which is awesome to be in the lower numbers - there's a better chance more people will stop on your program. The next class isn't until early May and that will be t.v. graphics. Ked is really excited about that one, naturally. In the meantime we've signed up to help with the Community Desk which means we can get hands on training while helping other producers with various community events such as parades, sports, religious events. We think it will be a great way to get involved in the community and get a feel for this public t.v. thing.  Tonight (Saturday) we went over to the Carrs in Winter Haven. Ked's Grandma and Grandpa have been visiting from Michigan and we made the 45 minute drive to hang out with them. We had a yummy KFC (which is Kitchen Fresh, not Kentucky Fried now!) dinner and a great time visiting with the fam. It's nice to have family close by! It's definitely made the transition easier for us.  One last bit of news. The site Ked did for his Uncle Ben is now live. Please, please, go visit  urlLink www.bencarrfamily.com  and tell other people about the site. Pray with us that this will be a tool God will use to generate prayer and financial support for this very special family. The site will give you Ben's story as well as ways that you can get involved including current prayer requests, a link to send a message of encouragement, and how to make a financial donation. Thank you!  Good night (or is it morning!!)               "
584,Aquarius,"                 that's all i want to say to youuuuu.  &nbsp;  Ok maybe not just that. I got a lot done today, fever seems to be almost gone. Had most of the day to myself which was kind of nice. Did some yard work,a lot of&nbsp;cleaning, some resting...then got a phone call that my precious was not comfy where she was having a sleep over and wanted to come home. That's ok though we can try another time.  &nbsp;  I'm a little nervous about going back to work, but I still have a bit more time. I will go back to needing to catch up on so much and take account for the time and targets I missed. I think it's going to be ok, I feel like i have a better sense of purpose now. Maybe I just need to get primal and kill that fear.

592,Pisces,"       ....................... The Psino .......................  I was never sure why I was a psino (silent p); if it was something i had done; something i should be embarrassed about or something that was generally true of everyone.    it was certainly true of everyone that was in my sunday school classes.   Jesus loves me, the psino, for the bible tells me so.   Perhaps 'psino' was a theological term describing the comprehensiveness of original sin?  It was a ridiculously long time before I figured out my error.   this, I know.  and i thought of it this weekend when Jaelyn asked me and Lynn very insistently and repetitively:   'What is Cruisey - Violence?'  It took a lot of conversation to realize that this was her take on the crowds maelovelent chant in the JESUS film (which she's been watching) as they chant, 'crucify him!'

603,Libra,"        Listening to: So Much Soul (Volume 2) by Vinroc   So I've been pretty busy the past month or so.  Just one thing after another.  Not a bad busy, though.  Today was my day off.  I had a day off last week--the 40th day of mourning since Mama passed away.  I don't know if the 40th day thing is a Filipino or Catholic thing, but I took the day off to reflect on my own, since I'm not Catholic.  I realized last Wednesday that although I still miss Mama terribly, lately (because I've had so much work to do, and have been busying myself by hanging out with my friends) it doesn't  hurt  to miss Mama.  I am still wearing her wedding and engagement rings to remind me of her.  I don't know when I'll be taking them off, but for now I like having the reminder--like she's always with me.  I went to see Fahrenheit 911 today at the Metreon, by myself.  My eyes teared up a few times.    The first instance was in the beginning, before the shots of 9/11 came on, before Michael Moore showed reactions of people watching the planes fly into the WTC.  It brought me back to the trauma of that day, how surreal and scary it was for me, even though I was far removed from it all.  I was grateful Moore didn't show any footage of the planes actually flying into the buildings.  I remember that day--I was at school, watching a TV in the library, and I started crying as I watched people jumping out of windows in the WTC.  The second time I started tearing up during the film was when Moore showed Iraqis condemning American troops and President Bush for killing civilians.  There was an older woman lamenting the senseless death of her brother and the bombing of his home.  It was like she had the same exact words to convey how I feel about the loss of my mom, even though my loss is a result of something different.  Cancer, war--both senseless losses to me.  Mama was a beautiful person who fought for a long time.  I'm still trying to make sense of why she was taken from me.  Yeah, walking out of Fahrenheit 911, I felt really disturbed about American politics/government.  I'm pretty apathetic about politics, but I do my best to stay informed so my opinions aren't half-assed.  During the film was the first time in a long time that I felt really compelled to  do something .  Anyhow.  I just spoke to Daddy today; he's coming up to the Bay Area for the 4th of July holiday weekend.  It will be the first time for him to visit me here since I was a freshman living in the dorm.  Even then, we didn't get to spend time together.  I just remember getting a random call from him that he was in town for a few days.  He came by my dorm and dropped off a TV and VCR for me, gave me some pocket change--and he was gone.    I'm excited--this time I hope to take him out to eat, walk around, whatever.  I didn't get to spend time with him when I was in San Diego at the beginning of the month.  Daddy's not very adventurous about food, and lots of things are  bawal  for him (not good for him to eat; can trigger his gout).  But maybe Daddy will like real Thai food (there's no real Thai food in Bakersfield), or even Burma Superstar?    We'll see.    "
604,Leo,"           So, Here is the first entry into my  Blogger  powered pseudo-journal. wait - meta-journal. no... um... 'Journalesque Stream Of Thought.' (Journalesque Stream Of Thought &copy; 1972 eclipse studios) So, if this works, I shall have a place on my website which I can use to post random thoughts that wouldn't quite fit into anything else. I already have a section for this (core), but that is more for structured rants and such. At this point in time I would like to say 'Eugene' 4 times: Eugene Eugene Eugene Eugene. I would also like to state that Escargot is a really bad name for snails. They should be labeled 'Snails' in bold print. just to let you know, so you don't order them while trying to show off for a date or something ('Ah kin reed fraynch, gimme one of them thar escargots').

608,Aquarius,"       There is this guy I know, but he shall remain nameless, although I might be related to him.  I adore this guy.  He is one of the funniest people I know and whenever I am around him I know that we will be laughing so hard that we fall over.  However, last night I discovered he is the biggest dork I know.  And this is why.    We both love Apple.  We are both obsessed with Apple.  Like last week I emailed him about the new  urlLink Apple Airport Express  and he emails me back and is like “I was reading about it just when you emailed.”  And then the next day he calls me and we chat for like half an hour about how the world really needs to know that Apple is so superior and really people would be happier if they just owned an Apple and businesses were run on Apples.  We discover it is a futile attempt, but our love for Apple will never die.  This guy is a certified Windows programmer and even interviewed for a job at Microsoft so his love for Apple is even more special than mine.  He converted about 4 years ago and has not looked back since.  In fact, he’s a little pissed at people who like PCs.  He loves Apple so much that he gets magazines about Apple and somehow is in the loop of rumors about the new products they are creating. I know there are rumor websites and he probably surfs them.  It’s all a business related obsession since he programs all day. I have to confess that if I understood all that computer jargon, I would be in on it too.  I just don’t have time to learn all that stuff about computers, I just know I love Apple.  I also know that he is my Apple lovin' hero and he is there to dispense knowledge should I have a technical quetions.  He rocks my Apple lovin' world.    Well, so last night he was telling me about the last issue of  urlLink Mac World .    urlLink Alton Brown gave an interview and developed a special recipe to celebrate Apple.  The name of the dish is APPLE MACaroni and Cheese.  “Ew,” he said.  “Yeah, weird,” I said.  Then, this guy that I adore,went on to tell me that at the last Mac Expo (or whatever) when Steve Jobs gave his closing statement, he had a friend over to his house during their lunch hour and they watched it on the internet while eating MACaroni and then for dessert they had APPLEsauce.  Oh, dear one, I still, still, adore the hell out of you!           "
609,Sagittarius,"        Miscellaneous Observations  First of all, many thanks to my readers who have made a donation for the AIDS Walk this Sunday.  I'm walking a little over 3 miles and have raised more than my goal of $100.  And for the first time in doing this sort of thing, I think that's pretty darn good!  If you feel the need to do some good, there's still time to  urlLink Support Your Diva!    Observation:  None of my most intimate male friends *wink wink* have made any donations.  As always, the most supportive males in my life are not the ones I have, um... 'relations' with.   Why is that?      As far as I can tell, they don't even read my blog.  Wouldn't you think it would be a good idea to read?  Hmmph.   Observation:  I've come to the realization that I am very content just the way things are.  Well, money is still an issue, but I'm not lonely or in need of male companionship.  For a while there I was thinking 'Poor Diva.  All alone in the world without a man to call her own.'  BAH!  Over that! I curled up in my big queen-size bed last night, snuggled up to my huggie pillow and felt very content as I drifted off to sleep.  It was a very good feeling.  Of course now that I'm happiest without a man, they'll all start crawling out of the woodwork again.  That's pretty much how that works.  They just can't stand to see you happy!    Observation:  I read on a blog the other day, I think it was on 'Was it the Pagan Remark?' about a little man bashing.  Just a little.  Nevermind how very strongly I agreed with just about all of it.  I started having thoughts of my own.   * Younger men who like older woman haven't had any of the experiences yet always think they know everything. * I'm tired of men who need coddling.  These men either always have an excuse for why they didn't or couldn't do what they were supposed to do, poor babies.  In the meantime, I'm getting it done.  No excuses.  Make it happen.  But they just can't.  And there seem to be more than a few men like this around me.  It's becoming annoying.   Observation:  I've been so concerned about treating my youngest diva with nuturing love, as a baby that I've sort of overlooked my oldest little diva.  I've always had a tendency to treat her more like an adult than a child, and lately I'm seeing that she needs a little more nuturing.  She's growing up; maybe that's why I'm noticing.    Ok.  Observations over for now.  I feel like I should say something very wise and philosophical right now, but all I can think of is, 'I need another cup of coffee.'   Hmm... go thee out and seek thy coffee.   There.  Wise and philosophical.  Diva out.              "
610,Virgo,"               I just read a post on a certain person's journal, concerning a certain song.  Now I have the damned song going around MY head!  I do quite like the song in question tho, even if I can't remember who it's by.  It's 'Tracks of my Tears' by the way, and now I'm really annoyed that I can't remember who it's by.  Can anyone help?   I have also decided that I'm going to try and write a book of politically correct proverbs and sayings.  Of course, to do that I need to find a lot of proverbs and sayings, so I might have to go out and buy a normal book so I can translate them into politically correct speak.  How much money do you think I could make out of this???  Things to be grateful for:  1.  Silly Ideas 2.  Old Ideas developed into new ones 3.  Potato croquets         "

614,Cancer,                 So after using Blockbuster online for a week I have seen no real difference between it and Netflix. The only thing I can say is that with Blockbuster you get two free in store video rentals and it is a few dollars cheaper. With both companies I get movies in 1 to 2 days time and ones I return are credited the next day. Is that enough to make me leave Netflix? Not quite yet! :-)       
615,Scorpio,"       Mendel and I, along with his brother, Freud, had planned to go to Punta Fuego, a resort located in far out Batangas, to check the scenery. Apparently, Freud happens to be a propertly consultant for LandCo (owners and developers of Punta Fuego).  And so, last saturday, Mendel & I, along with Freud, and two of my bestest friends, Holen and Jason, decided to take the two hour ride along the winding roads and going in through the lush forest of Batangas.  We were toured in two spots: The Peninsula Punta Fuego and Terazzas de Punta Fuego.  The scene was spectacular. Lush Forest, an infinity of sea water, mountains from a distance, the development of the land was fantastic - It was paradise for a mere 2 hour ride. I could go there every weekend if i wanted to.  Along with the spectacular scenery, came also the ostentatious display of property, some owned by the old rich and some nouveaux riches. Huge lots of land, came with houses made up of 3 floors going down to the sea shore, big houses with lawns even.   At the highest peak of the mountain was a house where it is dubbed as the most expensive amongst all because of its 360 degrees view of the pacific ocean. The land cost about a billion, and the construction of the house cost about the same price. It is owned by one of the popular politicians of the Philippines. An Asian royalty, previously attached with one of the local celebrities, bought a 2 blocks of land, approximately about 160 hectares of land.  Do you know how much per sq.m. costs? P8,000. You do the math.  As i was there to witness the bounty of land that was given to the Philippines (sad that not a lot of us knows about it), i was a bit enraged about the idea that is being sold at high prices. Back then, land was free for all, and nature's beauty was meant to be enjoyed by all. Now, you'd have to pay a sum of money to enjoy mother nature.  On the other hand, i had a tinge of envy for the old rich and nouveaux riches because Punta Fuego, as beautiful as it is, was equivalent to money that i don't have. And even in the next 50 years, i would never ever be able to get that kind of money. It was too far-fetched. And even, it was close to reality, it meant that i had to be friends with people who had membership access to those kinds of places.  To make things worse, we were at the beach. Naturally, you bring your swimwear. We were so close to the water, and even smelled the salty breeze of the ocean sea, but was never allowed to swim in it. We were only there for a sight trip...it was the saddest of all the experiences. We took pictures. But that's all it'll ever be, pictures.  I have to erase Punta Fuego from my mind. Maybe, for my birthday, i'll go to Puerto Gallera. Now, that's more like it - the same 2 hour ride, a boat ride, rent a cottage and stay for a weekend, then i am in paradise.           "

617,Capricorn,"                 I just wrote this. It's not actually true, not at the moment. It's true sometimes, usually when I want to write fiction. It's in a slightly different style of poetry than usual, for me. It doesn't have any rhyme scheme or even a hint of meter. Anyway, here it is:    On Writing   by Abigail  I stare at an empty document, Wondering what to write.  No ideas coming. Lazily I start to type, But nothing comes out. Only words. No revolutionary ideas, Just a poem, by a nerd. It barely rhymes. I’ve got writer’s block, I guess. But maybe I’m no writer after all. Maybe this is the end of my writing career, Perhaps I’ve hit some immovable wall. What is writing, anyway? Possibly I never knew. I hope I’ll find out, someday. But what can I do? How can I find out, I mean. What happens when you want to write, But can’t.  I hate staring at an empty screen.       "
618,Gemini,"       well i decided that it would be easier to give a person a link when they want to know about me instead of taking forever to tell them about me i could just show them this here it goes..might take a while ok well my full name is Ashley Ann Smith my parents names are mike and belinda(lynn) i have two sisters named Heidi(19) and Christina(22) i love dogs i use to have a dog named sinbad but he was put to sleep because he bit to many people and my parents said he needed too because they are mean like that now i have a dog named roxie, Me and my sister Heidi get along better than my other sister but it all depends really  I also hate when my family tells the rest of thhe clan what i do, like one time i got really mad at my sister for trying to get me in trouble with my dad and i got really mad and punched her and then some how my grandma found out and she was like telling everyone that i punched her and was like 'your dad shouldnt have let you ungrounded' she is also very nosey and tells everyone everything and complains alot.  hmmmm my mother is a twin her twins name is pam and they have 8kids well 7 because she gave one up for adoption which is NEVER talked about no one really knows really because its something my grandma isnt proud of and most of my family members dont know we have another aunt... hmmm some of the things i hate are hair ITS SO GROSS i swear i hate hair floating around randomly it grosses me out lets seee.... iv only went out with one kid that was actaully in my grade that was my age they are all a year ahead of me and that was like in 6th grade, his name was dustin most of my friends are from mackinaw Chase is my best friend we know what each other is thinking and we know what we are going to say its kinda weird but cool, josh is her ex boyfriend hes kinda cool but changed alot since he hangs out with weridos, blake is my ex we went out twice hes cool but is kinda mean, jared we went out twice too, hes cool, ben, ohh kelsey, nick cox, brent w., hmm theres more im just not naming i have two friends from morton, adam hes very cool and then heather broy she use to go to my school but then left shes an interesting person hmmmm i listen to rock music i was really ugly up to 8th grade, not calling myself pretty now, but you know i look alot better than i use to, hmmm yeah i cut my hair really short in 6th grade BAD CHOICE then it let it grow out for a year and i looked like a dog heh which sucked hmmm i love concerts iv been to the v shape mind concert with like 4 other bands there, been to the smile empty soul, strata, sparta, finger 11, trapt, incubus, slipknot, slayer, godforbid, then those 4 other bands i mentioned but i dont remember their names heh i do i dont want to think though, i went crowd surfing at incubus which was super fun, hmmm In 8th grade we had a six flags trip that we were going to go on and it was the night before i was suppose to go i found out i needed surgery and I HAD TO MISS MY 8TH GRADE TRIP WITH EVERYONE it really pissed me off they were like, you need surgery 2marra and im like i cant, im busy lol and they looked at me like i was a witch and then was like NO you have to 2marra and i got really pissed and heh i cried it was really disapointing for me because i knew everyone would ask where i was  and i would have to say oh im sorry i had some dude opening me up and cuting on me while you were riding these GREAT rides i would love to tell you what the surgery was for but just ask me instead because i dont want to type it in here so just ask heh my birthday is june 2 i LOVE guy cloths matter of a fact im wearing their boxers RIGHT NOW they have stars on them they are soooo cool my favorite number is 11 and i play volleyball i have been playing volleyball for like 6years i am number 11,  play school and club volleyball...i am a setter i play the flute and violin but this was my last year of flute because i dont want to do it in highschool although my band teacher thought i should i jsut didnt want to i have been playing violin since like 4th grade and flute since 5th hmmm i dont know waht else to tell you i love shoping for underwear its super cool i have really cute ones that i just bought super cool ok i think i have ran out of things to say so im just going to go now later days        "
619,Virgo,       There is something to be said for people who dont know when to stop being jerks          
620,Pisces,"             Upon finishing the post below, something was nagging at me. Like I had forgotten something. And then it hit me.  Besides this week being the 10th anniversary of the first time Mark Mothasemi and I took to the stage with the teenage versions of Ash and Tom, a year ago this past weekend, the aggression played what will be most likely be their last ever show. From what I recall, it was a good gig, though honestly, we were always good (though we got REALLY good once Robin came in). We played here in the City and the other band no showed, so we were able to do our extended set without having to cut anything. it was sparsely attended, especially in comparison to our previous NYC shows, but it was hastily put together and we had just come back from Russia when the opportunity to play arose. While we had several gigs over the past 10 years that were supposed to be our last, the one time I didn't think was the last one, was in fact, THE LAST GIG EVER (TM). I've not seen a video of this gig because, according to Matt Gentile, the tape is 'fucked up'. I nag him occasionally about this, but there's a romanticism to never seeing it  I always felt like the aggression should have gone out like the end of Michael Mann's HEAT, in an overblown blaze of glory. That gig has been played over and over in my head millions of times. From what I would wear to what I would play, the gig was preconceived for the past few years. I don't think I was alone in that as I recall Ash having a set list for such a gig (as well as several drafted letters of resignation).  I was about to share with you my thoughts on what that gig should be. I've decided against it as I think what you are speculating might be better than what I had planned.   I thought I would be more emotional about it, but I guess I got over it more quickly than I anticipated. This could be because I remain in such close,  daily, contact with the people who did matter and worked hard to make the aggression something special. Another reason, and I can see this with time having passed, I was fucking miserable in the band thanks to the lack of focus and maturity within it. But if I am anything, I am loyal and I was the general who took the ship down to a noble death.  Let's be frank, we only sold a few thousand records, we were never even a blip on a radar. However, for ten years it was the world I and a few others lived in and while I can never forgive the few who tried to fuck with it,  I love that the music and the experiences will be something no one can ever take away or tarnish. I wanted to save the industrial scene when bands i adored like Chemlab and Skinny Puppy went away. With all of these old schoolers coming back and putting out records, I can rest easier knowing we kept our elders seats warm in their absence.   From the pits of the Underworld to the former Soviet Union, the casualty rate was shockingly low and most of the friendships remain intact. Plus, some records came out that I love to pieces. They proudly hang on my well as reminders of the wonderful life I have led for 10 years.  And don't think I don't seen the irony in the fact that the one of last songs the aggression ever played was in fact, Hypefactor's SWEETEST SOUL.  HAH.  F         "
621,Libra,"                 I had a dream that I came home and there were a dozen boxes of  Harry and David  pears on my doorstep.  Why am I subconsciously getting fruit delivered?  Maybe it's 'cause my mom hasn't ordered me any  Omaha Steaks  in a while.  I'm such a spoiled brat.    Okay so last year my brother got me these  Deisel  jeans and they're awsome, but I was fat then, and they're about 3 inches too big in the waist.  So now I look at myself in the mirror, and even though I'm swimming in these puppies I look fat.  But I'm done losing weight, and I can't aford to get another pair.  So here's my idea.  Do you think I can call my mom and ask if she'll pay for it?  I mean it's for my health.  Maybe not.    I was listening to the radio this morning and they were talking about fights at supermarkets. This pharmacist said that some guy came in with a forged prescription and he refused to fill it.  A few minutes later he was beaned by a can of  Ensure  I had to laugh, I can just picture it: 'To your health Fucker!' (Whooosh - Boink!) Hehe.             "
622,Libra,"         Forget me. It's that simple.   You say hate is such a strong word. And yet. I use it most often.  Coming from an agnostic person, I hope you should take my theory to heart. As Ive seen more sorrow than you religious pukes will ever. I see the normal human being. They belive what they've been taught from the start of their time. God Created them. And things are fine..as long as you have absolution. Others, who are agnostic, were (most likley) not grown up on religion. We just know that we are here, and we can do what we want with it. And thats life.  Well, sitting there the other day, I realized how sad I was, and all the while I was thinking, 'I bet the kid who prays before bed, has never been as down as this, and I bet he will never know what the end is like before it actually happens.' Then I put into my mind the prospective that if there was a lord that heals the wounded and aids the sorrow of the world, that wouldnt this be a fitting punishment for all the disbelivers?  If I were god, I would think so.  Im not saying the whole ordeal made me into a beliver, because it didnt. But it made me think. It's still making me think.  I hate thinking.   'Its funny how I found myself, and realized how I was played upon, from your game, but its MY life, dont you forget..'     "
623,Leo,"           Well, I've been on that there internet for a coon's age, and I've seen many things, some of which were quite entertaining, some of which would make a 60 year old tranvestite stripper cough up her 4th tequila and semen cocktail. Through all my journeying, however, I've found that there is one truth to the internet - one constant. One thing that we all need to see as the horrible problem it is, and that we must rise up to stop:   It's 'YOUR', as in 'Maybe a dingo ate your baby.', and 'YOU'RE', as in 'There's a party in my pants, and you're all invited.'   I cannot stress this enough. We as a society need to find all instances of this travesty, and squash it. We must rise up as one and find all those who propagate this abuse of the english language. Did we not take english class? Are we to the point where we can no longer distinguish between 'your' and 'you are'? I've been to all corners of this, the world wide web. I've seen the dark offramps and gutters lining the information superhighway, and this one thing keeps attacking. It's worse than any virus, it's more infectious than the hampster dance (or hamster, if you want to be snooty and spell it right). So many times I've seen an otherwise hopeful webpage throw itself away by using phrases such as 'Welcom to my webpage, your welcome to look around, but I created theses pages, so don't take whats not you'res'. Now the lack of the apostrophe I can deal with, but  the extra one ? Why? What caused you to add the extra punctuation, when you had previously omitted it? The only answer is sheer, blinding, painful stupidity. I know I don't use proper punctuation, and my grammar leaves much to be desired - but it's my style of writing. I write this way because I can express myself more efficiently this way. Saying 'your' where you should have said 'you're' is just wrong. 'you're' instead of 'your' is worse. 'your'e' or 'yo'ure' is just wrong regardless.  And now, some offensive rap lyrics: 'Tell your girl to stop changing her lipstick - I'm starting to get rainbows around my dick.' 'Face down, ass up - That's the way we likes to fuck.' '...and when I'm finished, there's gonna be a bloodbath of cops dying in L.A.. Yo dre, I got something to say: Fuck the police'         "
624,Sagittarius,        Just for Fred   urlLink The horoscope guy          
625,Leo,"             Welcome to Colorado..It is the second day of Summer, but it doesn't feel like summer at all!! The weather has been really gloomy for the past couple of weeks. It's always raining and the sun only comes out once in a while. Today in Fort Collins is 55F and it will drop tonight to 45F. The weather here is very 'unusual', because sometimes the weather can be really nice and sunny, but it can change very dramatically at night. Or it can be snowing the next day. I remember last year we had a very big storm after Spring break, so we actually got a two-week break from school!! That was nice, but I didn't like 'the walking in the snow' part. It's slippery and wet. No thanks!  Anyways, I just got home from work and feel like writing something on my blog. I've been working for 8-12 hours a day for almost everyday. I've been really busy. But, hey..I kinda need the money anyway, so that's alright. I have two jobs this summer, one in the dining service and one in the housing service on campus. I work in a dining hall for the students who live in a dorm. Basically what I do is just serving food or swiping their meal cards. It's not really bad. My second job is pretty easy and fun. I work for this organization called  urlLink CREATE  . My job is to create bulletin boards, posters, and display cases with different themes every month. They will be put inside the campus' dorms and apartments. We also organize and create events, which I always enjoy doing. I guess thanks to 'redlight'.   I didn't take any classes this summer, so I can work a lot. But still..I have to finish my research proposal for my thesis. It's almost done, but I'm still too lazy to finish it. I decided to do a research on 'The Ethical Issues of Downloading Music via the Internet.' Do I download music? Yes..hehe, why do we have to buy music CDs if they are available on the Net? I guess I shouldn't be saying that.   By the way, yesterday was father's day, so  'Happy Father's Day'  to all dads!! I don't know why we don't have father's day in Indonesia. We have hari ibu on December 22 and hari anak-anak on July 1, but we never celebrate hari bapak. Why is that? Don't you think that your dad needs appreciation too? That is so weird. I want to get my dad something. I already know what he probably wants, but don't know when I can give it to him, because I don't really want to send the gift by mail. First, it's too expensive. Second, I don't want to lose it in the mail.   Anyway, I found this really sweet quote on the Net:   a father is someone that  holds your hand at the fair makes sure you do what your mother says holds back your hair when you are sick brushes that hair when it is tangled because mother is too busy lets you eat ice cream for breakfeast  but only when mother is away he walks you down the aisle and tells you everythings gonna be ok   -Unknown      Enjoy your night, everyone!!

I feel very reserved because so many family members and friends read this site (who am I kidding, I shouldn't flatter myself), but I do know that two important people do regularly... Jessica and Ellie, and even if just those two read - I guess I AM flattered.  Today I am proud of how I have been eating. For breakfast I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich (actually that was at about 5AM this morning when I woke up and I was starving cause it was too hot to eat last night. Then I had part of a bagel with cream cheese (bad) but then for lunch I had a very sensible chicken sandwich (and a chocolate chip cookie - bad). So maybe I'm not so proud :) - At least I'm not eating fistfuls of chocolate from the nice ladies in the front of the office. That was last week.   I have been printing out lists of galleries and instructions for submitting work for display. As soon as I actually think of starting the process of dropping off my work I get paralyzed. I can't seem to get past that point. I have a major self-confidence crisis. MAJOR. Got to work through it.      "

634,Sagittarius,"       Happiness is not something you postpone for thefuture;&nbsp;it is something you design for the present.  Happiness is not an accident. Nor is it something youwish for. Happiness is something you design. The greatest source of unhappiness comes from inside.  Happiness is the art of learning how to get joy from your substance.   Lets take for example our relationships -   If your relationship doesn't have adestination, how will you know when and where you reach ?   Good relationships are no accident. Tough times can strike any relationship - family, professional or friendship. But deciding to be responsible and 'happy' in practical ways can result in relationships that are tougher than tough times.  Think about this. We see around many couples want to'fix' problems, but don't know how to reach it.  The most common and most fundamental thing these couples are lacking is the knowledge that - happy relationships is a decision. If you look at it from this perspective, you'd agree that love is not a feeling of a particular moment but it's a decision.  Love is waking up every day committed to honoring yourpartner for being with you. If you want to have a great relationship, it's up to you. If you want to be happy, it's up to you!          "
635,Gemini,"           Hey I love the TV in a way that's hard to explain. Sometimes I feel more intimate with it than I ever could a woman. Even bea Arthur.  But Bea Arthur on television, now then we'd have something.  But occasionally I have to step away from the picture tube.  But don't fret. Usually it's just to go to the movies. Now, lately there's been a movie event that has just rocked my small 2D world. Kill Bill. Honest to god, I can't think of a more perfect film that wasn't Pulp Fiction.  Okay, maybe Flashdance, but that's another issue altogether.  Every few years a movie comes along and I find myself completely obsessed. It's pretty rare I'll see the same movie at the cinemas more than once, but I've seen Kill Bill twice now, with at least a third trip to the picture house planned. The last time I was this obsessed with a film was my inexplicable love for the hardcore Maximus in GLADIATOR.   If you find yourself alone, riding through green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled, for you are in Elysium, and are already dead.    I saw that flick so many times that I even found myself high on cocaine beating a woman with a mace.  Or was that Ralph Cifaretto in The Soprano's? I forget, and ultimately, is that really important?            "

638,Sagittarius,"        Diva in training  In true diva spirit, I took my oldest little diva to her very first Opera on Friday night.   It was 'Romeo et Juliette', performed in French by the  urlLink Florida Grand Opera .    This was an early birthday present for her, as she turns 11 next month.  I was a little concerned that, being only 10, she may get a little bored.   After all, this is a long one, at 3 hours and 15 minutes - with 2 intermissions.  She donned a new outfit - black skirt, white blouse with sparkly brooch; she did up her hair, put on a little lip gloss and selected an evening bag.  Topped off with my black wrap, she looked as if she'd always gone to the Opera.  She sat perched on the edge of her seat for many scenes, my opera glasses at the end of nose, peering alternately at the stage and the English translations.  I was so proud of her, and so glad that I was able to expose her to something that I think is just wonderful.  She agreed with me; it is something wonderful and she said she really liked it.   She's already selected at least two operas from next season that she would like to see.  Ah, my little diva is growing up.  Diva out.           "
639,Leo,"             I'm so obsessed with knitting, I decided I needed a spot where I could track my finished projects, muse about future projects, and generally go on about it all without being a drag on my regular journal, where I get to be boring about my life as a mama instead! I thought I'd just post pictures of my projects thus far, starting with my first scarf last November, which I made along with armwamers, with no pattern for a little family friend; however my son, Silas, is modeling them. They were made with some cheapy Lion Brand chenille, since I was deathly afraid of ruining good yarn, and I had yet to discover the many amazing yarn stores Seattle has to offer!        Next I made a couple facecloths for my sisters for Christmas:    I can't recall what order I made all of these, but I made them in December 03 and January 04. The kids' scarves have no pattern, nor does Vivienne's hat, but Silas' hat is 'Hot Head' from  Stitch 'n Bitch , as is my kerchief:          Next came my  urlLink Booga Bag , my first attempt at felting. I used Noro Kureyon #126:    Around the same time, I started a sweater for Silas. I only JUST finished it, so I'll post pictures as chronologically as I can manage. I also started the 'Little Black Top' from  Stitch 'n Bitch  for my sister, and a felted hat for my other sister. The hat is made with Cascade 220 (black) and a Dalegarn wool (purple), held together with a sparkly bit of something I bought off a cone at my LYS.    Next I decided to make a  urlLink little spring top  for Vivienne. I used Paton's Fresco, and loooved working with a ribbon yarn. It was a nice break from the Little Black Top.    Somewhere in there I made a spring shawl out of Plymouth Eros for our co-op preschool's annual auction, but I can't find any pictures. I did finally finish the 'Little Black (olive!) Top', and it fit my sister perfectly. It was my biggest success to that point. I had a huge sense of accomplishment.   Here is Susan showing it off:    I needed a major break from garments after that, but my addiction forced me to goof around with some spare yarns I had. So, yeah, a beer cozy:    That was pretty dorky, but it  did  inspire a little thing I consider to be pure genius:   (don't pretend you don't eat it out of the pint!)  Then  urlLink WEBS  had a huge sale and I got a steal on some closeout Cascade Lana D'Oro.  I started the 'Under the Hoodie', again from  Stitch 'n Bitch . I'm still working on it, currently working on the first sleeve, but here's a view of the back:    After frogging the sleeve once, I got sick of it and put it away for a few days. Well, of course, I couldn't NOT knit, so I seamed up Silas' sweater at long last:       And that, my friends, brings us up to today! Still plugging away at Under the Hoodie, having made numerous stupid mistakes on the sleeve and having had to frog it twice. Next up is Knitty's  urlLink Cleo  for my other sister, Helen. I'm also planning on a cardigan by Kristin Sperklund from the  urlLink Interweave  free subscriber patterns for Viv, but I have yet to buy yarn or anything. I need to start thinking holidays, too!  Okay. That's it for my first foray into blogging! C            "
640,Gemini,"           More of the stuff that I don't get.....  - Those big shiny balls on pedestals that people put in their yards.  What the heck are they for? Maybe a signal to the alien ships overhead?  -Beatles Fans  The Beatles music is the most boring ever. What prompts people to like them so much? I do like a few (very few) of their songs, but for the most part, I can't stand them. I'm told that their success is mostly due to the era they emerged. I can see that. But look at their solo careers. Paul was still boring, especially after Wings. John was the worst. The most interesting guy is Ringo. Check out the movie Caveman. It's great.  - Excessive body piercing.  The eyebrow piercing looks painful, but not too ugly. The nose piercing is just strange. Isn't that a booger catcher? The tongue one seems dangerous. If that thing comes loose and is swallowed, you could perforate the stomach. (Maybe it's more secure than it seems?) The belly piercing is very sexy. My personal favorite. (On a woman, that is.) The boobs, well that just looks uncomfortable. As for the genitals, I think those are the most dangerous. Certainly during a passionate moment, you don't want to get poked by a metal object. (I mean an unplanned poke, for you kinky folks.)    -Those little cars with the funny sounding mufflers.   There are a lot of these things roaming the streets. You can tell when you are sitting next to them at a stoplight. They seem to be bubbling, from the sound. When they accelerate, it's like the thing breaks wind to get started. Fart and start, I guess. They just sound like the muffler is bad. Along with the muffler, a lot of these cars have one of those home-made looking spoilers/wings (whatever) attached to the trunk. They look like someone made them in their basement and screwed it onto the car. Some are at least a foot higher than the roof. Weird.           "
641,Capricorn,"                 So I went Monday night to this advanced screening of Spiderman 2, I got passes through my super cool source who supplies me with the hookup. Little Side note that I find completely humorous, people go to these advance screenings for free, then they bring there 18 little drape munchers and go to the concession stand. They wind up spending anywhere from 50.00 to 75.00 dollars on food..... It sorta defeats the purpose of going for free if you're dishing out cheddar on some grub. So I get to the screening and sit down and these people in front of me are talking about how cool ' The Chronicles of Riddick ' was..... I hate to go on a diatribe about it, but I will..... ' The Chronicles of Riddick ' is quite possible one of the worst movies I have ever, EVER had the displeasure of seeing, and I'm only glad that it was free and I didn't have to pay money to see it. I think ' Air Bud 4 ' and Your Local Cable Access Hippie Poetry Show have more entertainment value to them than this movie does. It's the prequel to a movie that maybe 6 people saw and 1 person liked back in 1997 called ' Pitch Black ', it starred a then unknown, Vin Diesel , as a blind dude who helped these stranded space travelers get through this planet alive withought getting eaten by aliens. He could see at night and they couldn't so it helped them out. It was a decent movie, but it didn't deserve a sequel by anymeans, but because everyone loves the Melted Playdoh Faced Vin Diesel they decided to make a sequel. It starts off with some promise, then gets utterly ridiculous. They go to this planet where the temperature in the sun is 800 degrees and the temp. when it's dark is negative 300. We learn that when your Vin Diesel the laws of human physics don't apply to you. For instance Diesel spritzes himself with Tap Water and rides out into the sun on a rope to save the heroine who was stranded. He comes back still with some water on him and smoking..... If it's 800 degrees the only thing left of him would be his Huge Honker @ss nose. Then we learn, you can shield yourself from turning it bubbling human flesh by standing in the shade. In real world the temp in the shade is like, maybe a 5 degree difference, but in bizzaro world with Vin Diesel the temp. in the shade is 725 degrees different. Obviously it was a cool 75 degrees in the shade, while mere inches in the burning sun it was 800 degrees... WHATEVER!!!! Geez, should I go on??? I Must..... Remember when I said when it was night it got down to -300 degrees, well good, here's my point. Diesel and his cohorts were out gallavanting around in -300 degree temps with just tank tops and jeans on..... SWEATING...... That's right I said SWEATINGGGGGGGGGG.... Jeez, could it not hurt the director to maybe make a movie a smidgen realistic here????      Anyways back to my topic at hand..... In Spiderman 2, Peter Parker learns a harsh lesson that, no matter what you do right for the world ,there will always be detractors.... And for Parker and Bush alike - Big Media is the Main Destractors.... For Parker, when he foils a robbery attempt by Doc Ock the papers report he and Doc Ock were trying to rob the bank together. The papers refer to him as ' The Masked Menace '.... Sounds like another superhero I know of, who doesn't wear a mask, just a well ironed suit. George Bush is a modern day superhero. He put all his sh*t on the line to save the lives of millions of Iraqi's, what thanks does he get??? Big Media reporting that Iraq is another Vietnam ( Gee, I had a feeling that we lost Vietnam and I'm under the impression that we just re-wrote Iraq's government ourselves, for the better , wow I must be retarded or something ) He gets the Abu Ghraib Scandal, because didn't you know that George Bush while enjoying a late night snack called up a lowly ranked Prison guard and informed him how to torture iraqi's, I mean it's common knowledge I heard Al Gore and Teddy Kennedy have a copy of the phone conversations somewhere. And we get the Media reporting what a failure Fallujah has become, even though most soldiers and officers I've heard said we defeated most of the insurgents there.... You see there's a conspiracy here..... The Media wants you to think that George Bush is a Villian, an Evil Doer and a Crook because that's what they are, they want to divert the attention off themselves an onto someone else, and who betta??? The President of the United States, Why??? Because it's cool to hate on him... Why???? Because Hollywood and the Elite call him stupid... WHY????? Well..... ( Crickets Chirping ) Ummmmmmm He just is, because they heard it from someone else who said he had a funny accent....      George Bush is Peter Parker minus the Spiderman Outfit, He sticks up for what's right, defends the people who can't defend themselves, has a strong sense or morality and most importantly Sticks true to his beliefs no matter who or what doubts him... Personally with the way Media and Most of America treats him, I would have called a speech and told people ' Fine, you want me gone, I'm gone, I hate you anyways, I've busted my sack here for four years, defended you and kept you safe from those and others intent on destorying us like they tried on september 11th, you want another one??? Fine, you can have it, as for me, I'm gonna go to my super secret hideaway in Texas on a Ranch and relax, good luck with Long Face Jenkins as your new President, you're gonna need it, you ungrateful bastards! 'Then he can put his fingers in the side of his mouth and whistle and a galaint steed could come through the window of the white house and he hops on and puts on a cowboy hat and rides off. He doesn't need this junk anymore..... Personally I'd love to see George Bush go on the Celebrity Boxing circuit and take on people like Al Gore and Ted Kennedy and Hilary Clinton... I'd pay money to see that and for him to connect a few donkey punches to there sideburns.... Then score a fatality like in ' Mortal Kombat '.... Word.... I'm Out         "

644,Aquarius,"       Excerpt from the official GWB re-election site: 'Kerry Voted For Authorization To Use Force In Iraq. (H.J. Res. 114, CQ Vote #237: Passed 77-23: R 48-1; D 29-21; I 0-1, 10/11/02, Kerry Voted Yea.)  In First Dem Debate, Kerry Strongly Supported President’s Action In Iraq. KERRY: “George, I said at the time I would have preferred if we had given diplomacy a greater opportunity, but I think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein, and when the President made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him.” (ABC News, Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Columbia, SC, 5/4/03)  Kerry Later Claimed He Voted “To Threaten” Use Of Force In Iraq. “I voted to threaten the use of force to make Saddam Hussein comply with the resolutions of the United Nations.” (Sen. John Kerry, Remarks At Announcement Of Presidential Candidacy, Mount Pleasant, SC, 9/2/03)  Now, Kerry Says He Is Anti-War Candidate. CHRIS MATTHEWS: “Do you think you belong to that category of candidates who more or less are unhappy with this war, the way it’s been fought, along with General Clark, along with Howard Dean and not necessarily in companionship politically on the issue of the war with people like Lieberman, Edwards and Gephardt? Are you one of the anti-war candidates?” KERRY: “I am -- Yes, in the sense that I don’t believe the president took us to war as he should have, yes, absolutely.” (MSNBC’s “Hardball,” 1/6/04)'  Let me get this straight... > He votes for the war > He says he supports the President > Then he says he voted to 'threaten the use of force'  > Now he is anti-war (like he never voted for it.)  HUH?  Do you want a guy who doesn't know what HE thinks leading our country?          "

651,Capricorn,"           First of all I realy like to say Im sorry to Adam, you realy do have bad haircut but I had no rights to critisice it and well its your choice, ok?  Second, I went on Friday to get a haircut the thing was that I hadnt gone to do so since BCN and I did need one. Coz' it was that day all the places were busy exept for this one fancy place. So I went there and asked to, you know, get it short on the sides, a little in the back and some on the top, and get color as I had in Spain and thats it. Well so me and the, very beautiful, hairdresser had some rather 'emparesing' talk until I started feeling like she was giving me mullet so I said, you know I don't like the mullets. She replies that there were good and bad ones, and then we had a lifely conversation about bad haircuts in Iberia (Spain & Portugal) as we all sure have gotten to know. Well when she finished I thought I had a little pony tale but I wasnt that worried, just thought it was funny, she told me that on the back of my head it was most (hair) in the center (of the back of my head). Well no trouble, just something fancy...  ITS A MULLET, seriously I have been checking it out and its a fact!!! I have mullet. Ok, so I should just take some scissors and cut it myself, right? No, wrong coz' even though its horrable I have never in my life been so popular with the girls. I told you about my luck, on Friday and on Saturday my friend asked me to teach him how to hussle (like Im the master) and coz' he's the worst I went with him to help a little. We decided to start in this bar, where his friends go, but they weren't there, we just sat down and he had a little (actually alot) to drink and we chatted. Then this girl points me over (and she was cute, though her friend wasnt) I offcourse went. Well she told me that I was her 'prince of dreams' and thats how she would like her husband (her actual words there and then). I thought I was getting lucky so I asked her how old she was, what she did and so on. Ok Tim don't laugh too hard, she was a 27 year old dentist assistant with husband and two kids, thats where I put the line. Then she and her friend realy liked to armwrestle me!!! Whats up with that???  There are more stories to this night, but I havnt got time to writ'em.  Later, Úlli         "

658,Capricorn,"           This post goes to y'all but specially Tim. Ok there is this guy whos been a hit here and came to throw a concert in downtown Reykjavík, I did miss it specially coz I didnt have a clue who he was but I heard great things about him and so I got myself his album. Ok his name is Damien Rice and he's kind of like David Gray but yet different, he has great lyrics and is often just his wonderful Irish (smile Tim) voice and a guitar. He also has this female singer with him and some songs are very much produced (not in a negative way). So y'all should get this album coz you'll love it (ok maybe not Constance but even Seema might:D). I have a feeling though that you've all heard of this fella and specially my beloved Tim.

659,Scorpio,"       weird quirky things about me that make me weird and quirky: 1. I am seventeen years old and I am terrified of the dark... or being alone in the dark I guess...  or maybe NOT being alone in the dark. 2. When I have kids I am going to name them cool names like Artaxias or Atreyu, and Saloriana 3. I listen to dashboard confessional-esque emo music and it actually makes me cry. 4. Most of the time, the majority of the people have no idea what I am thinking or feeling.  I wear many masks {wahaahaahahaha} 5. I was incredibly excited the other day when I found out that private school kids can get into the lyric opera for free. 6. I go to a private school, and I like it... well, more than I would any other school. 7. I read a lot. mostly Margaret Atwood, because I'm obsessed, but I read other things too. 8. my friends/boyfriend...  enough said.  they convey enough weird and quirkinesses to me in the space of one day to complete an entire list. 9. my favorite soda is diet mountain dew. 10. I am a vegetarian... and really for no good reason now too.  Though I still really like cows.  they're cute.  P.S. I love you.    "
660,Capricorn,"           yesterday, i wasted about 6 hours of my day working on tech stuff at church.&nbsp; i was helping with a vbs followup service, and my responsibilities amounted to hitting play and stop on a dvd player.&nbsp; they could have had a kindergartner do it.&nbsp; then i helped 'tear down' aka winding up some cords.&nbsp; i did get to see some of my kids from camp though.&nbsp; one kid kept jumping off the stage onto me at the end, then he pretended that he hurt his ankle. little monster...i said if you keep doing that, your ankle is really going to hurt.&nbsp; all in good fun of course. i played 9 holes again today, and i feel fine, anklewise at least.&nbsp; i played so well, but i putted like...(trying to think of something that is bad at putting)...something bad at putting.&nbsp; have you ever had 4 3-putt bogeys in 9 holes? i did.&nbsp; another interesting fact:&nbsp;(follow closely, a bit confusing)&nbsp; i was as many over par on the holes where i hit the green in regulation as i was on the holes where i didnt hit the green in regulation (all you nongolfer types ignore that).&nbsp; anyway, i hit 6 out of 9 greens, had 20 putts (yes 20) and shot 42.&nbsp; very frustrating, but encouraging as far as ball striking was concerned. i think i am going to go see the bourne supremacy tonight, not sure when.&nbsp; i dont really like seeing non-comedy movies that much, but this looks pretty good.&nbsp; i will rate it tomorrow probably for you, since you respect my opinion so much. i got the u chicago 'uncommon' application (they are quite proud of this title) yesterday.&nbsp; i looked at the essays, and they are much better than the common app.&nbsp; not sure which one i am going to do.&nbsp; i can post them here, if you have any suggestions as far as which one i should do, feel free to drop a comment.&nbsp; here you go: i just looked at them again, they are too long to type, i will summarize. here we go again: 1) write an essay somehow inspired by super-huge mustard (like at sams club) 2) talk about how language sets people apart, covering peculiarities of your own personal language, how does it make you unique, etc. 3) 'any law that uplifts human personality in just, any law that degrades human personality is unjust' wrote mlk jr in 'letter from birm. jail'. give your thoughts on justice as it relates to 'human personality'. 4) i have already decided this is too confusing and not that interesting, so im not doing it.&nbsp; plus its about twice as long as any other essay, so i will not write it.&nbsp; apply to u chicago yourself if youre that desperate to see it 5) write your own essay question, like applicants did for # 1 and #2.  thats it.&nbsp; i am leaning towards 1 or 2.&nbsp; i think they can learn a lot more about an applicant this way than by saying 'how did you respond to an ethical dilemma' or 'who has had an impact on your life', so this application might actually be enjoyable. i downloaded a new song last night, called 'amazing' by george michael.&nbsp; its good, but nothing special.&nbsp; the preview only lets you hear the first 30 sec of the song, which were good, but the rest was kind of repetitive.&nbsp; i guess its a dance/pop mix, with very few vocals.&nbsp; its not a 'listen to on repeat' song for me though.

663,Scorpio,"       Today was another good day.  I drove to school and got my schedule changed... well that wasn't so good, but I'm not going to think about that right now, and then I had a liturgy planning commitee meeting and I got to see Katherine... I love her SO much.  And I talked to Samantha and Chantele both today... I had lots of stuff to tell them... and then I met with Fr. Don tonight, and talked about the youth group and a scholarship I got from the parish, and liturgies and other general topics.... THEN I had my first cantor practice for mass sunday.  Yes, I will be singing at noon mass on Sunday... I don't think you can even BEGIN to understand what a big step that is for me.  but I talked to the music director, and she wants us to get more youth music started and wants me to help.  So give me two weeks and I'll have St. John's whipped up into tip top shape for youth ministry!!!!!!!!!  Don't you just HATE having to do everything yourself? anyway, I'm excited about my general prospects for the future, I can't wait to see the new journalism room at school, and hopefully I'll get to see more of Sean once school starts, and I'm already over in that direction anyway, and I'm praying I won't be so stressed out at school this year  {I won't have to worry about the social issues I did last year} and NCYC is in November, and hopefully I'll be getting to sing lots of fun songs at church now....  la la la la la la la!!!!!!!!!

667,Cancer,"       well now. please excuse my absence, and also the fact that in the near future i may not be around so much. there was this thing, you see, and there was an issue, and so we all moved and we're not there any more. and i'm so tired of running around being responsible that i shan't say much more.  urlLink greg , less uprooted than myself, has written an account of the last couple of days. all i shall say is: no internet connection is losing, secretly stealing illegal mini-fridge for personal use is winning.  in other news i now have my mouse up and running, and it is lovely. i am also considering buying an inexpensive digital camera to supplement this here site with illustrations of exactly what the hell i'm talking about. you have been warned.   on monday night, as i lay awake before the onslaught of the day to come and during the onslaught of the rain which surely played its part, i got to thinking of a story from my past that i should like to share. the reason i thought of it was my (by now usual) insomnia, and all those fruitless efforts people make to try to sleep when their body (albeit ready to drop) is having none of it.  secondary school; before i gave up my childish dreams of doing something i wanted in life, i took a GCSE in drama. part of this course was taken by a large, somewhat sweaty man called george cockroft, who looked not a little like  urlLink john mccririck . which, thinking back, is a bit weird. i liked him a lot; he was an intelligent man who (for all i know on the subject) taught us well. but there is one lesson that still stays with me: in the drama studio (a big room that could be blacked out, essentially) one time he had the entire class of around twenty five lay flat on our backs, completely relaxed, whilst all the lights were turned out. and as we lasy there in the dark (the giggling subsided eventually) he began to talk to us, taking us through a systematic relaxation of our bodies. it was amazing; i think over half of us fell asleep, and the rest of us had never been so still. i still use the same technique today; and with discipline, it works.  at the end of the fifth year, when we had taken our exams and all was done, mr cockroft was leaving the school. and i remember one day (it may have been sports day), a beautifully sunny day, being outside on the field and having a brief talk with him. i imagine i said something like how much i'd enjoyed the drama course, and doing the plays, and the such. i imagine he said something like he was glad i'd enjoyed it, etc. and then i said something like 'so, i'm not sure when i'll see you again', and i remember him looking at me in a mysterious, almost mischievious way (this man was about fifty-five, i reckon), and saying 'oh, i think it'll be sooner than you think...'   i never saw him again.  n.

671,Virgo,"               I was reading a blog today by someone I know that goes in the same chat room that I do.  The entry was about a guy (naming no names but I'm fairly certain I know who it was about) who is also a chatroom regular.  Apparently this guy has been annoying this person by flashing his money around and is now apparently trying to 'buy' friends by taking a friend and her mum to a concert for free.  Ok I have a few things to say about this... 1.  This guy, to me seems like a nice bloke, he's always friendly, his jokes might be a little close to the bone occasionally, but he means no harm. 2.  From what I can tell he has had to work damned hard to get where he is today, earning what he is earning, so he is entitled to 'brag' a bit, not that I've noticed him shouting out 'I've got loads of money and you're all worthelss because you haven't', nor have I ever heard him claim he's better than anyone else because of it. 3.  As for trying to buy friends?  Well, what happened to good old fashioned, doing people a favour, or being nice to someone just for the hell of it?  We live in a very paranoid and distrustful society, and everyone seems to think that everyone else has the very worst intentions, and are only out for number one.  It's simply not true.  There are nice people out there, kind people, generous people, and I, for one, happen to believe that this guy is one of them.     I would like to think that this post might make a difference to peoples opinions, and perhaps give them a different perspective on certain things and certain individuals.  I doubt it will tho, people in general are pig headed and cynical...I should know, I'm exactly the same myself.     Incidentally, I am not sticking up for this guy because of any sense of loyalty, I count him as a mate, yes, but I believe he's been unfairly represented.

672,Pisces,"                 Have I mentioned how much I hate the real world? If I haven't, let me say it right now....I hate the real world. In this so called 'real world', I no longer have extended health coverage..I have ongoing debt..I wake up Monday to Friday wishing it was Saturday or Sunday..i'm forever irritable..i'm jealous of friends who haven't been 'lucky' enough to make it to the real world as yet..and i always feel like i've never had enough sleep...  Moms thought I was joking when I said it...but i was dead serious. I don't think I'm ready for the 'real world' and I don't know if i ever will be.   I think one of the thing that weighs the most on me right now is my lack of extended health coverage and the knowledge that in my field working basically as a self employed/independent consultant, I won't have health coverage until I purchase it myself. And because I'm just starting out and trying to work my way up...I can't afford to buy it for my self now. This realization hit me with a left hook a couple months back when I had to have a root canal...which hurt like hell...and then got the bill in the mail a couple weeks later...which hurt even more...  Then I got hit with the right hook a couple weeks ago when I sprained my foot (the how, when and where is a whole 'nother story) and again got slapped with the bill for the meds my doctor prescribed.    *sigh  If only I could fast forward a couple years and a few more zeros to my bank account.  If only...  *phew...there, I'm done venting...  There's a few other things that I need to get off my chest (namely my co-worker's comments the other day about the area that I live in)...but i'll save that for another day when it's raining.

673,Cancer,"       &nbsp;  but solitaire is a lonely man's game.  &nbsp; abstraction is a wonderful skill; it not only allows me to separate my higher functions and so see myself as 'i' (the notation becomes tricky) see other people, but also allows me to effectively ignore the world.  &nbsp; other theories and observations that i intend to share are mainly statistical in nature; i am forever intrigued at the difference between the individual case and the ensemble outlook. so much of the world is chaotic; and yet the word itself defines the world as completely and rigorously deterministic. but even this is statistical; the macroscopic newtonian world is merely an ensemble of the quantum level, where chaos is replaced by true uncertainty.  and yet things fall downwards; and they always will. bizarre.  &nbsp; i am fascinated by the notion of bringing order from disorder; matt ridley is keen to point out that humans (and living creatures&nbsp;in general) are merely localised anomalies of order in a world overrun by entropy, and the second law of thermodynamics.  i am reminded of the startling man lennart green, a card magician extraordinaire. this is a man that can have a deck of cards shuffled, and will then restore the entire order (suits and values) without you noticing. it is astounding; i saw him do it at a lecture once, and i was impressed. i learned the theory of how to do it; i was more impressed.  this brings me to my favourite current way of wasting time: spider solitaire. here we have an unending supply of disorder, waiting to be ordered. and when you win, you click 'yes' and there are yet more cards to sort. lucky i'm not the obsessive type, eh?  (bugger)  &nbsp; still, the idea of patterns and order is one that i feel is worth exploring. it is my contention that we understand things simply because we recognise the patterns involved. this generally comes from experience - learning to 'see' by interpreting repeating patterns of light as 'objects', for example - and so when faced with the unrecognisable we want to understand the logic of the pattern. if we are able to recognise familiar patterns in everything then we understand everything, but only&nbsp;in terms of what we already knew. if we strive to form and learn new patterns with every new experience then we understand everything, but with nothing in relation to anything else. the true skill then is to recognise both the familiar and the familiar in anything new:  what of this have i felt before? what of this have i never felt before?  &nbsp; i am rambling. i shall leave you with a list, and then be off to play solitaire.  staples in my stapler: 1 pictures of alex on my wall: 2 pieces my sunglasses are currently in: 4 pills left: 5 pictures of dido visible from where i am sat: 7 balloons on my desk: 12  n.

674,Virgo,"   I woke up this morning feeling really depressed...dunno why. last nite b4 going to bed, I prayed to God for me and him...hoping that everything wud be fine with us one day. I prayed for God to give me a sign. Then I dreamt that he was with me and we were about to catch a plane somewhere.  Me n my boyfriend, we've been togather for 3 years. I live here in Singapore and he lives in New York. We keep our relationship going by telephone and by me or him making the effort to fly up to see each other but that happens 2 or 3 times a year depending on whether he can make it here. All the time when we're apart, I feel so 'apart' from him. People ask, why don't u both get married. Well, I guess God is not allowing that to happen yet.  5 months ago I fell into a very deep depression. I was on anti-depressant and I cannot stop crying for days. I became better after afew weeks and I told myself that I never want to go thru this again but now I can feel it creeping back to me and I dunno how to prevent this. My boss came to me at work this morning and ask me why am I so quiet?! He mentioned that he's afraid to see me be so quiet. I didn't respond coz I know that if I did I would break down.  I find my life so unmeaninful. I'm doing things that people close to me wants me to do. If given the choice, I wud just resign from this hell hole of my company and take a break for 3 or 6mths go for a holiday....be with him (my boyfriend) for awhile and come back and do things I want to do.....why is it so difficult for me to make such a decision?

676,Gemini,"            RECOVERING LOSS LEADER TELEVISION   Seeing what I suspect is an aging  urlLink Dylan Lewis  on the trailer for  urlLink Mark Trevorrow's    urlLink The Way We Were   got me thinking about  urlLink Recovery , and once again my musings about youth television have brought me back to considering the role of the national broadcaster.   urlLink Recovery  was certainly a product of its time, which is why it wouldn't be the same now if it was to be resurrected or re-imagined in whatever form. It did come however at the tail end of a time when the ABC invested resources and energy in attracting an audience aged 16-24. As the budget cuts have constrained the broadcaster since, this audience has fallen unserviced and that point is acknowledged by the ABC itself, which is a market leader in children's and tween entertainment, scores reasonably with an audience in their 'middle years' and does particularly well with the Blue Rinse set. Recovery, along with Race around the World, Heartbreak High and to a lesser extent Attitude (which ultimately became a programme adults watched in the hope of gaining an 'insight' into their teenaged children) was the end of a line of youth directed programming at the ABC, the cessation of which was a product of a need to centralise resources and the resounding success of Triple J throughout the 1990s. It seems with the death of these programs ABC TV stopped attempting to compete in the loss leading youth market and instead resigned itself that that was the domain of ABC radio (JJJ).  Since, ABC TV produced programs which have attracted youth have been few and far between, contained in the success of more broadly targeted programs such as GNW, The Fat and The Glass House. The Fly TV development was an attempt to do once again on television, the sort of thing JJJ did on the radio. Of course, the fear of new television developments that is used to justify the raping of the ABC in this country saw money diverted elsewhere when the channel was not an immediate success. This decision was, in my personal view, one that disregards the history of youth television as a site for innovation in television and part of the government's more broader mismanagement of the development of digital television as a medium.  More recent programming such as Cath and Kim has drawn a youth audience to the broadcaster however, for the most part, the ABC has chosen to draw youth to the service through radio. Economically this decision makes some sense, and I'm not going to dispute it outright because, despite it's current misgivings, Triple J has been an important asset to youth culture generally. What concerns me however is that with the cessation of youth programming on the ABC a core place for innovation in television is demolished. Part of the hope for Fly was that it could become such a place, following in the steps of community radio and television in this sense as a ground where new talent could get a sample and a bit of experience in order to launch them into the mainstream. However more broadly, the decline of youth programming leaves televisoin without a key site for the loss-leader programs youth TV slots have typically provided. Double the Fist and Pizza are good examples - like them or loathe them, they are innovations in how to make low-budget television. Crank Yankers and Southpark similarly. Further evidence for this role is found in the experience of cable roll out across Europe, where sport drove cable uptake and music broadcasting (to a degree) the development of programming. Similarly, the innovations MTV brought to the American market (and eventually the world) were in part attributable to the fact they were operating under a profit model that did not require mainstream success.  It seems to me with the national youth broadcaster abandoning to some extent youth programming, the predominant place for innovation in Australian free-to-air television has become Network Ten. It follows a similar model to Fox in the US, a model who's roots ultimately lie in cable broadcasting, and by targeting an audience constructed to be receptive to new ideas, it becomes a key space for the innovation of Australian television. Big Brother, Australian Idol, The X-Files, Rove, GNW, and even Bread are televisual innovations. Granted none are essentially the product of Ten themselves, but Ten is the place for them to appear because it has its finger on the youth button. As much as CSI and 24 are innovative also, Ten has been the Network which has reaped the most financial rewards from innovations in programming. While this last point may seem to contradict my earlier arguments that youth television is principally loss-leader TV, Ten's financial success has come as much on the back of its low overheads and constricted running costs as it has its advertiser success.  The difficulty with this is that it leaves Australia as a site which is not so much open to innovation as it is to adopting the innovations of others. If we were to remove the necessity for the ABC to justify its funding in terms of ratings measurements and instead render its success in terms of meeting its charter obligations, perhaps innovative youth television could return to the ABC as a valuable servicing of the needs of an audience segment. Because as much as Ten sports youth television, the youth programming it carries is programming designed to answer to a psychographic conception of 'youth' rather than a demographic one. Of course, removing the necessity for the ABC to quantify its performance in terms understandable by the entire industry leaves us with the age old problem of determining how it is meeting its charter obligations. All of which I think is about either reconceptualising the funding model provided to the ABC (which will never happen) or reconceptualising the understanding of public broadcasting.  Of course, this discussion, which I suspect loses it's way a little towards the end, does nothing to consider the state of play over at  urlLink Channel [V]  which deserves some consideration as a successful site for youth television on Australian Tele.  The constitution of V is much like JJJ with pictures and herein lies some of its own success.  It also does not move to consider the greater developments in youth programming, namely the emergence of the one hour teen drama as the core genre that has embodied youth TV throughout the 1990s.  The Teen Drama is innovative television, often assuming a role as loss-leading - as much as Twin Peaks and The X-Files are televisual entities, so too Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek have brought innovations of form through an emphasis on style to the television screen.  Similarly, in considering loss-leader television throught the late 90s, one needs to look to HBO branded product such as Oz, The Sopranos and Sex and the City, as well as Push, Nevada and the adventure game exemplars such as Survivor and The Amazing Race.  Maybe more about them another time.         "
677,Gemini,"         In bed my real love has always been the sleep that rescued me by allowing me to dream   Luigi Pirandello (Italian Author)  --    Deep into that darkness peering,  Long I stood there, wondering fearing,  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal  ever dared to dream before.    Edgar Allan Poe  ------------   Perhaps the most true and false words ever spoken is in one simple sentence by an animated cricket, 'When your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme.' Such an idealistic thought could only be pulled off by a cricket that sings n talks, but what of us?   Sometimes the greatness I achieve only happens in my dreams, when I exist in a realm unlike my own. My deepest fears come charging to the forefront like stallions racing across the plains. My joys are enhanced 1000 times over and over again, like the breaking morning sun rays through the clouds that caress me with it's gentle warmth, then dazzles me with it's full brilliance. My woes, joys, hopes and desires intermingle with each other in a merry meshing of emotions that dare not express themselves in the waking state. Emotions wash over me, almost pleasantly drowning me, starting off as the lightest sprinkle of a summer's rain - warm breezes and cooling droplets..reflective, romantic. It escalates into a springtime shower...constant, fragrant, filling my senses with the hope and vitality of all things living regenerating themselves, new things to come. At it's climax...when the emotions are at its most potent and dangerous...are those raging storms - rain assaults me from all angles, filling me with an urgency, a warning of things to come. A slow rumble builds in the clouds of my mind, overshadowing all other things...awareness, sizzling excitement in it's headiest sense. Thunder roars out, starting at a slow, quiet purr and advancing with the deep intensity of a dark pouncing panther. Electrical static invades the air, crackling with life yet threatening the end of it. Lightening bolts snake across the dark skies, reaching with glaringly hot fingers, burning all in it's grasp, heightening my entire being to a state beyond words. I am challenged at that point with facing my hopes... what I most desire...in it's subconscious form. I'm enticed because it's forbidden, my sensuality manifests itself in every look, touch, sound and body. I wait for the quiet I know is coming, my opportunity...my chance to shout out in my dreaming state what I wouldn't in my waking. I take a deep breath, smelling the anticipation, the woody scents, the heady smells of crushed flora, I hear the thunder sounding very much like the waves beyond me..crashing on the rocks, the lightening illuminating in quick flashes my domain of possibilities before me, showing me everything within my grasp. Everything around me roaring and moving with an unspoken haste, daring me, urging me to be one with them. I shout out my deepest desires...spread my arms wide and give myself up to the elements, feel myself falling, drops bounce off me, wind goes through me....yet clouds lift me, lightening surrounds me, thunder within me.  I become a storm personified.   And then I awaken, leaving the storm to wreak havoc in my mind...lightening like spikes of uncertainty, thunder rolling through me as fear and rain drops drowning me in confusion.   To dream a dream that never lies,  To face the demons in their eyes  To defy the nature of the beast  Oh when will these thoughts cease.             "

687,Libra,"             Hello, I’m back again………. Friday was simply great; I did wear a saree after all. Since I live close to work (about a 5 min drive) my friends made me go home and change into a saree. Luckily my mum was at home so she draped the saree for me. The weekend was pretty busy. I met up with a few of my old office friends on Sunday after nearly 2 years. It was a huge effort on Ash’s part to get all of us together, but she did it nevertheless. It was really nice catching up on what has been going on and most surprising was, after we spoke for sometime, we realized most of our colleagues in office are either married or have a baby!!!!! We all met up at Barista and sat there for about 2 hours just catching up on what we had missed. Jerry is now a manager doing Strategic Planning (playing Sin) :o), Dhanya and Ash are trainers, Bryan is a Quality Analyst, Anne is back in college and Sujit and Conrad are doing very well for themselves. Gayathri who apparently didn’t turn up on Sunday, is now in charge of training. Three years back, all of us just out of college, looking for some place to start our careers. We got to know each other better and sooner than we realized we were good friends. All of us were in one team fortunately J and we continued to work together. Being our first job, every one was very enthusiastic, especially Ash, she would come to work even on her days off; our manager had to literally drive her back home. It was these friends who like a dose of caffeine, kept me awake during night shifts (2:30 am – 11:30 am).They were one of the reasons I looked forward to going to work (and the salary also :0) We used to go sometimes to a resort on team outing’s and we used to have a ball. Getting back to work next morning was a problem, but that’s beside the point. Little by little, people started leaving; Sujit was the first one and then Anne, then Connie and Brian and then me. Ash, Gayathri, Dhanya and Jerry still work in the same place. As months and years went by, we lost touch; everyone was so busy doing their own thing but the evening out on Sunday was an ice-breaker. It was like re-living the good times we had, how this first job has molded our future, our personality and not forgetting the precious friends we made. There is nothing better than the pleasant memories you carry with you as you move ahead in life.          "
688,Pisces,"             If you weren't at Rothko's on Friday night, you missed it, meng.  I caught my first (and rare, for a NYer) glimpse of what would have been the result if Stephen Patrick Morrissey had been born in Tijuana instead of Manchester.  This well-coifed man is Jose Maldonado, on loan from LA's Sweet and Tender Hooligans.  He's got the hair, he's got the specs, he's got the cuffed jeans, he's got the cardigan, the paisley paisley shirt (i think it was paisley), the malnourished yet amorphic physique - but more than anything else, he's got the voice and the on-stage disposition and relationship with the audience that truly captures his idol's mystery.  much unlike the fag (oh btw the douche - NO ONE LIKES YOU) that used to head up the Salford Lads (btw, guitarist John 'Johnny' Capp if you're reading this - how's RVC, pally?), Jose possesses class.  ash and i walked out on a Lads gig 4+ years ago at Don Hill's because the fagsinger was such a (coining G) nightmare.  back to the gig - kicking it off with the Queen is Dead, a few forgotten lyrics are quickly forgotten as he belts out the outro 'life is very long when your lonely', the set consisted of standard Moz and Smiths tunes including Shoplifters (sent out to Winona Ryder), Last of the Famous..., Girlfriend in a Coma, November Spawned a Monster and This Charming Man.  The Lads even assembled a great rendition of First of the Gang to Die off the new one.  All in all, SummerMan, my recently legalized S.O. and her teacher friend were all thoroughly impressed by the performance.  did i mention the four go's right in front of brandt and me that led us to make a pact to never smith smiths/moz tunes to each other?  i'll let him tell you about those guys.  i'll leave you with a post i left on the Sweet and Tender Hooligans yahoo group in true fan appreciation...  hey all -  brand new to the group and i joined just to say thanks to Jose for making the trip out here - your performance was jaw-on-the-floor amazing. the last time i caught the Lads i WALKED OUT because the old lead singer was so terrible - in talent and personality - but that's neither here nor there.  i'm sorry i didn't get a chance to catch up with you, but i expressed my appreciation to both ez and brian, the promoter. you kids in LA are damn lucky to have this guy as i'm sure you are aware!  hope to see you out east again sometime soon. cheers. matt.

689,Scorpio,"               We interrupt our regularly scheduled programme to bring you this groundbreaking news story!    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- This morning at 2.30 am, Miss Sarah Wong, a 22 year-old woman, was admitted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after having an allergic reaction to the anti-flatulence medicine, Mylanta.  The allergy symptom is described as a 'red rash covering the length of the patient's body, with small bumps appearing on her arms and a little on her face and neck.' The patient also suffered from puffy eyes, and a cough resulting from the constriction of her wind-pipes, making it hard for her to breathe.   According to the woman, described by night-shift nurses at the triage station as a 'walking asthmatic lobster with bumps', she had overate during dinner, and thus felt its residual effects - a little heartburn, and 'wind' in the stomach. She then decided to take Mylanta to help ease her discomfort.  Unfortunately, 10 minutes after ingesting the medicine, she felt flushed, and experienced an itching sensation all over her body, which gradually turned into a bumpy rash on her arms and neck. This was when she decided to call her boyfriend who drove her to a nearby hospital to receive treatment.  According to Miss Wong, 'My throat felt tight - probably from the allergy as well, which was why I thought it might be serious. I mean, I've never been allergic to anything in my life before, so I was quite worried.'  After a thorough examination by the doctor, it was pronounced that the Mylanta medicine was probably the cause of the reaction, and not, as suspected, the garlic prawns she had consumed for dinner earlier that night.  'I've had Mylanta once before, but didn't have a reaction then, though I was probably still allergic to it. Apparently the first time I took it, my body was just sensitised to it, which explains why I didn't get a rash then. But this time round, my body just reacted against it.'  After a dose of antehestamines (injected into her system via a drip - a painful first-time experience as well), and a few hours of sleep under observation, the symptoms receded and the patient was free to go home, with instructions to visit the allergy clinic the following week.  'I'm quite thankful that nothing more serious had happened - I hear you can actually die from allergic reactions! Praise God I'm fine now! I'll probably be more careful with what I consume from now on, and will make a habit of reading the labels in detail, checking the ingredients list. I mean what if I end up turning into a yellow banana with fairy wings the next time round? What happens then?'  30 July 2002 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We now return you to our regulary scheduled programme...           "

693,Aquarius,"       Yesterday I stopped by my nephew's soccer practice just to say hi and show him how much I love him.  He loves to show off, but he also gets frustrated with not being perfect when he kicks the ball.  He's 6.  He has a lot of perfectionist disappointments ahead of him.  While I was there a mother of another child came up to talk to my sister-in-law.  She was asking who was the mother of whom and I said I was just an aunt.  She stated how nice it was that I came out to see my nephew.    During school yesterday a teacher was telling me about a girl who was behaving badly (there is a long story about how bad this teacher is and how she creates the behavior problems in her classroom, but that is for another day).  The teacher was talking about the girl and how she lives with her aunt because her own mother is in jail.  The teacher was trying to point out to the girl that she needed to straighten up because he aunt was good to her even though money was tight in her house.  I hear these stories all the time, an aunt or a grandmother or even a great aunt taking custody kids in their families.  For some reason, yesterday, it hit me that this is wonderful and strange at the same time.  Another little boy told me a few weeks ago with a smile on his face that his daddy was out of jail.  This was a follow up to the statement 'my daddy in jail' that preceded a few weeks before.  I often don't know how to react to these statements and they are frequent.   Richmond is a troubled town.  The murder rate here evens out to about 10 murders a month.  That is unbelievable to me.  Crime is so prevalent that it isn't even a frequent topic of conversation.  The newscasters announce the death tolls almost nightly, but my friends and I don't worry because most murders are gang or drug related.  This makes us feel safer, but should it?  I've become desensitized to so much in this town.  I'm not shocked when teachers or kids tell me about people going into or getting out of jail or prison and I'm not surprised by bodies being found behind school buildings or churches being burned down.    I can't help but think that most of my feelings about family members taking on the responsibility of other family members is cultural.  Yesterday, though, I realized when that mother at the soccer field was so impressed that an aunt came out to a soccer practice that I'm so thankful that my nieces and nephew don't live with me.  I can't imagine taking custody of these kids because my brother was in jail (I would of course, but I can't imagine it).  I just can't even fathom it for my family and yet when a child tells me something like this I don't even flinch.  It seems so normal in the schools I teach in.  I realized yesterday that my desensitization is a bad thing.  It causes complacency and this will never help a child.  But, what can I say for Kindergartener whose role models are in jail that will stay with him and keep him off the streets when he grows up?           "
694,Virgo,"   Why can't I just break though your walls? And find out who you really are. I wish you would give me one chance, But you always said I wish too much. If only you would you take the time To drop those lies and let me see. You've got me twisted but I don't why. You're messing with my head So I can't even trust myself anymore. Please just tell me how you feel. Though we may be holding hands, I'm still left a distance from you heart. Sometimes I think you say those lies So much you started believing them too. What if I turned the tables on you? Would you be able to stay away? I wonder if you know that you’re my life, And without you I wither and die. When we talk I feel like I'm drowning. Before I can get a breath, The wave crashes down again. Only you can save me now. Even a few words will suffice Please just tell me how you feel.  "
695,Capricorn,"           Went to a BJJ seminar at the NYC Machado Dojo this past Saturday. The special guest instructor was Helio Soneca from the Gracie Barra in TN. What a powerhouse guy. Small, but waaay slippery, way strong and extremely talented. More than all that though, a great personality and enthusiasm for what he does shone through. Its contagious.  On the one day that I went, we trained without a gi and divided our time between muay thai kickboxing at first and then ground techniques. We rolled for two hours straight.  Unfortunately, I hurt my arm / shoulder from the repetition of one move where I got rolled again and again on my right shoulder. By the end of class my arm was aching from the top of my shoulder to my hand.  In a freak accident on Monday, I reaggravated it. But again, with ice and elevation the pain went away and I went to class on Tuesday. That was a mistake. Again by the end of class my arm was killing me worse than it did on Saturday. Throw in some numbness in my hands and there you have it. Owee.  So I get on the train. Its packed so I have to stand and I about pass out from the pain and or the naproxen I took right after class. Everything was going on me and I just sat down and I got my vision and hearing back. Of course I had had to throw a guys bag in his lap to get the seat -- SOB would not let me sit down. I was said  'Move your fucking bag or I am going to pass out right on you.' He must have thought I was crazy because he looked at me and looked away. That's when I tossed his bag. Screw him.  So Weds I go to the doctors, and of course there is no pain, again, and all of his moving me around produces no pain. I told him, it only hurts when it hurts, and even then, it does not hurt to touch my arm or shoulder. Pain just radiates down my arm and its weak.  Its really weird.  Suffice it to say no BJJ class for me today. Decided that discretion is definitely the better part of valor. Going tonight would have just meant another visit to the pain factory and I've been on that tour twice this week. That's enough for me. Hopefully the doc gets back to me soon with an OK for an MRI or some sort of diagnosis so I know how to treat this. Here's to it just going away and me being in class again on Tuesday.           "
696,Virgo,"       Ok. So nothing is really going on atm. Life's just kinda blah :P but at least it's going somewhere.  It's the last week of this semester....yay for final in math... and then, Kat's going to Summit next semi, so she's not going to be here...it'll be interesting. ack...so stressed over tests and not knowing where everything is going with people around me. Why do i feel so left out in the dark...?  So...there's this one guy on my mind...Brad... I really haven't known him very long, and I know very little about him. I want the chance to know more....but we haven't been talking like we used to...why? I hope something hasn't happened since the last time i saw him. I want the chacne to at least be his friend, or one of them, maybe be more if he gives me that chance...but how would I tell him how I feel. yeah, i could just come out and say it, but that's not who I am. i would keep everything inside, all emotions, unless they bursted out unwillingly. God!! how I wish I could tell people how I feel....like earlier today, Kat and Conley didn't want to do their english sim because they didn't know what to say about the topics they could talk about, and instead of just trying to give it a shot, they gave up and said they wouldn't do it. sure, you have 2 more years to do it, but what if you don't pass???? At least this time you know and your prepared for the next time you have to take it. oh well...their loss. then they were talking about their childern...that I couldn't handle, and I think, or I hope, they knew that. It just didn't seem right what they were saying...really really uncomfortable.  So other then that, life is pretty good. I can't seem to get along with my mom though...dunno why...and i'd rather be living with my dad, which is weird considering i hated him when my parents were together, but now that they are apart, it's switched...we'll see where it goes. I've been pulling away from my sister, and I feel really bad about that, but I don't know how to make it up to her because she hasn't given me the chance to. And Kat...with her going to Summit, I've felt like she's been putting more and more distance between us and our friendship........not that it hasn't happened before, but we've always been able to see eachother durring school hours... It's all just soo confusing...I don't know what to say...  my goal, for this, is to try to upgrade it when i get the chance, but that'll work when I've got soemthign to talk about :)         "
697,Aquarius,"       Numero dos is done.  Two weddings down, three to go.   The other day I received yet another wedding invitation.  As I perused the oh so familiar oversized envelope I wondered, “Who the hell is getting married now?”  I thought I was aware of all the weddings for this season.  Apparently now, but I was relieved to find out it is a second cousin.  I’m not close to her, so the pain of another wedding was lessened at bit.  It would actually be fine if I didn’t make it to this one.  But, it is in Florida in September.  Either that would be a great time to get a last minute tan or to see the wrath of a fabulous hurricane since it is the beginning of that season.  I don’t know if I’ll go.  It would really be a weekend of hanging out with the rents which, let’s face it, I do enough of in my own apartment when they decide to come visit, often.  I am; however, quite happy for this cousin as it is her second time of engagement though the first for actual invitations.  She’s in her late thirties and that alone gives me a bit of hope and room to breathe.  Tonight was a great wedding.  The drinks flowed and good food was served and we ate dinner overlooking a lake at sunset.  There were people I’ve never seen before and familiar faces from all the showers and pre-parties.  There were good friends and new friends and family.  And there was dancing and pictures and smiling and happiness and love, lots of love all around.   Starting at 3pm in a Catholic Church, I nestled in to back row pew and beckoned friends to follow suit.  Our row, full of teachers, was the official peanut gallery.  We could hear and eye everything from out backseats, the late comers, the whispers, the crying children, the brat child telling her mother to “shush,” we saw it all and yet WE kept quiet.     Not being Catholic, we were worried that this would be what my Dad likes to call and “aerobics class” service.  You know, up down, up down, kneel, up down, kneel, etc.  But, my good friend L. and C. decided on a Catholic light service since they too are Catholic light, if anything. The wedding was short and pretty with well-chosen songs and readings. The parish was beautiful.  I always love big, cathedral parishes; they almost make me want to be Catholic.      I go to so many weddings that I could probably recite the scriptures and the vows by heart, but this wedding did not bore me and when L. walked down the isle with tears in her eyes I kinda welled up myself.  I’m not a crier at weddings.  In fact, I thought for a long time that I had a stone heart because of my lack of crying at weddings.  Everyone else gets caught of in the emotions and you see women dabbing their eyes and bridesmaids pulling Kleenex wrapped about their bouquets.  I’ve never needed a Kleenex at a wedding and have always though “Yeah, it’s a wedding, what’s the fuss, why are you crying?”  But, today, for L., I understood a little more.  She’s almost 31 and the tears in her eyes were the symbols of her waiting so long for that man who loves and respects her and that she in turn loves and respects.  He’s not a perfect man, but he is one with whom she can share a life and so she cried for all that she is getting as she walked toward him.  And when I saw her crying, walking with her father, I thought of myself and if I ever find that man I’m sure then that my stone heart will certainly melt and tears will run down my face as I walk toward him too.    Cheers to L. and C., may you live happily ever after!         "
698,Pisces,"       So a lot has happened lately.  I'm driving, I helped some friend of mine, I have been doing more stuff socially, I'm going to Starbucks saturday and Becca's b-day party on friday.  It'll be fun.  Tomorrow is the Friends season and series finale.  It seems as though everything is coming to an end or just beginning.  It's a nice but upsetting feeling.  My friendship with Bella is growing.  We were so giggly this morning.  It was fun.  Just so much has happened.  There's not much time before we all leave for summer vaca.

702,Taurus,"           I'd posted this 'bulletin' (below) in response to one whore who just kept posting 'GO SEE F911' like 50 times a day.  Then, one of my friends wrote me the response (at the top), basically calling me an idiot.  Nice (but wrong).   I disagree--the movie is brilliant. Perhaps a bit too in your face with Moore's opinion--but any adult with half a brain can take the facts from the speculation--we do this every day when we watch the news.  Either way--your bulletin entry is silly--and I am telling everyone I know regardless of their party affiliation to go see the film. Until you do--you know nothing about it, or the brilliance of the documentary itself. I don't care if it doesn't change your mind about the President--but you can't make an educated decision either way until you have seen the film.  ----------------- Bulletin Message ----------------- From: Fat Kid Date: Jun 28, 2004 05:25 PM  via - Ed Koch (read bio here) speaks out against MM's newest mockumentary over at World Tribune.com.  Money quote:      The movie's diatribes, sometimes amusing and sometimes manifestly unfair, will not change any views. They will simply cheapen the national debate and reinforce the opinions on both sides.  The question it leaves, is, where do we go from here?  Like MM himself says, 'Do something', maybe it's time for us to simply rise above the shit-flinging and actually initiate civil dialogue beyond the scope of the 'Bush = Hitler', 'But, but, but....Halliburton!!' and 'No blood for oil' screeds...

705,Gemini,"        Coolness it's Friday night & Im home on my PC!!!  Rock on hardcore, Im such a villain!  Errrr... maybe not.  Well, anyways, Im comfy with my diet soda & the net to surf!  Nyah, nyah...  Ok, well, I was conversatin with one of the guys at HW, Kevin S. & it sounds like were definately on for Sunday night playing some Hero Clix.  He's been reading the rules & trying to figure it all out, should be a fun time.  Branden another guy from HW, might be interested in joining in at some point & trying the game out.  That would be fun too.  The more the merrier!  Sides, then I could teach them both at the same time & save my brain matter for more important things!  Like developing a cure for the common cold?!    At any rate, had a fun time playing Hero Clix with a few friends on Wed. night for a few hours.  Not only did we get to play but had some good conversation, sounds like we are all up for 'Return Of the King' & 'Matrix Revolutions' get together!  So thats something to look forward to.  There were 4 of us playing, we ended up playing teams, 2v2 - 200 pt teams... needless to say, I promptly lost both games I played in!  Hehhe... Sorry to my two team mates, Eric & Tom!  I suck...  But it was still cool to play & use new characters, I'll get the 'handle' on how to use the new DC guys, sooner than later I hope.    Rented 'Identity' & 'Man Apart' tonight & will try to get time to watch them both sometime on Saturday.  I've been neglecting watching any movies lately.  Just been too busy with either work or free time, Hero Clicking, which I like the most anyways!  I've been seeing some trailers on rentals & tv about a movie coming out called 'Underworld'  it looks like it might be a UBER Vampire, Werewolf, society, action movie!  Definately will have to find a friend or two to go see it!  Any takers out there?  Well, I'll let you know how I liked 'Identity' soon enough, from what I hear from everyone it should be great...  Im not a big Vin Diesel fan, so Im sure, it will be difficult for me to swallow, 'Man Apart' but, I'll try to do my very best.  I'm thinking about picking up some Batman comics & seeing where the Darkknight has been taken recently. I have a friend Tom, that is a crazy, Bat fan...  He was talking about a few issues that he has picked up.  Sounds really interesting.  I used to collect comics about 12-15 years ago...  Now, they are a different kind of art... not a lot of pages, more adds than ever.  So, I have to really consider it.  I look back at my old issues of titles like Daredevil, Avengers, & Uncanny X-Men & I look at the new versions & it's all 'greek' to me!  Geez, Im out of date, comics wise...  Maybe a fresh start with a new hero to collect like Batman, might be ok, seeing I'd be lost with a lot of the Marvel Universe anyways?    We'll talk again soon!  May The Force Be With You!  *Geeky Starwars reference*          "
706,Gemini,"           It amazes me how some Chinese people can believe in these fortune-tellers (算命師) so much. Like, they believe every single word.  This one fortune-teller told my best friend that if she has beef/steak, she'll have bad luck. So all her life she hasn't had any steak or beef or any cow-related food. (Well maybe once or twice.) That's just missing out on the nice food.  My other friend (who is a very good violinist,) heard from a fortune-teller that if she goes to Europe, not only will she have get a major illness, she'll also fail to get her degree, and end up broke. So now she's not going to even think about going to Europe to study music.  It pisses me off, sometimes, these fortune-tellers. I mean yeah, I know they have no other life skill and probably need this to make money to live... But what they're doing... it's like ruining other people's lives. My friend here could be a very good violinist. And now, if she stays in Taiwan all her life... I doubt she'll get anywhere.  Oh, and she changed her name, too. 'Cos the fortune-teller told her that her name would bring her bad luck. So she changed her name.  What the fuck??         "

709,Aquarius,"        ChILLIN’ Again…   Last night, Iya, Randy, Bobbers, Joe, Riann and I had dinner at Noodle World in Pasadena then treated ourselves to an evening of original music at McMurphy’s. I finally got to see ILL AGAIN perform and now I fully understand the hoopla that surrounds these guys. I’m no hip-hop connoisseur but I know what’s pleasing to the ear and their music really was. A 6-member band consisting of 2 guitarists (1 bassist), a drummer, a multi-faceted instrumentalist and 2 emcees, they filled the room with a solid following bobbin’ their heads to the beat of their sounds. Exceptional lyricists, their set was nothing short of unique and I do look forward to seeing them perform again.  What made the night even more happening was seeing our high school classmate, Jimelle. We haven’t seen her in 2 years and it was great seeing such a familiar face in the crowd. Catching up with old friends is always fun. I think the comedic moments of the evening were,. by and large, the dancing showcase of 3 women. One lady, who was dressed like a stewardess and was easily 40+ was by the stage, drink in hand, shakin’ her booty to the DJ. And then there were these two other gals who were dancing so furiously (I don’t know why, the music wasn’t that fast-paced) and they were literally bumping in to everyone around them. Randy and I were so ready to be like, “Will you please calm down? You’re all up in our space!” but we didn’t. We’re not squabbers.  Ok, time to get back to work. I keep forgetting I’m here. Which reminds me, did you guys read that article in blogspot about blogging at work? Ha ha ha…hilarious!          "

There was one episode of Matlock, however, that I recorded when I was 18, because my girlfriend at the time was in the background in a bikini!  Remember Michele Basye all you Lee Davis Alumni?  It was filmed at Va. Beach on a day that her family happened to be there.  Ahh memories... Anyway, feelin any better Angie?           "
712,Aquarius,"                 I really should be in bed already since I have an early morning. Tomorrow we are having a brunch for the women's ministry at church. I'm co-chairing the event, which so far has just meant showing up at 7:45 tomorrow morning and proof reading some stuff. I'm looking forward to getting to know some more ladies and hearing the message that Bernadette has prepared. She is one of the pastor's wives at church that I have gotten to know over the past few months. She's become kind of like an older sister which is cool. She's been very encouraging and we are enjoying being in Bible study together on Thursday mornings.  Ked is once again practicing his C and E chords. Only this time he tuned the guitar and it sounds so much better. I gave it a try tonight too. Now that was interesting. I think my fingers need to grow a couple inches. Ked said I'll have to clip my nails cuz they're getting in the way. Dog gone it! For once I actually have nails and now they're in the way. I really think we should take lessons rather than trying to learn on our own. As much as we love music, it would be really fun to learn together and play together.  So far the new car is working out great. It sure is a fun ride!                "

716,Aries,           welcome to the flaming new circle of irony!  thought i'd make it a little easier for everyone (all two of you) to read.  let me know what you think...         
717,Pisces,"             I'm saddened to read reports that 16 Volt have called it a day. Once upon a time, it seemed as though Eric and co. we're going to be the break out stars of that scene we were all once a part of. The Kidd, Mark Mohtashemi and I were big fans of this band, especially during their Skin/LetDownCrush era, which I think many feel was their peak. Those two records are classics and really had a unique sound and feel to it. During this period, Eric did an awesome remix for us of CROSS, which is on our second CD. Later, they assembled what I felt was going to be the 'dream team' with Krayge Tyler, Mike Peoples, and Servo, and while it kicked ass live, I felt Supercoolnothing was a bit of a let down (no pun intended. While I loved the songs, I felt it was too metal for my taste, though i find myself going back to it every now and then.  I don't know the circumstances of thier break up, but I know they had recorded new material via a demo deal with Capitol or some major, which I can only assume fell through. Also, Jason was telling me how he had been talking to Eric about an Acumen/16v double bill. I guess that's off, but it could have made for a hell of a swan song. Now I double regret our showing up too late to see them in LA last month.  I think 16V had a few more good albums in them. Perhaps later down the line they can bring it back. In the meantime, I hope this doesn't stop Eric Powell from continuing to make music. He's an extremely talented dude.  In the meantime, about a year or so ago, the aggression began demo'ing songs for what might have been their next CD. the material was quite good, but debate ensued as to weather or not these were aggression songs and they are currently in 'limbo'. A song or two from the 'Fernwood Terrace' sessions will probably end up on the Ass Cobra album, but one of those songs, titled 1956 will now be appearing on the Hypefactor record. I'm REALLY excited about this track, which is very Primal Scream, and appreciate Ash signing off on it. We'll work on it tomorrow night.  F         "
718,Leo,"   Part A  On the most fundamental level, we might say that structure is the commingling of space/time and organization.  I assume that it is a commingling in the sense that structure is space/time’s “description” of organization—or rather; it is organization’s manifestation of itself through space/time.  It is organization “through” space/time.      Now without wading though the mire of the “why” question yet, let me simply point out that humans are, if nothing else, organized beings.  Further, we are beings that express this organization in a variety of ways, most fundamentally through language, but I am getting ahead of myself.    Since humans are organized, and since they exist in space/time, all expression of this organization must (if our definitions are on mark) come in different forms of structure.    It seems best to speak of this endeavor of “expressing” in the terms of “building” or “constructing” so that when we say that humans are, at the very least, organized beings, we are also saying that humans are, at the very least, beings that build, beings that construct—building and constructing “structure.”  "

724,Leo,"                At this years Olympics in Athens, the us will be represented by Maurice Greene.  In a world where people outside the US think of us as loud, rude and generally obnoxious, we will be represented by someone who typifies all of these attributes.  Mo Greene is the self proclaimed 'Greatest of all time,' and rarely will he pass up the opportunity to let you know this fact.  While Greene has run a sub 100m dash 47 times in his career, his attitude and celebrations are equally as astonishing.  In the last Olympics he was a ring leader of one of the most embarrassing post race displays in which the Men's 4x100 meter relay team celebrated their gold medal by draping them selves in the American Flag and posing in front of photographers in a variety of poses usually reserve for a body building contest.  Then several months ago at a tune up meet for the Olympic trials Greene had a teammate spray his shoes with a fire extinguisher after he won the finals of the 100m dash.  The Olympics are based on the premise of world camaraderie through sports.  This does not include showing up all over your opponents with the actions of a testosterone enhanced peacock.  Olympic athletes are supposed to be ambassadors of this great country and are supposed to represent everything that is good about the United States.  Instead this year at the Olympics we will be represented by someone who has repeatedly represented every stereo type the world has for us.    One more note regarding the Olympics.  Many athletes from NBA, and the Williams sisters declined invitations to participate sitting security concerns as the reason.  I find this very self centered, there are literally hundreds to thousands of athletes in this country who would love to have the privilege of competing for there country.  I wonder if these people realize that the last terrorist attack that took place at the Olympics was in Atlanta, and was carried out by an American.  Grow up Serena, you are not that important that the terrorist are going to single you out, and didn't the last attack on a tennis player in a public place happen at a respected tennis tournament.  You have the opportunity to lead our nation to gold, and you back out and site security, give me a break, you probably want more time to design clothes or hob-nob with celebs.   That's just one guy's opinion!         "

735,Capricorn,"           (actually from 7.11.04) yes this is edition 2 of the weekly top 5. this is a big step towards consistency, as i have not yet forgotten about this. about 2 more of these and i would think that this will have been solidified as a definite 'department' of the blog. without much further ado, this weeks top 5 is: 'things i heard the most at camp'  5) 'hows it going, hoppy?' according to camp lore, hoppy is some guy from 100 years ago who was made fun of bc he had a curved spine and a short leg. to make a long story short, he was found dead in a cave, frozen to death while clutching a fawn to keep it warm. since i was kind of hopping around (w/ crutches) this nickname was bestowed upon me, and it spread quite quickly. it could be worse i guess.  4) 'hows the ankle?' pretty self-explanatory...as you hear this question more and more, you kind of get a default answer without many details once you realize that they dont want to know that badly.  3) 'i have to pee' to be expected w/ 3rd grade guys. we had a buddy system, which grew much more relaxed as the week progressed. my response went from 'get your buddy' to 'just go in the woods or something'. peeing in the woods is part of the camp experience, right?  2) 'my (insert authority figure, usually male, such as dad/grandpa) can (insert impressive feat that is usually doubled in exaggeration)' as covered yesterday, these kids still idolize their parents/whoever else. some of these stories were obviously fabricated, some were probably true. another fun thing that came up a lot about parents was personal information such as diets/weight/age of parents. these parents might want to rethink telling the kids this stuff...  1) 'what did you do to your ankle?/how did you manage THAT?' imagine telling about 100 people (literally) that your injury was from something as dumb as jumping off of a slide from 1 foot off the ground. i would have liked my injury to have been from something a bit more respectable, maybe i dived into the pool to save a kid from drowning or something like that. humility is a good thing...  there you have it. i am off to watch some us olympic trials for track & field now, then a 2-hour special on trading spaces!

741,Capricorn,"                 Gago, Tarantado, Sira Ulo  By: Mariel G. Calalo  She went half way across the world in the hope of finding 'the one' only to realize that it was in front of her the whole time. She missed all the signs. She found him... only to lose him again.  She believed in fate, in destiny, in love at first sight. She believed that when she finally finds 'the one' She'd  know right away because her heart will just tell her so. Probably, it would be easier to say 'yes.' Well, her heart's not just stubborn, it's actually dyslexic. 'Cold' is an understatement.  Peel her to the core and you would realize that 'non-committal' is the more appropriate word to describe her. The first sign of a possible romantic entanglement, and you'd see her running on the opposite direction. Siguro hindi niya lang gusto ng komplikadong buhay. Every attempted I Love You was responded to by 'Gago. Tarantado. Sira ulo.' She has spent her days waiting for love but afraid of being close where she needs to be the most. She was waiting for lightning, listening for thunder just to finally realize she has  found the one.  Somewhere, thousands of miles from the life she has grown accustomed to live, she did found someone. He was simply perfect. He was warm, friendly, funny, patient, driven yet able to have fun. He wears eyeglasses but even with those spectacles she  just couldn't help but marvel at his deep-set eyes and long, curly eyelashes. He made her laugh  and the things she would normally find annoying in a guy, she found them cute in him. He was a perfect gentleman. He opened doors for her, carried her stuff, he even volunteers to get her water. He was at her beck and call. He was handsome, too handsome it felt like being punched everytime he smiles. Life could not get any better than this; he filled her winter mornings with so much warmth it felt like summer. There were times when she would just gaze, stare, almost in awe, watching him glide among the crowd and convince herself that life could not get any better than this.  She has never met anyone as agreeable as this and there were times when she  wished that she didn't have to go back to her old life. However, at some point, reality had to walk in and she had to say goodbye to this perfect stranger.   Her life has been a long, continuous process of hellos and goodbyes. He accompanied her to the airport and they said their goodbyes. She offered a handshake, instead he asked her if he could hug her goodbye. She was floored. On an ordinary day, she would have said 'Bakit??? Gago, tarantado, sira ulo!' He wouldn't understand it anyway so she thought 'well, why not?' She took a step forward and he hugged her goodbye. She hugged him back and it was the longest 15 seconds of her life. It was like a near-death experience, seeing her entire life flash before her. At some point in the longest 15 seconds of her life, she somehow wished she was hugging someone else. She wished she was hugging that 'gagong tarantadong sira-ulong' she was scared to be with, the one she has always been afraid to hug because she feared she might not let him go if she did. If the only consideration in finding 'the one' is her state of bliss when she is with that one person, then the choice would have been easy to make. Resistance is futile. She knew that it had to be that 'gagong tarantadong sira-ulo.' He had to be 'the one.'  She spent four hours in the airport trying to understand what just happened to her. First, that was unpredictable of her. Second, it was just so out-of-character for her to just hug a guy she barely knew. She has known someone for five years and she had always made sure he never violates the '1-foot away personal space' rule. Third, it was just so out-of-character for her to miss someone who's not exactly synonymous to the word 'good boy', the kind you'd want to bring home to your parents. She has always believed she was too wise for situations like this.  It was confusing. She wanted to get the first flight home because she needed to find out what could be the cause of this anxiety and she's damn sure she's not gonna find it in New York.  It was a long flight going back home. It has given her enough time to contemplate. No matter how much her head argues with her heart, the latter always found a way to win. She knew she had to come home to the uncertainty. She practiced clever lines to say. She wanted to say 'I'm sorry for screwin' up. I think leaving you behind had to be a sin.' Or 'Starbucks in every corner of New York City will never be the same without you.' Or 'I've just met this incredibly perfect person who's just so handsome it feels like a punch in the face. But you know what? I had to come home to your smile because it feels like soft breeze across my face.' She knew life was never gonna be the same without 'gago, tarantado, sira ulo.' At the back of her mind, she knew, 'gago, tarantado, sira ulo' is not exactly like that. There must be something, so much more, that she refused to see the last time she looked at him. She didn't want to be a fool wondering what might have been. Maybe, just maybe, this time she'll say 'yes.'   For the first time, she allowed her heart to see. She had seen him too many times before but never really SAW him. As soon as she got the chance, she asked how has he been getting along with life, waiting and hoping for him to tell her how much he missed her. Apparently, he was getting along without her very well. And missing her never crossed his mind, not for one moment. And so, in the moment of truth in every lie, she decided to stay silent. She decided not to say any of the lines she practiced. She chose to leave them unsaid. What is the point of saying the truth if nothing could be changed? What is the point of saying the truth if the truth would only cause pain? There are certain things in this world that are better left unsaid, things left undone, thoughts left somewhere in the back of your mind, never to be thought of again.  She wanted to believe that life is better off uncomplicated.  The problem with this story is that it ends right where it should begin. Perhaps, someday when love outweighs  fears, when certainty is far stronger than the shadows of doubt, when faith and hope rings true, this story will have the ending it deserves. Until then, both characters continue being lost in the limbo waiting for lightning, listening for thunder, praying for love to come their way.         "
742,Aquarius,"       Richmond's annual chili cook-off held many feasts for my eyes:  1) William Hung.  I know, you're jealous.  He was one act among many at the festivities and his one song performance of 'She Bangs' was almost worth the $20 admission fee.  2) People wearing clothes that should have been retired years ago (or never purchased)- a) Belly shirts- these should only be worn by people who do not actually have bellies and then only when they want other women to hate them. b) Clothing that is too tight- there was a woman who looked normal in everyway except that her tan linen pants were a bit snug above her thighs, and by snug I mean she had a perma-wedgie. c) Stripper shoes- The shoes which I am referring to had a 3 inch clear plastic heel, silver souls, and clear plastic straps.  I know, you're jealous again.  Note to self- don't go to the chili cook-off as can't handle the dress requirements.  3) People running after beer- the beer trucks ran out of beer about an hour before the cook-off ended.  We were waiting in line and when they would announce that the beer was gone people would scatter quickly to another truck, and so on, and so on.  Note to self- don't go to an event where grown people run after silly things, unless there is a sale on at Saks.  4) A woman's bare ass- as I walked to my car I saw that the passenger door of the car beside me was open, blocking my door.  There was no one around and as I got closer and closer I looked for someone to tell that I needed to close the door.  Then, as I approached my car I saw that there was in fact someone behind the door, a woman's bare ass peeing.  Um, OK, um, um, look in the other direction, um, wait, um, don't look, hope that friend tells her I am here, um, um.  When she is done and is pulling up her pants over her bare ass and says 'I'm sorry, I just really had to pee,' say 'It's OK, do what you gotta do' and quickly get in your car and pull away.  Note to self- never, never have to pee that bad.            "
743,Virgo,"       I have now seen the play known as 500 Clown Macbeth a total of seven times. Which is more than I have seen my favorite movie  urlLink Croupier . Basically in 500 Clown Macbeth, three clowns fail at everything they try. Through an amazing series of stunts, tricks, pyrotechnics, humor, improvisation and gymnastics the clowns manage to embody every human emotion. In fact, the only thing they do not fail at is to make the audience engaged.   Point: Shank seeks  urlLink admonishment  from an audience member after shooting his fellow clown, Bruce. He managed to get it from an elder man of eighty plus years in a beautiful white suit with grey pin stripes. The man even had the broad brimmed hat to match.  'Stupid Shank!' yelled the old man. I was just taken with the comfort of that moment.  Later, the third clown Kevin, played with some fake blood the three have stumbled upon. The first two clowns acted as if they shot each other and spat out the blood. The audience cheers. Kevin, a female clown, splashed blood under her dress and acts out  urlLink menstruation . The audience boos. Kevin then questioned the audience's enjoyment in gun violence, but disgust in a natural life cycle. The audience cheered her point.  It is just such a great play. I went with Miss Charlene and we had Thai afterwards at a place that had over a thousand Pez© dispensers on the bathroom walls. Kudos to Cozy's.  I guess the moral today, if there is to be one, is about using the absurd to point out the obvious. Why are we such creatures of ignorance that we fail to laugh at our own absurdity?  urlLink Much is to be learned from clowns who learn everything from us .     "

749,Pisces,"             For the second post in a row the MOGpac heads south of the border. The circumstances: FJ and I booked another 10 a.m. session at BIrdcage on Wednesday to continue work on vocals. The day was unique, however, in that we decided to tackle a vocal track for the song 'Our Faith.' Which, as it happens, is sung entirely in Spanish... a language that neither FJ nor I speak.  The backstory in 100 words or less: I demoed in the song in the fall of last year, then FJ came and re-arranged it. Jamie Duffy of Acumen Nation/DJ? Acucrack/Chemlab stopped in the studio and added guitars, followed by another few months of writing/arranging. Then, in March, we mailed the computer files for the song to Leo Canneto (Virus 23/AM Pacific), who recorded more guitars and a Spanish lead vocal while FJ visited him in Los Angeles. A Gustavo Cerati homage, basically, and a damn good one at that.  While FJ knew he wanted the song to be a duet of sorts, he came to the studio with no real arrangement game plan yesterday. One idea floated earlier was to mix Leo's Spanish vocal with FJ singing in English. But after listening to the track on loop for about an hour, we realized that altering or eliminating any significant part of Leo's vocal to accomodate FJ was, well, pretty fucking stupid. It is a brilliant vocal, so why fuck with it? But in keeping with the duet plan, FJ saddled himself with the challenge of learning Leo's vocal in Spanish and doubling it. And he rose to the occasion, I must say, as he hammered the song out word-for-word over the course of a couple hours. One of his strongest deliveries yet.  We also found the time to track a rough vocal for a chorus of 'Descriptive' yesterday, marking the first time we have ever recorded a vocal so early in a song's gestation. There is not much to write yet because the song is far from complete, but I think the final version of this particular vocal will be one of the finest performances FJ ever commits to tape. I predict that will be a difficult session, however, as the tune requires a delicate croon unlike most anything recorded by either hypefactor or The Aggression. More on how this plays out once we have the verse figured out...  Aside from the vocals, I have been putting in a lot of hours at the studio editing drums and trying to keep the album on schedule. 'The Morning After The Life Before' is the priority song right now; we recorded a slew of guitar and bass overdubs in late April and early May, and we want to wrap up the vocals within a week. Once the live drums are mixed with some programmed rhythms (courtesy of Ash's wonderful TR-909 and, perhaps, Robin Emmet), this song will be a monster worthy of comparison to recorded music's best album openers. Modesty? Not in this case.  Also near the front of the editing line is 'One.nine.five.six,' the aborted song we recovered from The Aggression's final demo sessions. A vocal session for that tune will have to wait, however, as FJ and I agreed earlier in the week that Charles should be invited to re-write and re-track the bass line. While FJ and I have been on the same page from day one about what the song  should  be ( Exterminator  and  Evil Heat -era Primal Scream, mostly), we both seemed to have reservations about our instrumental execution. In an effort to breathe some new life into our thinking, we gave Charles a wide berth in terms of what he can write and record, and I hope his ideas will allow us to revisit the guitar and vocal melodies later this month. If his performance on 'Descriptive' is any indication, Charles' playing will properly anchor the song, and that is exactly what it needs.  And now for a non-sequitor: While the Birdcage studio (aka my apartment) has three rooms, most of the recording takes place in a room tucked in the northeast corner (as it is farthest away from my fifth-floor neighbors and, therefore, less noisy.) This is also the only room with a clear view of neighboring apartments, as it abuts directly on two other buildings. Lately, the view from my mixing desk has been getting more and more Cinemax. About two months ago, my distant neighbors decided to eat dinner in their lingerie. Last week, the people whose kitchen window looks out on the studio had some sort of professional photo shoot in their space, replete with many shirtless men. And last night, in a moment that would have thrilled Ash, I sat editing drums while a girl in the same kitchen walked around for ten minutes... topless. Now who said studio work was boring?         "
750,Libra,"       How cute.&nbsp; One of my former students, Fam Seng, IM'd me.&nbsp; She just got her first cell phone.&nbsp; (I was her mentor/tutor when she was 13.&nbsp; She'll be starting her senior year of high school in the fall.)&nbsp; I told her I'm moving back to the East Bay next week and she's excited like, 'Can we have sleepovers again?'&nbsp; (I used to have all my girls over for sleepovers--that's probably the only reason they liked me.)&nbsp; She's got her driver's permit and she claims she's taller than me now.  Makes me feel so old!  Last night I gave Yuki a ride home after the Hyphen general meeting.&nbsp; After I dropped her off she called me, telling me she left her phone in her car.&nbsp; To be sure, I called it and I heard the chime/ring, but it took me forever to figure out where in my car it was because it fell inbetween the passenger seat and the middle console.&nbsp; I met&nbsp;Yuki downtown&nbsp;and dropped her phone off earlier this afternoon.  After last night's meeting I had a quick talk with Donna, to touch base on what her next project/s will be and what kinds of things she'd like to work on.&nbsp; Donna was just recently voted onto staff, after being a 'fellow' (intern) for three/four months.&nbsp; She originally wanted to be on the Edit Team, but her background is in marketing, so she had a better 'fit' with Business Team.&nbsp; She was officially voted on as my 'assistant' (at least as far as marketing/publicity goes).&nbsp; It's strange--I've never had to manage anyone (not like this, at least).&nbsp; I tend to be a Control Freak who, as a result of her control-neuroses, spreads herself too thin.&nbsp; What I need to do, is give Donna the benefit of the doubt that she can complete whatever tasks I assign to her, and do them on deadline.&nbsp; I wear two hats for Hyphen, so when I'm busy with event crap, I need an assistant to pick up the slack with administrative duties for marketing/publicity projects.&nbsp; I should take Donna out for dinner/drinks every so often, so she doesn't feel like I'm just a Micro-Managing Taskmaster...  Blah.  I wrote Mel two checks last night--one to pay out the deposit to her outgoing roommate Barbara, and one for August rent made out to our landlord.&nbsp; It  hurt  me to part with that money; I kissed my two checks before I handed them to Mel.&nbsp; Like, 'Bye-bye money!'&nbsp; But a week from now I am out of Pacifica!&nbsp; I can't wait!&nbsp;  Tomorrow night&nbsp;a bunch of us will be hanging out with C.Fan (Chris Fan).&nbsp; Chris used to be with Hyphen, then&nbsp;he left for NYC for grad school.&nbsp; I hope&nbsp;when I drink tomorrow, I don't feel all funky like I did at Milk Wednesday.&nbsp;  Okay, have a good weekend.&nbsp;     "
751,Leo,"             1. Do you feel this would be something you would like to use? Yes, because with this technology, I could buy anything easily and I would not have to look for things. They will advertised the things you want for you.   2. Do you think society is ready for technology like this?  I think that the society is not ready for this because most people will not take it seriously and they don't know much about this technology.   3. What would be the benefits of this technology?  People could shop easily. They would not have to spend hours to look forn the things they want to buy. The chip could detect the things easily.   4. What could become problems with this technology?  Terrorist could kill a person with an important chip implanted in his body and used his chip inside his body to gain access to secret files.   5. What other thoughts or opinions do you have regarding this technology.  I think that this technology will be fine for some people. But others will want to stay the same by not accepting this technology.       1. How does the increasing use of cameras affect privacy?  It could affect us because people will be watching us when we are eating, sleeping, talking, and walking on the streets.   2. Where do you think it is fair to have cameras installed? Not fair?  It is fair to have cameras installed on the streets, buildings, parking areas, stores, malls, and crowded places. I think it is not fair to install cameras in toilets, houses, and schools.   3. What is your opinion on this subject?  I think that this subject tells a lot about the technology around us. It also tells us how it could affect our lives.    4. If you feel that this is an invasion of privacy, how do you feel governments should help increase protection from the inclining terrorist threats?  I thing that the governments should put more cameras on airports and streets. The more cameras the government install, the saver it will be. But we will get less privacy.            "

754,Leo,"       Lusting is way too hard not to do. I don't think masturbation can help someone stop lusting in some situations.  Say, you have a girlfriend that you spend a lot of time with.  Will it help to just masturbate EVERY TIME before you see her so that you won't have impure thoughts about her? That's a heck of a lot of work to do, rather than just trying to control your urges.  We have souls here, it seems like a reasonable idea. It seems very possible to contain yourself if you genuinely want to.  First, you have to believe that masturbation is a sexual sin and then every time you have a desire to lust, remind yourself that it is wrong.    I never said that I believe people shouldn't masturbate, it's just fun to be on the other side of the spectrum for once... Christians have way harder problems to cope with than masturbation.    And to Robb, I'll be sure to remind you of what you should be worried about.  If, in fact, I am that talented or intellectual.          "

Just about everyone loves him, because he's just that kind of a man.  I was filling in the time while his lunch appointment rushed to get to the hotel to meet with him.  In that 20 minutes or so, we talked about life in Miami Beach, careers, love and lovers, friends and the joy of being who we are.  I can't impart to you what it meant for me to sit quietly at a table. While I munching multi-grain bread slathered with sweet butter, the sun was shining in through the windows, people were moving through the lobby and past the pool, diners were chatting and chewing nearby.  The few minutes we spent talking were more time than I've ever really had to get to know this amazing person.  He loves living his life, he loves his job - Tourism Director for Miami Beach (and so much more), his views on dating, on working a room, on living.  And when you talk, he really listens.

I still have to come to work but I have no class so you will get more updates but they won't say anything interesting I bet.       "

782,Capricorn,             Happy Holidays to everyone viewing My BLOG!           
783,Pisces,"       It's ten thirty and I'm avoiding all the things I should do, because suddenly there are so many things that need to be done.  The internet seems to play to this tendency in me.  I suspect its because it simmers with incipient connection (incipient is a favorite word of mine).  In moments where I'm feeling overwhelmed, I find myself craving some kind of quick satisfaction.  The two that are most appealing to me (for better or worse) is a *real* connection with some person / idea / story OR food.  I'm trying not to go with the frig tonight, so I'll blog into the great wide open.   Everythings going *CRUNCH* right now because I'm heading to Kalida tomorrow.  Erin -- my friend and former student -- 's dad died.  I don't know the details yet.  I'm just feeling the ugly thud in my stomach of death.  I've been talking about death to the kids today.  Its inevitability.  Its importance.  Its finality.  The brokenness left in its trail.  So I'm buzzing across the state for calling hours -- which is the LEAST I can and should do -- but as I'm trying to put all the pieces together I'm struck by this idea -- that COMMUNITY costs something.   This is not a surprise, but it seems profound to me right now.  I ran into this great blog --  urlLink Ordinary Community  --yesterday and I was longing for the things they were articulating (even though I'd say I *have* some degree of them -- as much as 'community' is a thing that you can have), but then later I was thinking Yeahbut -- community as  urlLink GOD TERM  is sooo not enough (inasmuch as it is a rhetorical move).  Because Community Costs.  So that's my backburner of the day today.    "
784,Capricorn,"           another day, another 85 on the links.  this one i was not happy with.  i was +2 thru 7 holes then i fell apart.  i only hit 4 greens, so i guess it could have been much worse.  the heat got to me again, i couldnt make 36 holes.  ill probably go hit at the driving range this afternoon or something.  i just remembered, tomorrow my mom is making me take an all-day 'defensive driving' class.  grr.  i dont need help driving, since i havent had any accidents or tickets in over a year.  i am viewing tomorrow as a wasted day. maybe i will end up enjoying it (smirks knowingly).         "
785,Pisces,"        urlLink my brother raises a question on his blog  which has buzzed around in my head for more than 24 hours, so I thought I’d simmer on it for awhile.   He mentions our friend Chad who had one of his most formative experiences in a trip to Australia…he (cryptically) mentions a week in October of 1994 as being formative for him, and then he invites us in:   What week has been most formative in your life?   I commented that I haven’t had any such weeks – but I have had seasons of life which I identify as transformative and revelatory, but ultimately, even in retrospect, they lack a cumulative property.    Instead such months / cycles / seasons / (and frequently) semesters – seem to reform previous insights and directions into wholly other experiences. Directions I had not expected.  I don’t want to say that these bursts of discovery and meaning have rendered my life more discontinuous than continuous, but on the other hand…were you to try to turn my life journey into a map, it’d be hard to see a unified direction…  And for me that’s the why the question keeps BUZZING.  When you use a metaphor like “formative” (the original title for this post) – it automatically renders past experiences meaningful in a sort of entelechial way.    In the best scenario – such experiences also render the  present  eminently more meaningful, congruent and whole.   This is not something just my brother does.  I do it.  You do it.  We do it. I’m convinced that the human capacity to tell-stories-in-order-to-survive…is a quite basic phenomenon – maybe even the MOST basic (sociological) human phenomenon.  I guess its those moments when you find yourself WITHOUT A STORY – that you feel most precarious.  I’m not feeling liminoid right now.  David’s question actually provoked me to start thinking about a whole set of stories that render my current life meaningful – but it also provoked me to think about the insufficiencies and partiality of those stories.   Hope today is formative - transformative - revelatory and/or (since it is the Christian Sabbath) full of …  peace~       "
786,Gemini,            This is  THE  most hilarious posting still in the congress ministry. I have never seen a man like  urlLink LALOO  and I don't think I will ever see such a man in my life time.He is the sort of man who told Computers are not necessary for Bihar.Nou what will he say?. Just my Imagination(who knous- it may turn out to be true) 1.Railways doesn't need Electric Engines-they can run with bullock. 2.Reservation of seats based on caste- No Upper Berth(No upper Caste) 3.All Trains to pass through Bihar- even ahmedabad to Mumbai trains. 4.All trains to have a separate coach for cattle n fodder 5.Railway staff can do reservation by paper and pen- computers to be abolished. 6.India to be made a Bihar in 3 months. 7.Indian Prime Minister will be asked to travel in Trains to all the countries in the world as Ingenious Technology will be used. 8.Instead of tickets the passengers can give a Kg of fodder to feed the cattle in his house. 9. Remaining will be issued in the next order......           
787,Gemini,"       This from MyWay:   NEWBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - John Kerry said Friday he would put Osama bin Laden on trial in U.S. courts rather than an international tribunal to ensure the 'fastest, surest route' to a murder conviction if the terrorist mastermind is captured while he is president.     (For the rest of the article, click  urlLink here .)    The 'fastest, surest route' to a conviction?  In our courts?  Give me a break.  How many death row convicts have been on death row for years due to appeal after appeal after appeal?  Who would defend Osama?  Johnny Cochran? Al Dershowitz?  This demostrates that the Democrats still, after the unprecedented attact on our a country, consider global terrorism a law enforcement issue.            "

789,Scorpio,"              I'm still here  In case everyone's wondering, I'm fine and no, I haven't flopped out of my goldfish bowl. Speaking of which, there's a new ad on TV right now featureing fishes swimming around a baby in his cot - for some sorta baby monitor by Fisher and Paykel I think. Not sure - if anyone has seen it, let me know.  It's essay crunch time again, which means I've been  piahing  or at least trying to  piah  for my essays, 1 due next Friday, and 3 due the following Friday. As you can tell, my days are packed and dreary, and I've gotten to know the Law Library pretty well, at least the section where I spend sitting on my butt and reading/typing.  On an upside, next week are the John Mayer and Emily of Emerald Hill performances. Quite excited for it. Yes, I know, strange that I'm going to see Ivan Heng in drag (once again) as everyone's favourite  bibik  in Melbourne, when I can see him in drag back home, but I think tix are much cheaper here - only paid $19 for an evening show. Plus the theatre's so close to home, I can walk there. I wanted to check out other shows as part of the Melbourne festival too, but unfortunately, with essays and all prob. don't have the time.  Am also on a job hunt for Nov/Dec/Jan summer hols. This Customer Service Rep. job sounded quite promising, and they pay $16 an hour, so that's good. But I gotta revamp my CV first though, 'coz I think I need to sound more dynamic in order to get the job, instead of just blah blah, I did this and that. I'm taking tips from this guy at the seek.com.au website too. Now I just have to get around to doing it b4 they close applications.  On an upnote, tomorrow me EG n charles are finally going to the IMAX theatre b4 our 3-month ticket expires. Such a waste of money if we don't get around to using it!  Anyways, I'll prob. write more interesting stuff next week. Not that my life is entirely very interesting anyways hehe.   Tata  Oh yes, btw on Chuckie's recommendation, check out   urlLink this guy . We're planning to do something like what he suggests, giving out useful items and maybe cookies during Christmas, to the homeless.           "

791,Capricorn,"       Listening to: Landslide - Fleetwood Mac  -  I successfully fell asleep in Klaas today.  First time I've been able to do that.  It's weird she didn't notice, because I'm in the front row.  She was reading some poem when I konked out, and I woke up in an instant, but everything was silent.  Scared the hell out of me.  Apparently we were supposed to respond to the poem I slept through.  Can somebody help me out?  -  Over the weekend, I finally got back into Fleetwood Mac.  Good stuff.  -  I've been so pissed at my computer.  I don't even wanna get into it.  -  Thunderstorms are the most frightening weather pattern ever.  I mean, Christ, the rain is fine, it's just the large rumbling sounds and large streams of static electricity I'm nervous about.  It's not unreasonable.  -  Cranny is getting slowly more and more intolerable.  It's fucking incredible.  And his class is boring right now, because, well, you all know.  Oi.  -  Now that I took that goddamn nap in Klaas, I can't sleep, this sucks.  -  For some odd, odd reason, one(or more) of my teachers nominated me for Link Crew (I refuse to call it 'Thunder Crew').  Apparently, they're trusting me with the fragile psyches of a group of incoming Freshmen.  Ooh, this is a perfect opportunity to be mean to a few freshies (Just kidding, I'll be good...)  -  Salad!    "

794,Gemini,"        Maybe you'll not notice, but I'll tell you anyways... It's Tuesday morning & it's in th AM, & Im awake at 6:30a.m. now that sucks!!  Anyhow, this past Saturday Kat & myself went to HW Cinema & watched 'Underworld' on the Ultra Screen!!  If your into Horror/Sci-Fi then you will more than likely enjoy the Vampire/Werwolf action movie...  I sure did!  Yes, it did remind me of the 'White Wolf' RPG 'Vampire The Masquerade' but thats not a bad thing... Not at all.  It just sort of 'lent' that background & setting.  The action was intense & the politics & plot & subplots was well put together.  Overall, I walked out pleased.  Go see it!  Well, tonight after work at HW, will be stopping over at one of the guys house to play some 'Hero Clix'!  Should be a fun time, we decided to play some 1v1 games.  Easier to understand what is going on & less confusing for new players.  Plus it helps them & me to develop new strategies.  Bought myself a few single Hero Clix at House of Heroes in Oshkosh yesterday!  Veteran Dove, Experienced Hawk both from the DC set... & a really cool piece that I've been looking to pick up for a while... Veteran Wolverine!!  He just rocks!  Why??  Cuz... He's the best there is at what he does & whats he does is not very nice!!  So, I'll have to find a way to fit Wolvie into my X-Man team tonight at least once to see how I do.  Guess we are playing at least 2 games...  So should be a good time.  Wish me luck, I'll need it!  Sometimes, the dice, just dont like me.  =(    Kevin from work also borrowed me the movie '28 days later' he downloaded off the net...  It's the horror thriller with the plague of zombies that is wiping out the world or something to that effect.  I'll let you know what I thought of it after I view it.  Oh, & one more thing for those peeps that rent movies are running low on 'new' movies to rent... Take a look at 'Pool Hall Junkies' it's a pool movie of course as the name might suggest, but me not being interested in pool all that much I still really enjoyed it.  A LOT in fact...  I've been recommending to everyone that is struggling to find a movie, so give it a look see!  We'll talk again soon!    *May The Force Be With You*          "

796,Pisces,"             With Ash unable to make it last night, the spotlight focused on Ms. Emmet, who, while brought in initially to be the aggression’s first and only drummer (and quickly became my favorite member of the aggression), has become quite the impressive guitar player in Hypefactor. Because of changes made to the track she initiated, THEY’VE JUST, we re-recorded her guitar parts and tried different variations of it (i.e. acoustic and electric guitar takes), so we have lots to play with. As always, her focus and desire to see things come out perfect is a blessing. Once that was out of the way, we recorded her playing some Noel Gallagher style rock guitar on NEW SONG (obviously, just the working title), and by God did she turn this song into the rocker I was envisioning. Robin’s a really talented musician and my intention will be to make sure she is never underutilized. And yeah, she’s my favorite member of Hypefactor, too. Between Robin, Ash and B, I feel quite fortunate to have all these talented people working on my “solo” album.  We loaded 1956 in the computer, but because of our Robin-centric evening, we will get to this song during out next session, but everyone seems pretty hot for it.  Back in the other musical universe, our friends in Dubsinth back in St. Petersburg Russia have handed in their remix of THESE MILLION NIGHTS for the forthcoming aggression EP. Yura, aka Atom Fear, has really delivered a great, slow, moody, and cinematic remix that will fit very nicely on the final CD. Awesome work!  Sino, from Japan, informs me his remix of DREAMS TO DEATH is finished. Hopefully, I will be able to write about it shortly. Also, Cyanotic, an industrial band I know from the Midwest, wrote to tell me they should be delivering a remix on or before 10/1. Of course, my musical Alzheimer’s has kicked in and I can’t remember what track I gave them. Anyway…  Danny-Boy informs me I missed the NYPDBLUE season premiere. I must really love this album to forget such an important event. But there is no more important television event this year than the 24 season premiere on, I think, October 28th. I need TIVO. Immediately.  F          "

Oy, well at least that's why I'm having problems getting a fricken job! And guess what?! The Disney Store is hiring! I wanna work there so bad, but ya you have to be 18!

But no really I suck balls at that game except today when I was playing with Emir against Nick and Joesphine I scored 10 goals, ok 9 Nick scored one for us, it was amazing and ya we won! Whoa!

799,Aquarius,"        USPS New Stamp   This one is impossible to believe.  Scroll down for the text.  If there is only one thing you forward today.....let it be this!       REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of PanAm  Flight 103!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the World  Trade Center in 1993!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the Marine  barracks in Lebanon!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the military  barracks in Saudi Arabia!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the American  Embassies in Africa!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the USS COLE!   REMEMBER the MUSLIM attack on the Twin Towers on 9/11/2001!   REMEMBER all the AMERICAN lives that were  lost in those vicious MUSLIM attacks!     Now the United States Postal Service REMEMBERS and HONORS the  EID MUSLIM holiday season with a commemorative first class  holiday postage stamp.   REMEMBER to adamantly and vocally BOYCOTT this stamp  when purchasing your stamps at the post office.     To use this stamp would be a slap in the face to all those  AMERICANS who died at the hands of those whom this stamp honors.   REMEMBER to pass this along to every patriotic AMERICAN you know.   I got this in an email today and I'm not sure whether to laugh hysterically or weep for the vapid stupidity of Midwest America.  Yes, all of these bombings did of course happen and were perpetrated in the myth and pretense of religion, but does everyone in America not even remotely acknowledge unpleasant history? If we don't talk about it I suppose that perhaps it didn't happen, but Christians have been slaughtering people in the name of religion for centuries.  The Catholic Church is unfortunately notorious for its frivolous mass killings to squelch rebellion and further its own agendas through out time.  We may not be as predominant in the media as far as the murder for religion goes today, but Christianity in particular feels its own righteous presence with God as the fundamental religion endorsed by the almighty forces of the Higher Power, and we strut our Peacock dance all across the forest floor encouraging contempt for any of those that think differently than us.    And really the first line is what bugs me, anyone with a god damned computer can spread this ignorance all across the globe, they don't' need to check their facts, they don't need to ensure that they're correct in their assumptions, they just twitch their little fingers across the keyboard and there it is. They have no moral obligation to the furthering of truth and enlightenment.  So the first line... They don't believe in Christ. Actually they do, they believe that he was indeed a messenger of God sent to do God's work on Earth, but since Mohammed is the seal of the prophets, then Christ cannot be a direct prophet from God. But I'm knitpicking here, I despise organized religion for these exact reasons.  Luckily we're showing a nice trend of the reign of the church coming to a slow and agonizing end. No great dynasty goes out of fashion without a last hurrah though. A little Armageddon anyone?     "

That love can save and heal all wounds.  That it's powers can push us through any obstical and chang ethe future of all man kind.  If only that where true.  My most recent experiences with the 'Love Phenomenon' have provine otherwise.  This drug, which should be illegal, can control minds, shorten breath, and most definitely kill a man.

804,Gemini,"        Ferrari has announced the official name for its all-new 2+2 model – the 612 Scaglietti, which goes on sale next summer. Named after famous Ferrari coachbuilder Sergio Scaglietti, the 4.9-metre long, all-aluminium 612 will blend the perfect combination of performance and comfort in the best traditions of a true Ferrari berlinetta designed to accommodate four people in high-speed luxury and safety.   For the first time, Ferrari will manufacture a 12-cylinder model with both the space-frame chassis and body panels in aluminium, built entirely in-house at Modena, Northern Italy, in the dedicated Scaglietti light-alloy technologies facility. The benefits of this construction method include a 60% increase in structural rigidity and significant weight savings of 60 kg compared to the current 456M GTA – despite the new car’s larger dimensions.   The overall layout – engine mounted behind the front axle, gearbox in unit with the differential at the rear – ensures an ideally balanced weight distribution (46% front, 54% rear), as well as permitting a lower centre of gravity, which benefits the dynamic behaviour of the car. The performance-orientated handling is enhanced by active damping and a new stability and traction control system, making its first-ever appearance on a Ferrari. The 612 will run on 18 inch diameter front wheels with 245/45 tyres and 19 inch rear wheels with 285/40 tyres.   The 612’s 5748 cc, 12-cylinder, 48-valve, 65°V engine is a product of the most advanced Ferrari technology. The all-aluminium power unit has a compression ratio of 11.2:1 and generates a maximum output of 540 bhp at 7,250 rpm, with 434 lb ft (588 Nm) of torque at 5,250 rpm. The new car is expected to accelerate from standstill to 62 mph (100 km/h) in 4.2 seconds, and to achieve a top speed of 196 mph (315 km/h).   All 612 models will be fitted with a six-speed mechanical gearbox, with a choice of manual, and F1-style paddle shifts. Newly developed for the 612, the electro-hydraulic system is known as the F1A. It is designed to deliver both fast and ultra-smooth gear changes.   Designed by Pininfarina to epitomise dynamism and elegance, the 612 brings the name of Sergio Scaglietti back into public awareness. Scaglietti is the coachbuilder who brought to life some of the most beautiful Ferrari models in the 1950s and 60s. The new 612 features scalloped sides that recall the famous 375 MM he created for Italian film director Roberto Rossellini as a gift to his then-wife movie-star, Ingrid Bergman.   With a significantly longer wheelbase than the 456M, the 612 has been designed to offer ease of entry for rear-seat passengers to an outstandingly luxurious cabin which will accommodate four adults in comfort. On-board comfort is boosted for the driver – by the adoption of ‘new generation’ ergonomics for the instrument binnacle, steering-wheel mounted and fascia-mounted controls – and for passengers by the fitting of dual-zone climate control and a Hi-End Bose sound system, specifically tailored to suit the unique acoustics of the leather and aluminium trimmed interior.   The capacity of the luggage compartment has been enlarged to 240-litres – 25% bigger than the 456M – and will hold a five-piece Ferrari luggage set or two full sets of golf clubs. The new 612 model is 139 mm longer, 37 mm wider, and 44 mm taller than the 456M, with the wheelbase increased by 350 mm to ensure the latest Ferrari is a genuine 2+2 four seater.   First deliveries of the 612 Scaglietti in Europe are scheduled for March 2004. Prices will be announced later this year.             "

806,Libra,"             I must really get myself into a routine of waking up early and sorting things out around the house. Looking around me I can see a hell of a mess in my room, from my chair I can spy some Belgian chocolates which were bestowed upon me as a present on Christmas Day. I'm unsure whether to eat these or not now, I'm not sure if they'll taste horrid, and I'm going to feel guilty as I would waste them otherwise. If anyone knows what I can do with them then answers on the back of a postcard please.  Woke up at 8am again today, leaving me little time to get myself ready and leg it out of the house. Much to my annoyance, the gate that allows entrance to New College was locked  again , so after furiously muttering 'naughty sweary shit' under my breath, I walked around the building, thus making me a good five minutes late to school.  Maths really for me won the 'whaaaaa?' award for the day, or we could say the fortnight. After some really easy work in the past two weeks, we were given bitches of questions and work to do, and to add more insult to the injury, I had only woken up an hour before and was being watched by Mr Runham.   'Right Kev, what's 4 cubed?' *cogs in brain currently not running ... pause ... dirt becomes untrapped in cogs* '64 sir.'   Finding myself rather pleased to be out of the lesson when the bell went, I rushed off to my tutorial lesson, only to spend ten minutes of it outside my tutor class talking to Rebecca and Jessica. Finally went into my tutor class, to have my digital camers inspected by Mr Maher, whilst I ate a cucumber and tomato sandwich. Yes, I know Rebecca, please don't go on about sandwiches.  The next lesson was Art, one that I always dread on a Thursday and daydream of getting out. Take three objects and draw them, and the background. Do outline for this lesson, and then next lesson work on getting one and a half sections complete, and on the third week complete it.  I know I'm definitely not an arty person when it comes to me and a pencil, especially observational drawings. I find no satisfaction in drawing an old violin, jug and a purple cup. Oh wait, Rebecca doesn't like that purple cup, lets change it for a doll! Heh, I can't draw, and changing the cup for a doll made it all the worse, I protested.   'But I don't like that doll, change it please!'  I claimed, hoping that out of Rebecca's heart she'll agree and choose something simple to replace it.  'No, I want to draw it,'  she replied rather menacingly, and that was it really. I gave up all protest and just put up with it and drew what I could.  By the end of the lesson all I managed to draw was half the violin and a wonky jug, nevermind the doll, I wasn't going to bother with that for a while.  Scurrying quickly out of my art classroom I took the usual journey of going down the stairs and heading for the far playground where I usually spend my break. Unfortunately I couldn't remember anything interesting from break, just making sure that I remembered how to breathe and digest food.  After break I left to go to my DT lesson, in which I did nothing ... again. Its starting to annoy me that I do nothing in my DT lesson, after all teachers are paid to teach students, and not for us to just waste their time. The discussions during DT had varied a lot, from penis piercings to well, boyfriends and girlfriends; something that I lack excess knowledge of. I shut up for most of the lesson and as soon as the bell went, walked to my english lesson.  On the way to my english lesson a year 9, who is probsbly less educated than a braindead goldfish did something so stupid that she could of seriously hurt someone. She waited behind a door of a busy corridor, and when someone went to open the door, viciously kicked it sending the door straight into the person's face. Now, I am not making a rant out of this just because the two people it happened to happen to be my best friend and my friend, but because of the fact that in year 7 we have a brittle-boned student who is barely 4 feet tall. The corridor was full at the time, so he wouldn't of been noticable at all. Had he been there, and he had been knocked back by someone who was knocked back or hit in the face by the door itself, he would have been seriously injured. I considered hurling abuse to the person who did this, but I decided not to in the end as I felt it would of added more fuel to the fire and I would just be stooping down to their level.  I didn't do much work in my english lesson, until the last fifteen minutes where I quickly noted down an opening paragraph to a short story I may write in the near future. Rebecca said to me that it was 'all pwetty', so I explained to her that this is only how it will seem, but once read will change your opinion ... slightly.  Lunch past quickly as well to my disappointment, so I have nothing to say about it. I went off to Science quickly and remembered that I took no pictures during the break, bugger.  Science had continued its trend of being dull and boring, no matter what experiments or 'exciting things' we do. Brushing up on how to use a microscope didn't exactly interest me, so I just watched as Rebecca plucked hairs from Tricia's head, although in turn I did get hairs pulled from mine.  Refused to go home without a hug from Rebecca, and in the end, managed to get two. Muahahaha.  The New College gate was still locked, so once again I had to go the long way to get home, which caused me to arrive home about ten minutes later than usual.  The day after school has not been very interesting for me, I must of spent so far about fifteen minutes decided what to write and not what to write here, was thinking of avoiding the rant about the door incident, and then felt it had to be included.  I know this is a pretty long entry so far, but I'm going to give you guys a little treat, have some links that I've found in the past week.   urlLink Hey Hey 16K   I'm jumping on this bandwagon a bit too late here, its been around for about two weeks now and I've only just decided to blog it. Hey Hey 16K is a song composed by DJ Hibbett and animated by B3ta's very own Rob Manuel. The song is about the consoles before 16K had become popular. Oh how I wish I could play Jetpac...   urlLink La Haine - £15 On Play   I've heard very good words about this french film, so this will have to be one of my next purchases. To save myself some time, I'll put up its description from Play.com, and I'll have you know that the guy who directed this also directed Gothika.   La Haine is packed with sharp street humour, intense action and brutally brilliant camera work.   Police viciously beat a 16-year-old housing estate kid they are questioning, leaving him almost dead. Responding to violence, teenagers from the estate turn their home into a 24 hour war zone. Among the people blinded by hate are Said, Vinz and Hubert, youths who survive on petty crime and dealing dope. In the intensely volatile environment, the teenagers find a chrome-plated Smith & Wesson 44 that a plain-clothes cop has lost. If killing a cop with his own gun doesn't express their rage then what will?   The French cabinet commissioned a special screening of this tragic story on its release, to see the problems of the angry French underclass on the streets of Paris.   'A brutally brilliant masterpiece of 90s cinema' - NME    urlLink Andy Kaufman Returns   The author of this blog is supposedly Andy Kaufman. He claims to be the real deal, the man himself. For one of his entries he posted a press release in which it states that he has taken DNA tests and had his fingerprints checked, all pointing that this is indeed the legend Andy Kaufman.  There are still those suspicious of all this, but if Andy Kaufman did fake his death, then why has he announced it on blogspot?  Keep an eye on this one guys.   urlLink Insaniquarium Game   A link that has been lurking around my favorites for a long time now, its time to dig this one up from the dead. Concept is simple. Keep fish fed, make them grow, collect coins, destroy aliens. Strangely addictive.   urlLink Arnie's Pizza Shop   Matt send me this link some time ago, and I found it hilariously funny for some reason.   'I'm not here now, I'm out killing pepperoni!'   That will have to be all for now, until something else of interest happens to me. One more thing to do though, I'll have to pimp Rebecca's blog to hell. She is at  urlLink prettyh8-machine , and will probably have something more interesting to say than I do.  I'm off now to do things, toodles!         "
807,Cancer,"       Good evening, mortals. I sincerely apologize for my lack of posting over the past few days. I have been busy dying in a flurry of English literature essays, Biology enzyme papers, and Calculus...er...calculations. But Calculus, despite the constant vigilance it requires, goes rather well methinks. I find it quite enjoyable, to the dismay of several of my colleagues.  Becca and I spoke today about significant figures in chemistry, because significant figures are    THE MOST VAGUE    sectors of science in general. She figured them out without my assistance. I was useless (oh well).  I can see Elise and Laylee daily now! Indeed, I am permitted to see Elise early in the morning at school because I get to the school building earlier, and I may see Laylee following lunch period C when she is leaving AP English and I am heading towards mathematics. Happiness, I daresay.  I should like to post a prompt poem that is utterly crap. I posted it on DOY because Alanna demanded that I do, and I dare not deny her. But it is crap. The prompt was '[   ] is a lazy hush fuck', 'Danish cookies', and 'NOOOOOOOOOOOO' (count the O's damnit, they count!)  This thing got 74 comments. But a majority of them were the ramblings of Sirs Jerel and Nick of California. I am confused with Sally, so some people might think of me as female. But I am not! I am male! I won't prove it right now, but take my word for it.   All around the world in 180 days My little book swept me off Feet grounded in a puddle of calculations Broom, I’m a witch sorcerer Paths of oxygen to six, seven continents Spiraling past the airplane window And a little child presses his nose to the plastic Makes a face Skip from North America to Peru Ziggurat steps climbing Arch over the stone cold apex My stomach’s talking to me – snow cones Fly over to Antarctica, scoop Another scoop, frozen rain Hopscotch up the eastern coast of Africa Flying carpets are popular now – cheap Greasy salesmen in turbans and sunglasses Times never change My brain cries, Danish cookies Zip up to England for tea time and Buttery crumpets Hover over Japan for an hour or two Neon maze Sushi fish, sushi rice! Little Japanese men make a computer chip And cry “NOOOOOOOOOOOO…” When their exhale snaps the silicon Let’s sit over the Arctic circle Earth’s attic Not time to return to school Never, never again To listen to the teacher, he’s a lazy Hush fuck, hush puppy fuck Rambling For a century about a century When some obscure dude from – where? Drew steel Ramble, ramble, no course or preamble Just like these lines.   By the way, the prompt was constructed by lovely Morgan of DOY.  I am an alien. Elise says so. I am also an Elizabethan Greek. Because Elise says so, and don't argue with Elise lest she smite you utterly.  Cheers, humans.    "
808,Pisces,"             Despite not being here for a few months, California is just how I left it: Sunny, hot, and filled with the usual suspects. I flew into town early to check out the rough cut of a certain movie that I am associated with that stars The One and current favourite actress who irene hates who lives near MOGworld despite being from accross the pond. I'm happy to say after 8 years, this movie has been worth it as it is great and you will hopefully all see it early 05.  The sweet irony of it was that the next day, while sipping tea at the Four Seasons at a table next to kevin Spacey (who has a very large head, yet is more handsome in person than you would think), the same current favourite actress came walking in looking nothing short of amazing and justifying my longtime love of her. Cheers, Ms. W.  I was only in LA briefly this week, sharing my time only with my lawyer/agent/advisor (now en route to NY) and cool as hell nephew who is the best. Thanks to Irene's moms for yet ANOTHER great meal. Cheers, Mama Bradish.  I'm now in San Diego for ComicCon and it is quite frankly overwhelming. Its too big, but the Star Wars stuff is great this year and I type while wearing my new Original Trilogy tshirt. God somehow blessed me that I can live with a hot chick, put out records, and make movies while being a HUGE geek of epic proportions. And no, despite what some may tell you, I am not dressed like Han Solo for the convention.  Being here at the moment puts my musical life on hold, but my art career is taking off. I have been asked by a new band (featuring ex members of my favourite all time industrial rock band) to create the new logo and look for the unit. I am excited about the challenge, so cheers to Ash and Ass Cobra!  Ill try and write back regarding the con, but quite honestly, its going to kick my ass until I head back to LA on Sunday morning. I will then be in NYC for only a few weeks before Irene and I FINALLY make our way to Europe for the long awaited vacation. We will hit the UK and pay a visit to the French. We will be lazy and eat well and see Primal Scream with the Louches. This is a good life, kids.   In the meantime, if youre in SD, say hello and come visit me at the Warners presentation tomorrow. i think you can figure out which presentation Ill be at with bells on.   Also, for you Hollywood types, read VARIETY today and you might see yours truly mentioned there.  F         "

810,Virgo,"       Absolutely Ridiculous English Spelling    Why does the English language have so many words that are difficult to spell?  The main reason is that English has 1,100 different ways to spell its 44 separate sounds, more than any other language.  Some of the results of this are:   Words that have the same sounds but are spelled differently,    Words that contain letters that have nothing to do with the way the words are pronounced,    Words that contain silent letters; that is, letters that must be included when you write the words even though they are not pronounced,    Spelling rules that have lists of exceptions - words that do not follow the rules and thus must be memorized separately.     This situation exists because English has adopted words from many other languages, or at least has partially adopted them.  Very often, English has accepted the new words with their original spellings, but has not always adopted the original pronunciations, or pronunciations were changed by common habit or political expediency, but the original spellings were never changed to match the new pronunciations.    The reasons for the Ridiculous English Spelling do not matter, however, because  English is what it is; it has been this way for a long time.  If you want to learn to speak and write it, you must learn it as it is and not how it should be.  Our task is to make it a little easier for you.        To order Free 'Absolutely Ridiculous English Spelling' lessons by e-mail, or to buy the lessons on a CD, floppy disk, printed on paper, or on Audio Cassette, go to our Order Page.    Some common inconsistencies:  Pattern Examples  How they are pronounced   words containing 'ough' thought, bought, fought, brought  enough, rough, tough, slough  through   though, although, dough, thorough  cough  bough, doughty   end with sound of 'ot' as in POT, NOT  end with sound of 'uff' as in STUFF  ends with sound of Long U, as in the word THREW or SHOE  end with the sound of Long O, as in NO or GO  ends with the sound 'OFF  contain the same sound as 'COW' or 'NOW'     Words that sound the same but are spelled differently. byte, bite, bight  seen, scene  hear, here  sense, cents, scents  their, there, they're  feet, feat  ate, eight  err, heir, air   Long i + t  Long e + n  Long e + r  all end with the sound of '-ENCE' or '-ENSE'  Long a + r  Long e + t  Long a + t  Long a + r    Words containing 'ight' alight, bight, flight, light, night, might, right, sight, tight, plight, fright,    In all of these words, 'ight' is pronounced like Long i + t.  Words with Silent Letters gnat, gnaw  know, knee, knife, knit, knickers, knuckle  psychology, psychiatrist, pneumonia  should, could, would  isle, aisle, island  wrap, wrinkle, write  debt, doubt  often, listen, soften, castle   All of these words are pronounced as if the red letters were not there, but when you write the words, you MUST include those letters.     Some more inconsistencies:  Ways to spell Long 'U' shoe, grew, through. do, doom, flue, two, who, brute, duty  Ways to spell Long 'O' go, show, though, sew, beau, float, bone,  Ways to spell Long 'A' may, weigh, late, pain, rein,  great  Ways to spell Long 'E' free, bean, magazine, gene, mete, be, mien, receive, believe  Ways to spell Long 'I' fine, rhyme, fight, align, isometric, bayou   The chart above is just a small sample of why Spelling Rules in English can be almost as much of a problem as spelling itself.  Notice the 'i-e' Rule:  Use i before e, except after c, or when sounding like a as in neighbor and weigh.    This is a nice, neat little rule concerning words that have the letters i and e together, usually  to form the Long E sound in English: i before e, as in piece or relief.  Then the rule says 'Except after C'.  The ie becomes ei , as in receive and deceit.   Now you know that the Long E sound in English can be made by 'ie', unless the sound comes after 'c', in which case it is made by 'ei', (except for those times when the Long E sound is made by 'ee' or 'ea' or 'e' or 'i' or 'oe').  Then the Rule tells you about another exception - when the i and the e are together in a word and are pronounced like Long A, the e must come before the i.  Examples: neighbor, sleigh, weigh, freight, etc.  In this one short Rule, there are already  two exceptions to it covering dozens of other words, but that is not the end.  There are many words that do not follow the Rule or its exceptions: seize, weird, neither, either, foreign, sovereign, forfeit, counterfeit, leisure, heifer, protein, geiger (as in 'counter'), height, sleight, feisty, seismograph, poltergeist, kaleidoscope.   At this point you may ask, 'What can I do about it? How can I figure out how to spell the words in this crazy language?' Believe it or not, there are a few things you can do that will help, but after you remember the rules and learn the 'tricks', you are left with this basic technique: Study, Memorize, Study, Memorize, Study, Memorize.  Exercise: For each of the words in the list below, write the definition (from a dictionary) and write a sentence using the word.  1. scene      2. seen      3. scent      4. sent      5. cent      6. err      7. air      8. heir      9. feet      10.feat      11. new      12. knew      13. hear      14. here          "
811,Pisces,"             It's been an incredibly stressful week thanks to my totally screwing up my laptop while trying to upgrade my powerbook to OSx. I've been through too much with this, so I dare not explain. However, massively public kudos to my significant other for handling my 'suicide watch' with a nice dinner at Wonton Garden. If my computer is salvaged, I will post in depth as to what happened and why and how. As for now, fuck it.  Brandt has gone on in depth in my recent absence regarding certain events and for once he is mostly accurate. The session with Ash was fun and to hear the edited drums for the first time really got the adrenaline pumping. It made me want to get this record out next week, but sadly there is still work to be done.  As for The Twilight Singers gig, my memories, based on copious amounts of Sake, Beer, Gin and Tonic and the DREADED Jagermeister are as such: the gig was too short (in my drunken mind it was a half hour), they played no Whigs songs (they played several), and Dull is, well, a fat fuck. I supposedly screamed this loudly. This is my attempt at being more 'British.' Also, I recall me and my friends huddled and hopping up and down singing along, which also means we have seen too many British people at gigs.  Last night we checked out the always impressive Saintface. They were fun and energetic and peter's CONSTANT abuse of Matt Gentile from the stage was super fun ;-) Before I start bitching about their album not being done, they ARE doing rough mixes now before bringing a mixer in, so they are in good shape. I am also told that I will be lucky enough to hear these rough mixes. Peter if you're reading, PLEASE don't forget me, Ill even give you NO notes at all so i don't fuck anything up ;-)   Also, Peter needs to watch out for crazy Goths dancing in front of the stage. HEY, this aint Joy Machine, sister!!  Saintface opened up for a band called Blondes, Inc. who I liked in a BRMC club kinda way. I thought the rhythm section was tight, allowing the keytarist and guitarist to drive the vocal melodies. I bought the CD, so I'll decide then if I like them or not! However, they were smart enough to invite Saintface to open for them, so that's a point in their favour. However, the scary couple making out next to Irene was wayyyy too distracting. You had to see that one.  In the end, we had a good crew and the face guys are always nice. Peter and I have settled on his singing two songs for EXIT STRATEGIES, which he has yet to hear, but those songs are called CLEAN UP and EXIST. I know that these two tracks will be massive with him on vocals. Also, I breathe a sigh of relief that he is doing those two songs as we have always had these songs in mind for him. He was the last piece of the puzzle for this record and now its in!  The aggression are making their return to compact disc later this year with a rare remix making an appearance on an upcoming compilation in the US. It will be Needleye's awesome remix of MY WHITE NOVA and I'll send more details when it's all official, etc.  While Brandt is editing, I have started to slowly move the HF Live Machine forward a bit. There is no timetable to play, but there is an idea as to who should be in this band. Besides Me, Brandt, Robin and Ash, I'm happy to report that the last aggression keyboard player, The Kidd, now is the first Hypefactor keyboard player. Honestly, I think this is a more exciting gig for him than the aggression. It's more of a challenge. I'm told Robin is concerned juggling two bands is going to be tough when it comes to playing live. I disagree and plus, double bills could rock! Assfactor, anyone?   I'm back in the studio tonight for bass overdubs, then we're checking out some Death Cab on Thursday. It's a good life, kids.

812,Aries,"           The only arrogance I personally see in Bush II is his language which places him and America as the representatives of Good, capital G, and our enemies as representatives of Evil, capital E.  This kind of language scares and enrages me, regardless of the speaker.  Any other disagreement I have with Bush II et. al. is a matter of philosophy or economics.  As to acts of will:  I'm not sure that limiting another's options to agreeing or stepping aside is necessarily an accurate definition of non-arrogance.  Consider the State planning a freeway or landfill near one's neighborhood; it tells the residents to agree or step aside, and not to stand in the way -- after all, look at all the State does for its citizens!  Wouldn't the residents percieve such a policy as arrogant?  It seems to me that expecting (or demanding) no one to stand in one's way smacks of a kind of arrogance.  Also, I'm not convinced that acts of goodwill are points to be cashed in later when one wishes to act with abandon.  I may be wrong; perhaps in terms of history and foreign policy, they are.  Did we really defeat the Soviet Union, or did the Soviet Union fall victim to its own geography and internal corruption?  P.S.  Keep Angie in your thoughts -- the recent flareup of her fibromyalgia continues to cause great pain and sadness.  Today's visit to the rheumatologist revealed some new strategies, but no new information.  She's truly my hero -- anyone else in her conditions (and they are plural) would have given in to depression, cynicism, and bitterness long ago.  That she smiles and sings and laughs and dreams is a tribute to the depth of her courage and the size of her heart, and I'm not saying that just because I love her.  If more people could shine a light like hers, the world would be a far better place.  May we all learn that the secret to happiness is perspective, gratitude, and the love of a beautiful person.         "
813,Cancer,"           My mind is having a revolution of some sort I swear. It was just last week or like 3 days ago where I hated everything and was pissed off at so much and at myself. I was sick and I didn't feel like I was going to get better and I had so much homework too, I was so stressed out and I didn't want to deal with anything at all.   Now, I'm starting to get back on track. Not only am I feeling like ten times better, but I'm actually really happy again. I think I have more positive thoughts then negatives thoughts for the first time in a long time. Ya sure I still hate school and feel like I suck in that area, but I'm gaining confidence in hockey and that is helping soooooo much. I've been playing first line and working my ass off and just the accomplishment I give myself is really all I need.   Basically, I'm starting to do things on my own and actually stick up for myself. Sorry if I get pissy at you or anything or yell at you, but I'm just sick of so much shit that is so unnessicary to begin with.  It's so much added stress that I clearly don't need, so now I'm done with taking everything I get from people in and I'm not letting people treat me like I have no feelings because seriously I'm probably one of the most emotional people I know. I'm done with people making me feel like I'm the size of an ant and stepping up to the plate and addressing the issue. No more Mr. Nice Guy or Mrs. Nice Girl anymore.  Actually, I'm being way more positive on everything, I'm looking towards the positive side and going from there. From now on if people aren't giving me support, I'm going to tell them, and well I already kind of had. I'm one of those people who can get all the support from people they can get otherwise I have no confidence level at all. I'm also addressing issues not only that I have but multiple people have and trying to change something that should be changed and should be more positive.  I'm no longer going to be affected by other people or my negative thoughts and try my best to do my best and not get down on myself so much because that's one thing that I can get my hands on and change to make my life one step easier.  Although I'm still like totally utterly confused about my life and where it's going and about guys and what I really want, I feel like I've finally gotten a grip on my life to make it really go where I want it to go. I have more control over what I can do then what I can't do and what I believe I can do then what I believe I can't do. But hey you never know all this positiveness has really just come out of my ass and I may be bitching again in a week.

815,Libra,"                   so there they were in the cotton candy shack. just bo jangles, mr.johnreed, caitlin, danielle, and the weird little kid.ever since they had been trapped in the shack, their brains had been on over drive trying to think of a way out of there. but of course the naughty bo jangles wasnt thinking cuz he was withdrawing from pot and cuz he is dumb. bo wasnt helping at all cuz he kept saying here was like no way out and that they would all die. and all of a sudden out of no where they started to hear the jeepers creepers song, so of course they got a little freaked out, cuz who wouldn't.but danielle assured them that jeepers creepers wasnt going to hurt them, but instead help them. bo jangles, being his stubborn self, didn’t believe what danielle was saying. so bo got on the ground and started to gnaw on the bark floors and chant ignorant things. so caitlin went over to him and slapped him silly. so, of course, jeepers creepers showed up and brunt holes into the shack, with his eyes. in no time there was a hole big enough for everyone to get through. but jeepers creepers sensed fear in the little boy and he liked his bladder so he had to the little kid against the will of the others. but jeepers creepers, who was not bob anymore but a Canadian organ grinder. so the group thanked jeepers for getting them out and he flew away into the sky.{bye-bye:(*tear*...} so they returned to the qwest to find tacos. about 30 mins later bo jangles gave out a scream of pain. he had been bitten by a bug. johnreed, being an expert on bug bites, had seen this rare bite before. it was called a boss bug and if it isnt cured it could turn into amy's disease, which john had done a prodject on before. since they didnt have a can of tuna or a cacti they were going to have to let bo go through the horrible disease.so what else could they do, aww yes, return on their adventure. after an hour or so bo became,well to be very blunt, BOSSY. really bossy. he was telling everyone what to do and all of that kinda of stuff. so everyone decide to plot against him and put oragel in this mouth(which would make it num and stop him from talking.) john tricked him into drinking the whole bottle by telling him it was toothpaste and that his breath smelled really bad. being so full of himself he took it all in. after he had done so he looked like he was retarded. so they were still wondering through the corn field, but much faster,cuz bo couldnt tell everyone he needed to go to the bathroom every 10 mins, so he peed his pants a lot. then out of nowhere, in the middle of the corn field, was a tall man, who was about 7' 6 and was wearing a black trench coat and his hair was gelled back. he looked troubled or like he was in shreah for something very important. the group approached the man. they asked if they could help with anything. the man asked if they had seen e.t. , his long lost son. caitlin brust out into laughter and told the man, pointing to john, that john was e.t. john tried to tell him he wasnt, but the man wasnt going to take no as an answer. the man told john that he just wanted to make sure he was ok and that he wanted to make sure that e.t was happy on earth. john said yes. the man kissed and hugged john and then said,'fairwell son, and good day!!' john was pretty weirder out but he passed it off. by time the man had left the numbing gel had worn off and bo jangles began to act like his bossy self once again.but not only was he being bossy, his ego began to grow bigger and bigger. it was the size of a hot air balloon. he started to say that he was better then everyone else. so everyone was getting pretty hungry, and to their surprise in the middle, what would lie, but a meatloaf restaurant. when they walked they noticed the banner above their head it stated that the meatloaf was magical and that it was abundant and free. so they sat down for a wonderful feast of meatloaf, when, u guessed it, bo jangles began to fight with john. saying that he could eat more meatloaf then john. so bo,of coursed, challenged john to a meat loaf eating contest. john accepted because he is johnreed the kun-fu master that will never turn down a challenge. so they had the contest,. bo ate 15 loaves and john ate 3. so bo jangles went around celebrating his victory over john. but soon he got sick and puked out all 15 loaves of meatloaf. everyone started to laugh except bo who started to cry and he had a pity party for himself, nobody else joined cuz:-1. they were eating magical cheesecake and real cherries from the garden outside.and-2. bo smelled really bad. so after the cheese cake and the party was over they continued on their journey.&nbsp; after a while bo was so over whelmed that he fell into to the ground and began to say really crazy thongs about mongooses. so john being john had a little talk with him about his attitude. but bo&nbsp; wouldn't comply so john poked a presser point on him and they left bo jangles to die in the corn field of never ending corn..&nbsp; without the presence of bo jangle the group seemed to be doing alot better then they had been doing. u get the point. as the day turned to night they got tired and made corn beds like the Indians made and they fell asleep. they were awoken the next morning by the screams of john, he had had a bird poop on this face, which was really nasty and gross. but he wiped it off with a cob of, u guessed right, corn! so after a breakfast of creamy corn(by the way john had begun to get a yellow tint to his skin.,lol)they continued on the qwest,it wasnt to long before the corn ended and a street was now in front of peeps. they started to walk down the road when they noticed an ALDI's grocery store. they walked in looking for someone&nbsp; so they could ask where the heck they were. but as soon as they walked in who else would appear but the naughty, egotistic BO JANGLES.&nbsp; everyone was in shock. how did he manage to get to the store before they did.l bo jangles explained that as soon as they leaf him aliens abducted him and did weird things to him, like put silly putty in his brain and dye his liver purple. but that they had to stop and get some raisins .so they let him go cuz they were done with him. besides the fact that no body believed in him. but they were pretty mad at him so it really didnt matter. so bo had a dollar so he bought a bottle of ketchup. because he liked ketchup. and john remembered that he had a dollar in his shoe so he bought a container of&nbsp; mixed nuts that were also meat flavored.(how convenient for john,lol.) so they left the store while the girls were still trying to figure out where they were. but nobody seemed to know. so they left in disappointment while angry drug users tried to sell them street drugs and highway streets. but danielle insisted that they had 2 of everything. so as the girls pushed the crazy people out of the way, they rejoined the guys who were enjoying their treats. bo opened the ketchup bottle and took some in and spit it back out, cuz it was horrible. it tasted like crap. so bo jangles marched back into the store and complained about it to the person in charge. the sales worker took out a pistol and told bo to get out of the store if he didnt want 2 unwanted presents. bo sulked out the store and he shunned the store. he came out while the girls were making fun of johns mixed nuts. john, being an awful nice person, offered to share his new found treasure. but everyone declined, even bo,who would get anything. it made john kinda mad, but the wonderful taste of the meat flavored mixed nuts made him forget about his sorrow.&nbsp; while walking&nbsp; down the long street john decided that it was time for a sing along, so he took out his banjo keyring but bo that it was a ghetto idea and then insulted john by telling him that he was really ghetto. john, not like being called ghetto for any reason, got mad and bit off 2 of bo's fingers and ate them. bo was in a world of pain. not to mention that the blood was everywhere. but nothing could really be done. bo, in a word, was handicapped and mad.(i wounded why??) so danielle and caitlin played doctor and wrapped up bo's flesh wound. but somewhere in the middle danielle went over to talk to john about the word'ghetto'. which didnt make john to happy. soon the 2 were fighting over ghettos:real or made up. but they came to a tie b/c danille changed the subject to bo. john still mad said he was sorry to bo.&nbsp; but bo was still really mad at john for what he had done, so he wasnt talking to him. so what else could they do but continue on there qwest.bo still upset started to sing the song,'stacy's mom.' over and over again. everyone thought it was kinda weird and sick, but nothing else could make the sad boy happy. so then john got mad b/c he saw a pile of rocks and he got depressed b/c he thought even a rock whould reject.the girls tried to tell him different and hold him that he was not acting rash. so then about 2 days passed when they came across a road that intersected with the one they were on. the road was named ocean ave. john got really excited and started to jump and scream and lose control of everything. john finally got control and told his peeps that road ended in his back yard, and it was only about 4 miles, and that they were going to be home by night time. and was good because they were tired of liven in the presence of corn and need to take a bath. esp. bo jangles b/c he smelled of puke and ketchup. so they skipped home. and when they got there all of there parents where there and they all acted like nothing had happened.which was weird. but nobody wanted to ask qwestion. the only person that had gotten in trouble was john b/c all of the parents had come up with this crazy idea that john had kidnapped all of them. so john couldnt watch the sci-fi channel or any other channel(except weather) for a year. cuz he must have seen the prank on some movie. and nobody wanted to get into trouble so they just agreed that was what had happened. so they all made it home safely never to tell what had happened! I think the only qwestion was, did bo and john make up?? well thats a story for another time.  by:danielle c-2004. holla.!!!!! &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;        "

819,Libra,       Hey bec.. why can't you go Friday??         
820,Libra,"             Yeah.... The latest week for me has been meaning work... All days, even today, Saturday, which kinda sucks, I work in a Supermarket called ALTA in a city 5 km's from where I live, that means that I have to ride 5 km's on my bicycle to get to work, and the same to get home, and I am  lazy !  But one week is well passed, also have to work next week. When all this is done, there is only a couple of days left of my holidays for this time, can't believe 6 weeks has already passed at this time. I'll be starting on my second year on HTX (Higher Technical Exam (Upper secondary school)) on Tuesday the 3rd August, and I am in no way looking forward to it, I hate school.  Tomorrow I'll have a visit from one of my very good friends from school, called Marc, we'll be geeking with our computers for a couple of days :)  For other news, I haven't been able to pull myself together to get read anything at all in my book for the latest days - The Da Vinci Code - which sucks, because, in some way I have to be done with it before I start in school again, there won't be time for much else than school reading when that time comes unfortunately.

Today the first steps have been taken towards my team integration, and am hoping that this will make some sense in life and wont be yet another flop show.&nbsp; Because if its'a flop show, there is more to lose than gain in this!&nbsp;   Need to go and purchasea gift for my dad today, wondering what to get him.&nbsp; This time we will be visiting his ruling deity temple on his birthday, so am super happy over that.&nbsp; Am praying that this trip goes off well for everyone, coz it's a trip which will hopefully bring back the happiness to my entire family!  &nbsp;           "
822,Taurus,"           Great  urlLink photo-blogging  going on over at Dogtulosba (Chad's place).  Chad's an Army Engineer, and it looks like they got to drive around APC's and blow up mine fields they'd just set up.  His weekend sounds like a shitload more fun than mine.  I sat home (Thursday through now) with some nasty stomach flu.  Only now (3:30 Sunday afternoon) am I finally starting to feel better.  Way to kill a weekend, eh?  In any case, in some interesting news, I did just go to the shooting range, and fortunately for my fragile ego, I left the targets there, so don't expect me to post any pictures.  Let's just say I offically suck.  I am, however, going to make an attempt at doing something about it.  I took a gentlemans biz card, and I think I'm going to start taking some basic lessons.  I need to learn the uber-basic shit like how to hold the god damn thing for one, and how to 'squeeze, not pull' the trigger (though I may have that backwards - lol).  In any case, yeah,  I can't shoot for shit.  Do need to learn though.  In other 'good' news, I noted that they have the  urlLink GODFORSAKEN S&W 50 cal  for RENT.  FOR FIVE FRICKIN DOLLARS.  They don't immediately mention, however, that the ammunition for the beast costs $40 for 20 rounds.  /kickinthenuts  I'll save that for when I have friends to share the burden, or at least take pics of me laughing my balls of when I shoot it - the gun that's designed to basically kill any non-armored (metal plates) living thing on the face of this earth.  Well, maybe an exaggeration, but it is designed to kill any game animal - including bears and boars, two of the nastier animals I can think of.  I wonder what it'd do to a blue whale, not that you'd want to shoot one... but, you know...         "
823,Virgo,"       h-dropping  h-dropping occurs initially in words like hit, hammer, happy, hedge (examples in this section are from Wells p.253 ff.). It can also (though less frequently) occur mediall in words such as Wolverhampton, Birmingham, Tatham.  In most accents of English underlying /h/ is realised phonetically as [h]. The underlying /h/ often contrasts with zero to produce morpheme alternation. Thus we find hall vs. all and heat vs. eat.  Note: [h] is a  voiceless glottal fricative - or, in other words, vowel without vocal cord vibration and with added frication. In most cases [h] is a voiceless frication-rich version of the immediately following vowel.  In some accents of English underlying /h/ is often realised as zero, or sometimes as a glottal stop. Wells (p.253) refers to this happening in 'most of the working-class accents' (p.253). He sets out two models:   there is an underlying /h/ (our model) which is deleted,   there is no underlying /h/.   For us, hall and all are phonologically distinct (hall has the underlying /h/, but all does not), whereas in the alternative model there is no underlying /h/ for hall - thus making it identical at all levels with all.  Word initial h-dropping occurs in RP (Received Pronunciation) and CE (Cockney English), though not in SE (Standard English) or EE (Estuary English) [the four accents this course concentrates on]. Most accents of English will regularly zero word medial  /h/ in examples such as Nottingham, though this is usually not obligatory.  Hypercorrection can often occur (when trying to 'talk posh'). Here a word with an underlying stressed vowel may well have a [h] 'mistakenly' inserted.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [ i ] becomes [ I ]  In almost all accents of English [ i ] has replaced [ I ] in final position in words such as happy or coffee. Another way of saying this is that in word-final position the vowel is realised phonetically as  more tense than it used to be. This has been a gradual shift since the Second World War (at least) and has been noted in particular in accents of North America and Britain.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  l-vocalisation  In English there is a single underlying /L/. That is, at the underlying level of the phonology (or at a phonemic level) there is only a single l-category entry. A phonological rule (note: not a phonetic one) substitutes a palatal /l/ (or clear /l/) before a vowel and a velar /l/ (or dark /l/) before a consonant or in word-final position. Phonetically these go on to be realised as phonetic clear or dark [l].  The process of l-vocalisation means that dark /l/ becomes phonetically a non-syllabic vowel rather like the one in SE book. In some speakers the process is so strong that, when heavily stressed, the vowel may take on the characteristics of a syllabic vowel (i.e. the nucleus of a separate syllable). In these cases a word like wall can become bi-syllabic for some speakers (especially CE speakers).  EE, SE and RP are all seeing the introduction of the trend toward l-vocalisation - with the degree of penetration greatest in EE and least in RP. Wells compares this trend with the earlier r-dropping in words like car or better (p.259) in terms of its impact on the pronunciation of the language.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  glottalisation  The voiceless plosives [p, t, k] are often preceded in some accents by a glottal stop. The phenomenon is referred to as 'pre-glottalisation' or 'glottal reinforcement', and according to Wells seems to be a 20th century phenomenon. The effect occurs  when [p, t, k and the voiceless alveolar affricate] come in syllable final position   when [p, t, k and the voiceless alveolar affricate] are preceded by a vowel, a liquid or a nasal.  [A list of example environments can be found in Wells, p.260.]  Although some speakers of RP, SE and EE sometimes use glottal reinforcement it is commonest in the north, around Newcastle. It seems to be a regional phenomenon, and accents of London (CE), Glasgow and Edinburgh as well, according to Wells, many rural accents of southern England (e.g. East Anglian accents) is gaining ground, particularly in reinforcing [t].  But it is important to distinguish between glottal reinforcement and glottal substitution. In some accents, particularly CE, glottal substitution takes place. Here there is a complete replacement of [p, t] with a glottal stop - with no residual of the oral stop articulation. The replacement of [t] is more likely than [p], and occurs only infrequently with [k]. Some researchers report glottal substitution in northern accents around Leeds and Manchester.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -ing variation  -ing variation refers to a surface variation quite commonly observed between [n] and [ng] in final position in words such as running, making.   [Note: [ng] is used here for the velar nasal to substitute for the usual IPA symbol which may not be available in some web browsers.]  It is also possible for the entire syllable to be reduced (when unstressed) to a syllabic [n] - the 'true' vowel disappearing altogether. As Wells points out (p.262) this can result in some pairs of otherwise phonetically distinct words becoming homophonous, e.g. eating and eaten. According to Wells  At the present day it seems that almost every English-speaking community exhibits a social or stylistic alternation between the two possibilities, the form with the velar nasal being 'high' and that with the alveolar being 'low'. But there is evidently geographical variation in respect of the point in social or stylistic stratification at which the changeover occurs. In Birmingham, England, it appears that the velar form extends well down into working-class speech, while in Birmingham, Alabama, the alveolar form extends well up into middle-class or educated speech. (p.262-263)  Note that as with h-dropping hypercorrection occurs with this phenomenon. It is not uncommon to hear the words chicken or garden pronounced with the velar nasal. This is often associated with CE in the minds of many English speakers  - partly because CE is automatically associated with working-class speech. Hypercorrection never occurs in RP, and seems to occur only rarely in SE or EE.      "
824,Pisces,"             Been spending some time hanging out with Irene at home and working on loops for Jared's new project, which I think he would describe as 'broken word'. He's working with Mark Spyby of Dead Voices on Air, and they've asked me to send them loops and noises and such to work with. I've drafted B into this as well. I've got some ideas flowing, certainly enough to send them in the next few weeks. Dunno anything more about the project than that. However, it's nice to be asked to be a part of it.  My pal Gilez, he of the reknowned Armalyte Industries, was kind enough to send me a copy of his label's latest release: Haloblack's THROB. This version is slightly different than the one I've had for a year or so. The final version has an new track called FEEL which might be the best track on the album. It's fast and synthy and sexy and different for Bryan and co. Honestly, the album needed this as well, as the pacing is a bit on the trip hop side. However, that works for me as I quite like the album. Also, a track I hadn't heard called PERMANENCE towards the end really adds some nice atmosphere to the album. The production is super and the mastering job is top notch. It's 'throbbing' out of my new Bose speakers right now (thanks Irene).Of course, the Raymond Watts cameo is always welcome. As I have mentioned elsewhere, I am curious to see how the die-hards respond to it, especially after reading some of the reactions to the Chemlab album (which range from 'I love it' to 'I like it, but it's not Chemlab').  Grabbed the new CURE box set and was quite pleased with that. The sound is great and while I am a big fan, I didn't own anything on this other than maybe the song from the CROW soundtracks. Therefore, this package is a big win. I'm weird and very unlike my mates with certain bands like The Cure and Depeche Mode in that to me their later years are more interesting to me than the early stuff. I mean, you KNOW Matt Gentile (even if you dont know him) sits around listening to STANDING ON A BEACH and SPEAK AND SPELL while I sit around listening to WISH and SONGS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION, thinking these are the classics. Anyway, this Cure Box has given me an appreciation of those early years and a lot of solid remixes and B-sides from the later years to make me happy. This Box is a winner.  Made a trek out to my birthplace last night in Brooklyn, to check out the 'Face at some club for hipsters. It was an awesome venue, with a large stage and nice sound, and this made very a VERY solid evening of Saintface. Big crowd too. Cheap drinks as well. Two hipsters were dancing next to me. The venue and atmosphere obviously amped the band up quite a bit as they gave one of their best performances I have ever seen. Also, the re-introduction of YOU COULD BE MY SECRET was ace. I wonder if that means its on the album, Peter? Anyway, I think band was in good spirits and always my time spent chatting away with the lads is always welcome. Peter informs me the album is progressing nicely. Oh how I want that album!   After, G and I, with a few pints each in us, ran to a KFC drive through while they were closing and each bought a biscuit. They had no honey, which G was very pissed off about, but they had plenty of butter spread, which i threw at Matt and Jax. All and all a fun evening.  Now I am off to the Isle of Long to watch me drummer in action as we record her for HF2. More later on that.  F         "

826,Aries,"           a very sad tale from a scary city  A Roll Call: Decrepit Rooms to Wrong Pills   Broken Homes | The Operators: Voiceless, Defenseless and a Source of Cash (April 30, 2002  As operators and providers profit from adult homes, state inspection reports show that many of their residents go untreated and unbathed. Here are excerpts of findings since 1998.  ANNA ERIKA 427 beds, New Brighton, Staten Island  Resident with dementia wore urine-stained clothes for three days. Another had lesions draining onto clothes that went unchanged for two days. Another hid in room for days without eating or bathing, and was not hospitalized. While inspection going on, workers completed long-overdue records. Many residents complained about getting wrong psychotropic medication. When pills were missing, workers borrowed from other residents' prescriptions. Resident hospitalized after receiving wrong pills. Worker flushed pills down toilet instead of distributing them.  BROOKLYN MANOR 216 beds, East New York, Brooklyn  Resident had old and new blood stains on face and body, and was filthy. Staff did not respond to emergency calls from rooms. One resident lost 54 pounds in a year; home did not determine why. Records were inaccurate, incomplete or nonexistent. Worker signed that she gave medication to all 200 or so residents at 9 p.m., when she was not on duty. Kitchen and many rooms infested with flies. Residents made to work as janitors and in kitchen, in place of employees. One resident in charge of home one evening.  GARDEN OF EDEN 202 beds, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn    Operator routinely threatened residents with eviction, verbally harassed them and demanded compliance with unlawful rules, creating abusive environment. Medication handling chaotic, with psychotropic pills given haphazardly and at wrong times. Resident vomited for two days, no one called doctor or family, or monitored her. Meals meager and unappetizing.   LEBEN 361 beds, Elmhurst, Queens    Rooms so decrepit that 60 residents evacuated. Security guards distributed pills. Incontinent resident wandered home with wet pants. No activities in home, numerous fire hazards. Many residents 'ill-groomed and malodorous.' Workers 'psychologically abusive' to residents. One resident burned in fight, another shot.   OCEAN HOUSE 125 beds, Far Rockaway, Queens    Rooms infested with cockroaches. Residents sleeping on soiled sheets. Kitchen floor rotted. Widespread hazardous conditions due to dilapidated home, ongoing renovations. Operator and son accused of embezzling millions of dollars from home and Medicaid. Serious deficiencies in medication handling and residents' hygiene.  PARKVIEW 134 beds, Olinville, the Bronx  Anorexic resident allowed to deteriorate so much that she weighed only 76 pounds and then died. Of 15 case management evaluations sampled, none completed. Numerous residents not receiving psychotropic medication. Workers did not know basic first aid. Resident refused to sleep in room because roommate harassed him and had history of violence.                  "
827,Virgo,"       I cant believe that im actually making another online journal/diary thing. The last time I had one of these I was in 7th grade. Seems a little immature to go back and make one. But like I told Matt, I enjoy typing a lot more than I like writing. I remember back in Middle School, EVERYONE who was anyone had an online journal. I still don't really get why people write about their secret issues like they would in a private journal/diary online, on a PUBLIC journal thing. Doesn't really make sense to me, but hey...im doing it aren't I? Anyway...I remember I had my online journal till the middle of 9th grade, then after two incidents I decided it wasn't worth it anymore. The first one occurred at the end of my 8th grade year with one of my close friends at the time, Teresa (she moved away, up to West Palm Beach). She obviously had an online journal as well and was actually one of the people that talked me into starting one. Well, to sum up Teresa, she was never the cool cheerleader that everybody liked or even the nerdy art student who everybody knew but pretended not to. She was apart of our little 'click' at school that everyone seemed to stay away from. And of course, people always made fun of us for the way we dressed and the music we listened to. It was so immature, but I guess that's middle school. Its funny cause I look back on it now and I think to myself...God damn was I a fat little idiot. And I see my sister going through the same fazes and changes that I did in/at her grade/age (wow, that's confusing to look at). Anyway, so we were all made fun of a lot and whatever. So Teresa writes about it in her online journal. And I think this was all about one or two years after the Columbine incident. And she's writing in her journal that she's gonna get these kids back before the end of the year and blah blah blah. But of course, all of us know she means just like make fun of them behind their backs because that's Teresa. She doesn't have the balls to walk up to one of them and hit them in the face. Or for that fact, bring a gun to school and shoot everybody up. So somehow somebody in the school reads that entry and decides to turn it in to the School board. And of course my journal has a direct link to hers and vice versa and I wrote stuff like that too in mine, so im not the little innocent angel either here. Well, we are both brought down to the office and blah blah shit happens. They talked to us about the 'seriousness' of this situation and all that other garbage, whatever. In the long haul, Teresa gets expelled and I get suspended, for like a day and then my dad goes down there and raises hell. And well, that's the reason Teresa moves up to West Palm. I feel kind of bad sometimes cause we promised we wouldn't lose touch and I guess we really haven't, but we aren't nearly as close as we once were. I think that might have to do with the fact that she's doing drugs and drinking now, but whatever. Well, that pretty much sums up the first incident. The 2nd one happened with my first girlfriend. The summer right after 8th grade, I meet this incredibly hot girl in my neighborhood through my friend at the time, Johnny, who is actually her brother...go figure. She was such a nice person to me, knowing that I had never had any past experience with girls or anything. This was the girl I lost my virginity to...the sick part was, another girl was involved. That was the one weird thing about Jennifer, is that she was bi-sexual. She had this friend who lived down the street named Megan who was such a little whore and she was only 14. I think I was like just turning 15, so I guess im no better than she was. And Megan would come over and just hit on me non stop...I don't understand why, I was so fat and stupid then...still am, but...a little better. So anyway, we dated for about 3 months and then she broke up with me for some bogus reason, I forget why. I was completely devastated by this too, being my first girlfriend and all AND the girl I lost my virginity to, I was pretty fucked up by it all, so anyway. I knew the real reason behind it. It was because she wanted to date other people cause she was a whore. So yeah, I wrote about it in my online journal. And I called her a whore in it and blah blah and how we had sex in a threesome with another chick blah blah. And im guessing she knew what the address of my online journal was cause she showed her new boyfriend at the time who was this 6ft tall, in shape, knew martial arts, black guy. Yeah, bad news for me written all over that description. Well, I used to ride the bus home back then, cause I didn't have a car and Freddy hadn't moved down yet so I couldn't ride with him. So, one day I get off the bus and he for some reason rode our bus that day. Well, I have my headphones on and im walking home, and this guy decides he wants to fuck with me. He gets in my face and I take my headphones off. This dude doesn't say anything, he just hands me this piece of paper, which I find out later is my diary entry. And when I look down at the paper I look up right after and he fucking hits me in the face. He fucking sucker punches right in the face. Me, never being in a real fight before (only instances with which I've punched a kid out and held one up against a locker with one arm, I had never actually been in a fight with another kid swinging at me) fell to the ground like a ton of bricks. Woke up, walked home with a swollen face and that was that. I never saw the kid in school again though. I wasn't sure if he transferred or whatever...and Jennifer ended up moving so yeah. Those are my two reasons for not having an online journal anymore. Wow...I ended up writing a lot more than I had intended to. Well anyway, till next time...         "
828,Libra,"                 since 1998, i knew there was this book coming out, 'the storage box of tradition' by Ira Jacknis, which dealt with the relationship between anthropology, museums, and Kwakwaka'wakw art. i was pretty interested in that at the time. every few months I'd check to see if it was published, and it seemed to get caught somewhere in the publishing wheel. Once it finally came out (in 2002), it was prohibitively expensive. then, the copy in our university library system spent months in 'route' - basically getting its barcode stuck on. it always shocks me how slow academic publishing can be. of course, i'm not shocked by how long things at ubc can take. but that's a different (and *really* boring) story.   today i finally got my hands on this book (i'd forgotten about it for a while) and low and behold, it's got an entire chapter section devoted to some of the native-style artists I'm working on for my MA. I had no idea! As Jacknis' historical research is much more meticulous than my own, it'll help me fill in a lot of empirical gaps. i really look forward to reading more of this work - it seems very well written and impeccibly (sp?) researched. it's such a treat to find such a useful text!

831,Gemini,"       A great friend of mine recently emailed me an article from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The article is about how an act of conscience, like that of Army specialist Joseph Darby in Iraq, can truly change the world. Abu Ghraib was a sad statement on humanity. It frightens me how can people treat each other with such disregard. But people are also capable of touching the world around them in such profound ways and it's important to remind ourselves of that from time to time.  PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE Weekend Perspectives: 'An army of one: As Spc. Darby showed, an act of conscience can change the world'  Saturday, May 22, 2004  By Bill Shore   Army Spc. Joseph Darby's decision to report the abuses at Abu Ghraib to  his commanding officer powerfully affirms what playwright Arthur Miller  meant when he wrote that 'as improbable as it may seem, sometimes an  individual conscience is all that keeps a world from falling.'  If there is anything positive to be salvaged from the shattering disillusionment that is Abu Ghraib, it is that the next generation of leaders will learn that individual acts of conscience can ultimately  prevail over systematic abuse, repression, discrimination and entrenched power structures even those as seemingly impenetrable as the Defense  Department's.  By sounding the alarm, Darby triggered an avalanche of consequences including: congressional hearings, presidential statements, far-reaching changes in U.S. policy toward the interrogation of detainees, widespread political ramifications reaching from the Arab world to Prime Minister Tony Blair's re-election prospects, and possibly a decisive shift in public opinion about the war.  Darby's actions embody one of history's most unassailable lessons: Individual acts of conscience often create more sweeping change than  the official acts of large institutions. There are moments when those with  the least power, wealth, privilege or rank, those who may be feeling more  alone than they've ever felt in their lifetime, can have a greater impact  than could possibly be imagined.  History is replete with examples ranging from the legacies of icons  like Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., to other actions large and small:  When Herbert Carter refused to obey Lt. William Calley's order to shoot defenseless Vietnamese villagers at My Lai, he prevented additional carnage,  and his subsequent testimony about the atrocities led to the conviction  of Calley and widespread reform.  When in 1942, Jan Karski, a 28-year-old diplomat for the Polish  government in exile, crawled through a tunnel into the Warsaw Ghetto to see for  himself the plight of hungry and dying Jews, and then crossed the Atlantic to  inform President Franklin Roosevelt, it was a first step toward ending the Holocaust.  When Pee Wee Reese, disgusted by the vulgarity of racist baseball fans, walked over to second base to comfort Jackie Robinson with a hand on  his shoulder, Robinson's transition into the major leagues was  substantially eased by that solitary and gentle act.  When Oseola McCarty, a washerwoman from Mississippi, donated $150,000  of her hard-earned savings for a scholarship fund at the university, Ted  Turner was inspired to pledge $1 billion to the United Nations, saying, 'If that  little woman can give away everything she has, then I can give a billion.'  We tend to think that creating change requires an array of external resources and support: acts of Congress, great sums of money, large  standing armies, technology, vast research capabilities, or powerful lobbyists, relationships, and networks. Of course, all have their place. But often  the most sweeping change results from a single individual with none of  those at his or her command, but instead with the courage to follow his or her conscience.  That acts of conscience have power is not a new idea. But because  abiding one's conscience often puts friendships, popularity, career and  possibly even one's liberty at risk, each generation must discover anew the  faith that acting upon conscience requires. It is the faith upon which all  social change is conceived, the bedrock of every effort to serve country and community. It is what keeps a soldier in his platoon and a Peace Corps volunteer in her village when the odds of success or even survival seem slim. It is the impulse that holds the doctor to the O.R. and the  teacher to the classroom. It is the essence of the American character.  Years from now, Joseph Darby may only be a footnote in the telling of  even greater events that have yet to unfold. But he has forever reshaped the history of our time and not one of us has been left untouched by his  act of conscience.         "
832,Pisces,"       I surfed into this article by  urlLink  Wendell Barry  today -- and there are some things about it that really resonated with me...  He writes:    People in movements too readily learn to deny to others the rights and privileges they demand for themselves. They too easily become unable to mean their own language, as when a “peace movement” becomes violent. They often become too specialized, as if finally they cannot help taking refuge in the pinhole vision of the institutional intellectuals. They almost always fail to be radical enough, dealing finally in effects rather than causes. Or they deal with single issues or single solutions, as if to assure themselves that they will not be radical enough.    to me, he articulates many of the problems that i associate with participating in institutions (as well as social movements).  In some ways 'movements' are, i'm sure, more dangerous, because identity is more precarious for any given individual, and the sanctions of the group may be less anticipated -- and therefore more harsh -- than when within the protectively rigid structure of an organization.  Mandy and I are talking about these issues in our independent study -- and in my Mass Media class we were talking about how the emergence of the autonomous self was one of the precursors for celebrity culture -- that we had to be alone in order to need celebrities...  but the questions and issues seem to me to be so deeply intertwined with my, with anyone's quest for legitimacy, our need for importance, our desire for meaning, our direction for work...  are there institutions or movements with which we want to align our life force?    but if we don't, we're just nothing.  we can't exist in the world...  one more reason that being a prophet is a dangerous profession...

833,Gemini,"           I can't begin to describe the ways I loved this movie. It's been a few hours since I left the theatre, and I still have a big idiot grin on my face.  I could run through the flick, but instead I present to you a review I found on amazon.com:   I almost fell asleep, April 8, 2004 Reviewer: John from London, England Jim Carrey needs to stay from these weird, serious movies. They are all bad, but Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the worst yet. Clementine (Winslet) eraces Joel (Carrey)from her memory. To get even joel eraces her from his memory. They meet, don't know each other, and fall in love all over again. I think the point was love is love no matter what, but is was a really weird way of comeing to that point. Not only was it weird, it was boring. I almost fell asleep. I felt like I was watching a movie making experiment. (...).   Oh how I love viewer reviews.   Our screening had four walk outs. Maybe they remembered that they were missing Two And A Half Men on TV.            "

839,Capricorn,"                  My friend Catherine is back and we're going to continue our debate about modern vs. classic literature.   A: Ummm..where did we leave off? Oh yeah, you had said that you can relate to characters in modern literature more because they can experience things that you do. But the reason classic literature has survived so long and people still love it, is that the characters, even though they don't experience the same things we do, they at least experience the same emotions, which ties the centuries together.  C: I agree with you that classics have survived this long, but we need NEW old classics, so that in a century from now people will look at modern stuff and call it classic. Also in classic lit you have to think of reasons why you can relate to them, but in modern books its obvious. So why waste brain juice? (in case you didn't notice that’s really my only good point so I'm sticking to it)  A: Ok, first, I totally agree with you that we need “NEW old classics” (and I intend to write them.) But in centuries from now, according to your theory, people will relate to modern literature. How can that be? Centuries from now things will be different and people just like you will say, “I don’t like classic literature from the 21st century, I can’t relate to it, the people in those books don’t do anything like we do and I can’t relate to them.” The idea of classic literature is that it has themes and emotions that despite the circumstances carry on because we’re all human and that is they only thing that doesn’t change throughout the centuries. Modern literature is much more action oriented, with plot coming before character, which makes it very unlikely that they will be classics: they don’t have enduring themes. They speak to an audience which doesn’t like to take the time to think about things and that will be it’s ultimate down fall. To write classic books we need to read the ones we already have and study them, because they’ve proven their worth over time.    Catherine has to leave now, so that's the end of this part of our debate, but we'll have more later.         "

855,Aquarius,"                  “Mail, you know, stamps and envelopes?”   I’m working on a project that sent me digging through my past today. As I shuffled through three storage tubs full of scrapbooks, photos, and letters I caught a whiff of nostalgia. Two shoeboxes filled with letters grabbed my attention. I chuckled even before opening the box because I knew what some of those letters said. I gravitated to one box full of letters from my old pen pals. I was a letter writing machine in my younger days and had pen pals across the country. It was a good thing too, since that is how Ked and I first became friends and how we started our dating relationship. I oh-so-diligent in keeping my letters organized: sorted by person and by date. Keeping in touch with my friends was serious business! The majority of this particular box was from my dear friend Karen. She was my first pen pal. We wrote hundreds of hilarious letters to each other over the years covering everything from the crazy science teacher to our latest crush. I read one of her letters today and she closed it “love your friend since 1984.” I read that line and thought “1984, wow!” Then I realized “Oh my word, that was 20 years ago!!” Not many people can say they’ve been friends for 20 years. That means I was only seven when we first became friends and started writing – I had just learned how to write!!  As I sifted through the letters a series of thoughts ran through my mind. There’s something to be said about writing letters. Before e-mail and before cell phones with free long distance, letters were the main way of keeping in touch with loved ones. I love smelling the paper (so, I’m a little weird!) and looking at the handwriting. Sometimes there were doodles all over the letter and envelope and even the paper, stamp, postmark, and addresses say so much about the era the letter was written in. A letter is so personal, so friendly, so real. A box full of letters contains so much history, so much culture, and so much about who the person was back then.  I attended a class at a scrapbooking convention where a genealogist talked about the importance of letters and diaries. She commented how, in our current age of phone calls and e-mails, we are losing so much history. Unless we keep all those e-mails (and how many of you have hit the inbox limit and had to clean it out!) or journal in a diary about who and what we talked about on the phone that day we lose all that history for future generations. How many of us have treasured letters written home during war time, or letters pining for the love of our life, or a precious letter from someone who has passed on? There’s emotion in a letter that e-mails just don’t even come close to.   I’m an e-mail, blogging, instant messenging junkie. I would never go back to the days where letters were the main, if not only, form of communication. I love being able to hop online and talk to my mom and friends thousands of miles away about what happened today. I love cell phones and knowing in an instant I can catch my loved ones no matter where they are. But I think that by completely eliminating letters from our communications we are losing a piece of ourselves and our friends that can’t be reclaimed. So maybe the next time you’re tempted to send an e-card for a birthday or a “thinking of you” e- mail, sit down and write a letter. It’ll show that you really care because you took the effort and the time, and it’s more likely to get stored in a shoe box in a closet for years to come.

Cool as it is, bright as it seems...but there'isnt alot of students around that time...Guess every other students chooses a time as early as 10 to collect theirs...and only a couple of unlucky teens (like me) choose such a time where everyone is back at home, watching tvs and enjoying themselves...11.45 am is the time.   The first thing i saw when I entered the school...was DT! With 3 other pupils...Yep, all 3 of them are from my class...Dont know what's up with them...and DT...As far as I know, they must have commited something wrong that DT wanted to see all 3 of them. And from their faces, they aren't looking kinda good. Trying not to be nosey, I dragged my mom to my class...where Mr Wong (my form teacher) is.   Well, guess we were the last ones to be seen...There's someone in there...someone familiar...Ok, it's my sort of father's sister's son. (Well, I dont know how to call it, a long-distance relative, maybe?) Anyway, he was there...together with his...erm mother. At first glance, I thought it was my aunt. but then again when they came out, it was not. It took about 15 minutes for them before they come out from that room. And when they came out, his mother greeted my mom. And then when we entered, the first thing mr Wong said wad 'Your related one ar?' And I nodded...  And here it goes....my result slip. It doesn't looks pretty nice...I failed 2 subjects. Haiz...Oh well, guess I've to buck up for my final year..just like what I did last year! I aimed to get back my position for Top 10! Muahahahaha... I've noticed....I always get a pretty lousy results for Mid Year Examinations....and only when Final Year, then my results are of the better. This year, I'm not going to let my parents down either! Afterall, it's an important year! =D  Mr Wong goes on and on about how I can improve on it...and I'm determined to prove that I can do well...and I am made of something! Lolx.. He even suggested me to buy the Ten Year Series books to practise on. And oh yeah, he even asked for my home number...I sure hoped he won't call when I'm least expected. After all, I'm a good student!   Yawn...it's 3pm now..Guess I've got to stop. Today's kind of ok. I'm so bored with nothing to do now...Maybe I should go back on reading the comics...And I just can't wait for tomorrow! Haha, coz I'm going out to redeem the Jolin's Concert Tickets...Well let's hope that at least I could get them.   Laters!           "

Well, thats just a dream. but seems to last throughout the whole of my sleeping duration yesterday.but one thing for sure i've never been having thoughts of seeing them dead as soon as possible before.am having a big question mark for why issit that the 'deads' are people whom i seldom thought about.  okok,..today's eerie feeling, got goosebumps while reading the articles on september 11th. Suddenly theres a thought thst something will happen today or tomorrow, and i'm gonna be there to experience it.oh ya, one more thing, about the dream, i'm one of the dead also...thats why i'm writing this down....

863,Capricorn,"           First things first. I am slightly confused at times by Icelandic-English, but I believe not as confused as you would be by my English-Icelandic, so we'll stick to English as a medium of conversation, I guess (until we all master Icelandic). It might be tough for Lars, Magnus, Vegard, et al. to give up their 'primitive' tongues and learn Icelandic though (haha). Well, believe it or not, I hung out with an Icelandic girl last night. Yes, there are more than 2 of them. I couldn't get enough of Iceland, what with the sheep cheek and dried fish, so boy was I glad to find out my friend is dating a girl who grew up in Iceland until age 16. We shot the shit about all things Icelandic, from that crazy non-alcoholic malt stuff (child's play) to Thule. I exhausted her knowledge of Iceland in about 5 minutes, so I proceeded to teach her all the things Ulli (sorry I have no accent mark ` key) taught me about Iceland and life in general. So in other words, the conversation continued another week :)  Ulli prepared me well to educate her about her own country.   So, I've got my fingers crossed that this e-mail will actually send and I will not lose everything I've hitherto typed. You see, I'm still using the old dial-up modem, yeah the one from the 90s, and it's not the most reliable. George W. is off playing with laser-guided Smart bombs somewhere, and I can't even get a freakin cable modem. Blame my tightwad parents for that one, I suppose. Oh well, back to school in a few weeks. Then it's back to real studying and real classes. No more ESADE Leadership, where the essence of the course is 'do whatever you want and tell us that you learned something in the end.'

871,Aquarius,"             Somehow Coca-Cola has a way of summing up things so well.  In the early 1970s they had as their flagship jingle 'I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke' (to the tune of 'I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing') that pretty much summed up the post-Woodstock era so well.  It didn't add much to sales, but it was a catchy tune.  In Korea Coke's theme is  urlLink Stop Thinking. Feel it.  which pretty much sums up a lot about Korea and Koreans.  (Look at how relaxed that couple is, now that they stopped thinking and started feeling.) Of course they have a high regard for education and math and logic and such, but deep down I think many Koreans really like to work on emotion more than anything else.  Westerners seem to sublimate this moreso, or at least display it in a different way.  Maybe scratch all that...Westerners and Koreans are probably pretty similar, but the context in which we do it is different.  Anyways, if you think you're losing it in Korea just repeat to yourself 'Stop thinking, feel it. Stop thinking, feel it. Stop thinking, feel it.' and everything will be alright.         "
872,Sagittarius,"        Grrrrrrrr!  Ok.  The desire to hurt something has come back.  I have been desperately searching for one tiny, inconsequential little piece of paper that I knew I had handed off to someone at least 4 weeks ago.  He, in turn, handed it over to someone else for further processing.  Last week, I was asked about the status of that unimportant little piece of paper - since it was responsible for paying for the entire 4 day stay for a guest travelling from Europe, containing her credit card number, authorization for charges and approval from her bank!    NO ONE COULD FIND THE DAMN THING!  I asked again, please check again and again.  I really don't want to contact this guest and say, 'Oh. Sorry. Yeah, we lost that.  Hope you don't start finding weird charges on your card.  If you do, we had nothing to do with it!'  So, I asked one more time.  And I asked someone else this time, because I wanted to look myself.  Before I had the chance to look myself, this wonderful person informs me that he found the authorization right where it was supposed to be.    SO WHY DIDN'T THE ONE WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT DAMNED LITTLE SLIP OF PAPER KNOW WHERE IT WAS?  A week of fretting and worrying over nothing.   No wonder my eye is ticking along at a regular clip today.  Grrrrrrrrr!  Diva out.          "

876,Cancer,"       In my previous post, I made a statement that isn't entirely true.  I do have friends.  Not many, but I do.  I have become very selective about those who I surround myself with, to the point that I am not surrounded.  So, thank you to those friends for being the kind of people who I can let in.  I have been doing some thinking today.  And some talking.  One of my friends will not simply let me 'be'.  He doesn't do it on purpose.  (Well, sometimes he does.)  He is the kind of person who makes me want to be a better me.  Some of y'all know that trying to get me to open up about the really relevant stuff is like trying to do dentistry on a bear.  I have become a represser and suppresser in the interest of self-preservation, because I have simply become too tired for all of the angst and self-discovery and the gettinupoffofmyassanddoinsomethinaboutitall.  As I was sayin to him, I am at another one of those crossroads you inevitably come to in life.  But, due to the afore mentioned tiredness, I have just been sitting here park.  I am tired of going down the wrong road and having to either backtrack or detour.  I am tired of going along, minding my own business, and being broad-sided.  I am tired of coming to the construction, the traffic jams, and the idiot motorists who litter life's highway.  Trite analogy, but it's all I can come up with at the moment.  I have been shifting from park to neutral here lately, trying to get revved up to go somewhere.  I know I need to.  I keep running across people and words who make me think of who I could and should be.  This morning over at  urlLink Jett's , this post made me sit and ponder for a bit, and light a little fire of inspiration in my clogged up carburetor.  And from there, I was led to  urlLink this here post.   That sums up a lot of my feelings.  She says it much better than I can at the moment.  I need a vacation, y'all.

They said it's raining where they are and they are stuck in a traffic jam! (well, we can't all be lucky)   So yeh, my audition was alright, until I forgot this one line and it threw me completly. But never mind, I can always try again next year!    I went horse riding on monday with Jenny and Anna and it rained, alot! We got absolutly soaked and now I think Jenny has pneumonia!   I went shopping with mum yesterday and she bought me many things! I got some new converse shoes that are pink and I put pink laces in them. I don't think I will wear them tonight as the grass at Ashton Court will be very wet!   It's been a week since I last wrote properly (that's a long time) so mum will be going to yoga again tonight!   I think there are lots of things happening this weekend, if only I could remember them. Oh well, I have learnt to go with the flow and sort of just wait for things to happen and hope that they do happen (which they usually do) and hope that they are nice things!   I feel incredibly calm just waiting for things. You would think that I would be worried that nothing is going to happen but there you are! Maybe it's something to do with Norah Jones, (that's what I'm listening to at the mo) her music is soooo calming and relaxing!   There are many campervans and caravans going down our road at the mo, to the farmers field because of the festival.   It's like caravan city. The welsh caravans have all put HUGE welsh flags up. My mum drove past them yesterday and said 'do they want to be burnt down?'. You can tell she doesn't really like the welsh but it is true. Some people round here don't like the welsh so it's not a good idea to advertise that you are welsh by putting flags up around your caravan.  It does however, show that there is a little colonie of welsh people in one corner of the field (tres amusing)!   Oh dear, they can't help being welsh. Ummm...is that racist (I hope not!).   Anyway, enough of that.   Maybe I should stop writing now, this has turned into a small essay. Maybe I should become a writer, (any comments on this subject will be taken into consideration, just don't be rude about this statement) it make actually turn out as a more likely career than an actress or a farmer!

885,Capricorn,"           The following scene took place on a BA flight between Johannesburg and  London.   A white woman, about 50 years old, was seated next to a black man.  Obviously disturbed by this, she called the air Hostess. 'Madam, what is the matter'?, the hostess asked.  'You obviously do not see it then'?, she responded. 'You placed me next to a black man. I do not agree to sit next to someone from such a repugnant group.  Give me an alternative seat'.   'Be calm please', the hostess replied. 'Almost all the places on this flight are taken. I will go to see if another place is available'.   The Hostess went away and then came back a few minutes later. 'Madam, just as I thought, there are no other available seats in the economy class. I spoke to the captain and he informed me that there is also no seat in the business class. All the same, we still have one place in the first class'.    Before the woman could say anything, the hostess continued. 'It is not usual for our company to permit someone from the economy class to sit in the first class However, given the circumstances, the captain feels that it would be scandalous to make someone sit next to someone sooooo disgusting'.   She turned to the black guy, and said. 'Therefore, Sir, if you would like to, please take your hand luggage because a seat awaits you in the first  class'.

886,Aquarius,"                 Went out last nite. Had a great time. Went with my new friend M., first to a Greek Restaurant, which was cozy and wonderful. I had veal with mushrooms(yuck) and artichoke hearts(first time for everything again.. but not the best thing in the world) with some pasta.. which tasted great. Also tried grape leaves, which were really really wierd.  After that went to the mall, got some Italian ice cream, gelato I think its called, peanut butter... it was great..  yummy (so much for the diet.. hahah) walked around the mall (my feet are killing me.. lol -damn high heels) went to Electronic Boutique, one of my fav places in the mall. Didn't really see any new games out though. Had a good deal on Cruise Ship Tycoon though, 15 dollars I think. I wish I had money to spend on a new game...  like I need a new game.  Then.. after that, thought we could catch at 9 o'clock movie, so went to I think its called On Cue... its a music place right by the theatre and checked out the music. Went to the theatre only to find out the movie didn't start till 10. So.. we decided to buy our tickets, and he was out of ideas, So I suggested we go hang at Wally World.. lol (Wal-Mart).  So we browsed the toys, played with a few, sword faught, and talked about stories of the good ole days.. and I told him stories of my daughter.. and stuff like that. It was fun. Then we went and watched the movie, Big Fish. Good Movie!! Two Thumbs up..  hehehe..    It was  both funny and romantic, wasn't expecting the romantic part.  Good film for both chics and guys.. lol.  Well.. after the movie.. I went to the bathroom.. (of course) and went to wash my hands.. and they had auto faucets..  AUTO my ass.. they wouldn't work. So i came out.. (with soap in my hand.. and was like M. any men in that bathroom. ... he was like no.. I went in the mens.. and it wouldn't work either. I was ticked..  LIke what the hell.. NO running water?  So..  I came out and there was the water fountain..and he suggested i rinse there.. and so I did.. so if you ever taste soap.. blame  it on someone like me.. lol   SO after that I was looking for the manager.. and No.. employers were anywhere..    what luck blah  All is well that ends well..  It was a great nite!!  Sooo..   although last nite I didn't get much sleep because I had to get up very early to take my gram to my Uncle (great) Alvin's funeral, I'm doing alright. In pretty good spirits. Thought about guns, but no suicidal intentions. No cuttings. Was glad to see family I hadn't seen in years. I was lucky. Got pulled over by a police man for not having a inspection sticker, and he realized I had Kansas plates and apoligized for his mistake and let me go. Thank God. Because I don't have insurance on my car, and would of been in big trouble. Somebody was with my today. I have to say in the last 24 hours I have been a very lucky woman. Even though, I did get my car stuck in the deep snow in front of my mothers house.. and had to wait 3-4 hours for my step dad to come home and help me get it out.. and it (of course) only took him..  well like 2 minutes to get it unstuck.. lol (MEN... LOL)    Well anyway.. enough of my adventures. My spirits are bright, although my mind/heart/spirit/ are a bit confused as to what to do in my future and to what path do I chose. So.. .  I know.. to just move forward slowly .. and we will just see what happens. Wish me luck.                 "

889,Cancer,"       I absolutely LOVE  urlLink Jennifer Crusie .  I've read all of her books.  And I think this one has been my favorite so far.  I did not want this book to end.  I literally want to live the book!  How insane is that?  But seriously this book rocks.   Min Dobbs knows that happily-ever-after is a fairy tale, especially with a man like Cal Morrisey, who asked her to dinner to win a bet. Cal Morrisey knows commitment is impossible, especially with a woman as cranky as Min Dobbs. When they say good-bye at the end of their evening, they cut their losses and agree never to see each other again.  But Fate has other plans, and it's not long before Min and Cal are dealing with meddling friends, wedding cake, a jealous ex-boyfriend, Krispy Kremes, a determined psychologist, chaos theory, a frantic bride, Chicken Marsala, a mutant cat, snow globes, two Mothers-from-Hell, great shoes, and more risky propositions than either of them ever dreamed of including the biggest gamble of all--unconditional love.  (synopsis from  urlLink Jennifer Crusie's awesome website )         "
890,Leo,"       Salut à toutes! Hello!  This tuesday, i would like to talk about sports. Not like the guys tho, unless you want to. Personally, I like to keep my body busy with loads of activities (walk, blade, cycle, run, swim, softball, yoga, etc..) Keeps it and my brain happy. i thought it would be cool to talk about how we all compose with the daily realitiy of physical activity, what makes us feel good and why.   Since we`re talking about that and since I LOVE gelato, what do you say we all get some ice cream, have a chat while we`re there and then decide if we want to just go for a walk after that or if it`s crappy, we`ll relocate to an indoor location, maybe the Manx or the Pump.  So we`ll meet up at PURE GELATO on Elgin Street. I`ll have my cell if need be: 371-6352 @ 7:30 for ice cream, and probably move out of there by about 8:15 @ the latest.  See you then! Don`t wear lipschtick, we're licking some ice cream.....   Anne-Sophie.           "

892,Libra,"       Thursday night, I had dinner at a chain chicken fast food restaurant called Koo Koo Roo's in Studio City with my friend/co-worker. It was my first Koo Koo Roo's experience. I had a caesar salad with a side of some kind of orange squash mashed, and a lemonade. It was all right. It would have been great for a homemade meal, but it was mediocre for a restaurant. We went to my friend's apartment with the vague intention of working on his resume, but we ended up watching TV instead. I was very smitten with his roommate's pet bearded dragon. I found the scaly little beast very bird-like, like a lot of lizards are - the way he would look at me, an avian sort of intelligence in his eyes, and how he would move his head. His poop was like a bird's too. I found him very cute - I almost wanted to kiss his pointy lizard lips.  Saturday night, I saw the movie  Dodgeball  with my brother, sister, and my brother's wife and stepson. I wasn't all that impressed with it, but I was surrounded by people who were laughing uproariously. Then we went bowling, at which I suck. My brother bought me a Corona at the bowling alley. I had asked for a Guinness, but they didn't have that.  Lately, out of the blue, I'm having a love affair with Ivory soap, craving the bitter generic scent of it, and marveling at the history of it - Ivory.com says the first bar of Ivory soap was sold in 1879. I look forward to washing my hands with Ivory soap, and showering with Ivory soap. It makes me sting a little in sensitive places, but somehow I like that - somehow the stinging feels healthy. Not just healthy (here's my chance to use a million-dollar word, and also an opportunity to use italics) -  salubrious .  I've started reading the book  Atonement  by Ian McEwan. Here's a quote from it: 'And she liked the fact that he was so tall. It was an interesting combination in a man, intelligence and sheer bulk.' My sentiments exactly, although every guy whom there were the slightest grounds for calling my boyfriend was short. There haven't been many guys whom I could remotely call my boyfriend - I'd say there have been three such guys, but I'm of average height for a woman, and they were all either my height or no more than an inch taller, meaning they were short. I think I'm 5 feet, 5.5 inches. It would be so nice to have a boyfriend and be able to stand in high, high heels and put my face in his neck without having to crouch or stoop.         "
893,Sagittarius,"        Thanks  urlLink Fred    Just in case you are having a rough day, here's a stress management technique recommended in all the latest psychological texts    1.   Picture yourself near a stream.    2.   Birds are softly chirping in the cool mountain air.    3.   No one but you knows your secret place.    4.   You are in total seclusion from the hectic place called 'the world.'    5.   The soothing sound of a gentle waterfall fills the air with a cascade of serenity.    6.   The water is crystal clear.    7. You can easily see the face of the person you're holding underwater.          "
894,Sagittarius,"        Monday, bah humbug!  If you were to take a look at the past entries for Mondays, you'll see that I am just not a Monday person.  And here we are again.  I had high hopes for another fabulous fun-filled weekend, but all I got was a weekend of being sick and hiding under covers on the sofa.    It started off well enough, with a trip to the salon on Friday afternoon.  Nothing better than an aromatherapy scalp massage and a hairwashing.  Ahh!  Walked out of there feeling all diva-licious, but by the time I got to my office, the humidity had wreaked havoc on my new 'do.  *sigh*  Friday night was lots of fun, with more alcohol than a Diva should consume in one night.  Didn't get out of the bar until 3:30... in the morning.  Sure, that's no big deal for you maybe, but for me... that's practically marathon partying.  I got to play pool, and danced a little and had a genuinely good time.  But I payed for it on Saturday.    That's when the cold that had been threatening to take over finally won.  In my weakened -- or is it weekend *grin* -- condition, the cold conquered all.  I sat motionless on my friend's sofa during a playdate with the little divas, then got into bed around 9pm on Saturday night.  Slept till 2:30pm on Sunday, moved to the sofa, and moved in and out of conciousness the whole day.  Missed my friend's wedding, too.   And today I would really prefer to be back on my sofa, under a blanket.  But, dedicated Diva that I am, I am at work.  I don't know for how long though.  Diva out.          "
895,Aries,"           chris, i compared strom thurmond to adolf hitler, not trent lott. actually, i wasn't really comparing hitler to anyone in particular; i was showing an example of how a person can say something that is not overtly racist but could easily be perceived that way.    i agree for the most part with everything that jls said.  this controversy about trent lott really is just a form of misdirection:  so we aren't discussing real problems and coming up with solid and practical solutions.    and like i said in my post, i knew it was an extreme example - it was mostly for fun.

896,Leo,"       Well, I'm trying to sign up for classes and I'm having some problems. It seems that thanks to budget cuts all the classes I want are at times I can't take them. I can accept this, for now. So I'm thinking that I will talk to a counselor and see what classes I need that are in times I can take them. So I call up and try to make an appointment. This was my big mistake. I expected a department in a college to do something that makes sense (give advice to students before a semester starts). I was told that for now they are only giving appointments to people that are already taking summer classes. So in other words they are only helping people that already have classes and don't really need help. I was told that I couldn't make an appointment until school actually started, and even then I can only make the appointment once school starts, it would be weeks before I could actually see one.   WTF!!! So they only counsel people that have already made mistakes. Hey, glad you made an appointment to come see me, ohh look at this,  you took all the wrong classes and wasted this semester, should have talked to someone before signing up for these, but now it's too late to even add classes because not many teachers will let you after the first week...  THIS MAKES NO SENSE!! Why only help people after it's too late for the help to do any good! Why are there no sections of Calculus III at a time when I can take them, not only at DVC but also at Contra Costa Community College, Solano college, and Napa College. Are there any others I can try?   And I'm tired of people that use its when they mean it's, if you want to say it is use IT'S DAMNIT!!! The same goes with your, and you're. And what's with Yellow Cabs anyways, so what if it's yellow, doesn't have to be in the damn name does it!         "
897,Scorpio,"       I don't really have anything to say, and yet I'm talking{typing} anyway.  My thoughts are pacing back and forth across the chambers of my head, driving me mad with their monotony.  I hate depending on other people for my happiness.  Why can't I make myself happy?  Maybe not even happy for heaven's sake.  Just... content.  Maybe its just my mindset.  I shouldn't hope for so much. I   need  my knight in shining armor to come save me.  {too bad for me I'm not a damsel in distress locked in a tower in the twelfth century or something.}    "
898,Capricorn,"           Vegard, great pics. I'm sure I'll enjoy the captions more once my Norwegian dictionary arrives. What the hell does 'paa' mean? I think if I learn that one I'll understand Norwegian. Does 'og' mean 'and?' The Chinese cities truly are impressive though, aren't they? Skyscrapers like none other, and I live in the birthplace of the skyscraper. Do people take you for an American often? Have you found yourself a nice Chinese girl to settle down with and have card-carrying, chopstick-toting babies? I, too, was pleased to see Barca's success. Saw a kid in a Barca jersey the other day, and I started humming the song of the Gent del Barca. And you'll have to ask Ulli about the Owen-Kluivert deal. I'm sure he's found a website that tracks the daily activities and phone conversations of all of Chelsea's foes, Premiership or otherwise. Glad to have your input to the blog, Vegard. This blog gets to seem like a bit of a threesome at times, and when I think threesome I don't think Adam and Ulli.   Cheers, Tim         "

900,Aquarius,"       I embrace this day with enthusiasm as spring has finally decided to visit Bavaria.  Normally I do not allow the weather to rule my emotions, however after an 8 month long winter I was begining to question the meaning of life.  Yesterday a parka. Today, sundress, sandals and light sweater.  I promised myself that tomorrow I will pound out the first chapter of Titty Bar Metaphysics, a spiritual comedy about Reiki Strippers healing the Universe with love, light and nudity. It just occurred to me that if I took my clothes off I could evacuate half of Central Europe.  'Large, white pasty buttocks were responsible for half of Europe's departure for the sunny beaches of Spain today'  German's have tans even in winter.  I guess I could go to the electric beach for a little fake & bake to obtain that healthy glow. hum, the pale & pasty is actually the healthier choice. Have sun screen will travel 12 paces to my balcony as the Englisher Garten is not an option today.  The site of me could do permanent damage to unsuspecting tourist. I shall fine tune my procrastination skills to the sound of chirping birds and my own skin roasting beneath the Bavarian sky.         "

A Smile on someone else's face because of what I did for them. 4.  A joke which has no hard feelings, yet light hearted enough to make me feel the warmth of the joke! 5. A pleasant surprise...!

905,Sagittarius,"       And as she stood over the bed, lantern in hand, the stranger appeared. His eyes were green with red lines instead of pupils and he wore a bright blue satin tie with white starched shirt and no blazer. His pants were silver: as if they were made of the wrapping paper you get for a wedding anniversary gift. He did not speak for a what seemed like a few moments. Every moment creaked. The wonder of it all. She had cleaned up all her books, sorted out all her creams and bandaids, washed every dish, dried every tear, but now she knew why she hadn't done it earlier: didn't she need that emergency suitcase: oh G-d help me so that I may never need help from others. The dizziness was tremendous. Emergency suitcase. Her heart did palpitate. nothing: a friend betraying. Nothing: it did not matter, was all perception. Nothing mattered. It was so funny because the saddest things were funny. Love was a guttural disease. Love was measured in dollar bills. Love was a nonety. of all clouds: that was the New Haven cloud. dark, misty, brilliant, silver on the outside. delirious, she leapt on her bed, longing to break it. All the drink, all the glamour, the breathy voice, the shimmery lipstick, where was the pain if not hidden--raw raw raw the weather--the world was on edge, and the dance had just begun. She would keep on writing.          "
906,Aquarius,"                 Everything seems to be going ok. Moods are still swinging. I felt really suicidal on Thursday, even went as far as writing a suicide note. The sad thing is, both my mother and grandmother told me to do it. The one thing that stopped me was the fact that my daughter, well my aunt and I don't have the papers drawn up for my aunt to take my daughter. In a month when she comes up, that will be done. I hope that I don't feel suicidal then. I have spent the weekend with M. and his friends, and that has kept me busy, it actually keeps my mind off all the stupid things in my life and is rather enjoyable. They are really fun. It is nice to spent time away, and not have to worry about Darian also. I was moving in with my mother, but she pretty much kicked me out already, so I'm going back with my gram. Its ok, I'll suivive, I just hope she doesn't give me too hard of a time about the whole M. thing, because I still want to spend time with him. I didn't want to spend time  in the hospital, nor with my grandma or mom, I would of felt even more suicidal. I feel safe around him. It's nice to feel safe. I feel like I've known his friends forever and can kid and joke with them, just like they have been my friends forever.  I'm looking forward to seeing Shannon next weekend. :) I miss her so much. I have to get her present ready from Christmas time. We will see if I get that done. Will try to post more later, actually in the middle of a game with the boys..   :)                  "
907,Scorpio,"              Hair again  It's more or less faded now, so it isn't that orangey. Unfortunately the streak that I like on the front seems to have faded too. Not as dashing!  EG's family have arrived and are doing well, holed up at Oakford Mews, off Commercial Rd in South Yarra. Really looks quite new, very poshy and nice, serviced-apartments.   And Ethan is soooo adorable! He's only a year and a half, and he's already speaking and READING! and COUNTING! He can count to a hundred! And in multiples of two! And read Chinese words. And he knows the names of the authors who wrote his books, like 'Eric Hill' for his See Spot Run books etc. WOW. What a kid. And everytime he goes 'Aunty Sarah, Read' I just melt. What a guy. Cute, intelligent, and he smells so nice. Yummers.  EG got his new maroon Holden Vectra today. Not bad. Hehee...can't wait till I get to drive it around...muahahah...  Yeah..I guess that's more or less what's been happening. Haven't had much of a chance to blog 'coz been busy. Haven't even been on the Net all that often either! I really wanna get away for a weekend though, just to recoup and feel like I've actually had a holiday/vacation this summer, before school starts. And it's starting in 3 weeks! EURGH.

913,Virgo,"           Good news!  Iraq now has a fighting force trained by Americans with which it can handle it's internal affairs and defend itself from outside threats.  This 'army' consists of 1710 people all armed with AK-47s.  Wow.  Thats great.  They can totally handle all four of the major militias in Iraq, the millions of unemployed, angry citizens, and all of the outside threats.  Perhaps thats not as good as it seemed at first.  Luckily for the Iraqis, they have us Americans (the same people who are limiting their military) protect them.  And for this 'protection', we charge a small fee: their oil.  It may sound like we're some sort of organised crime group, but it really is a deal, if you look at it more closely. 1) We invade, then occupy Iraq, destroying their military structure and supplies. 2) We make their military (which did not engage US forces) illegal, and force it to disband. 3) We put Haliburton in charge of the petroleum industry in Iraq. 4) We establish the Iraqi National Task Force (INTF), limit their numbers to 7500, and train them all with ak-47s (we ain't givin' them any planes or tanks, or anything else they may need to actually maintain national security).  Actually, I can think of several things we seem to be after by doing this: 1) If we see a bunch of news articles right after 6/30 about how the INTF if quashing the anti-american rebellion, it looks like a)Iraqis really do want us there and b)Iraq really is sovereign, as evidence by their military. 2) We keep them weak so that we can maintain our occupying force with the excuse of protecting them. 3) We can take all their oil in exchange for protecting them, because they can't do it themselves with their artificially weakened military.  Actually, this all sounds very much like what the British did around 1920 when there was a rebellion in Iraq.  In fact, they even created a little, volunteer based military force, and kept their own military in place (we are keeping all 140,000 troops in Iraq, even after the 'transfer of power' on the 30th).   urlLink http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/771A6660-4D6C-462A-A987-BEF93FD2A14C.htm          "
914,Aries,"           Speaking of Russia, what in the world is going on here?  Russia became a junior member of NATO recently (like 2 days ago).  Correct if I'm wrong, but NATO was formed to combat the Warsaw Block (which died 10-15 years ago).  The Warsaw Block was held together by the USSR (aka Russia).  Why do we need NATO anymore if Russia is such a good friend that it is joining the very organization that participated in its defeat during the Cold War?!?!?  Something does not add up here.

919,Libra,"           Well I spent the night over at Harry's house last night with the gentlemen. Didn't do much, played videogames, DDR, watched some anime. That was about it. Though we did walk to chinese earlier, so that was good fun. I still have no word about that letter. No one has. Kind of upsets me, but there are signs of hope.  Since Sarah had to pull out on me for Warped Tour, it's gonna be just me and pops at the annual summer concert of the year. And because he still has back troubles, he asked me if I could look at another show. So I found one. A damn good one at that. I found the Curosia Festivle with -The Cure -MUSE! -Thursday -Auf Der Maur! -Interpool -The Rapture -Mogwai -The Cooper Temple Clause.  That means, me..live and in the flesh, get to watch, and meet,  (because I will NOT leave that show without meeting him) Matthew Bellamy play infront of my very eyes! Holy Crap! That will be so freaking amazing, I might just die. He's my ideal guitar-master, and has the BEST voice I have ever hurd..out of all of the other amazing singers like, Ace Enders, Brandon Boyd, and Matt Smasher. Matthew tops them all.  Its going to be like woah. But the tix are expensive. So hopefully that will be a striking iniciative for Dad to help me in my persue of meeting him. Like I said. I won't leave until I have an autograph and a picture! hehe. It's only fair tho! At this point, I don't care about not going to Warped. So for those who were maybe looking at going with me, sorry, but Muse is definitly worth it to blow off warped for.          "
920,Sagittarius,"       I had an interesting converstation today, made me really think about how I evalute myself and the others around me and their opinions. If I was to entitle this converstation:  Why Humans Suck So Much  and it was eye-opening. Sitting in the car, an interesting thought was proposed...why do we have friends? Why are there some people that we spend time with and share our lives with? Why does this happen?  Now this person that I was with, is rather negative and claims not to have any friends and prefers it that way. Then he explained his reasoning for not  wanting any friends ...and this is what I want to know share. I actually took something from this because there was no way to argue out of it.   'Everyone is this world will backstab, lie, cheat to better themselves. There is no one in this world that actually cares about how you are as a person anymore. The entire goal of the human race is to better themselves regardless if they are aware of it or not. No matter how good of a person or how christian you are, or how athesist, or how rich or poor, or criminal and sinful, in the simplest ways, you look out for your best interests. Example, man walking down the street (Man A) and lets say that Man A has $1000 in his pocket and Man B knew about the money and he could committ the crime and not get caught...what do you think Man B would do? What he couldn't fed his children? His wife has been laid off work? Man A has money to spare so he should share?  So Man B will look out for his best interests.   Alright, thats an extreme example, but heres a couple more... You're sitting on the toilet and run out of toilet paper as soon as your done wipping your own ass. You don't replace the roll because you are too lazy... or your at work and you leave something for someone else to do because you don't want to do cause you don't like it. Two examples of situations where...you have backstabbed someone. Backstabbed how? You have purposely left extra work for another person. You are looking out for yourself.   In every way, humans look out for themselves...I look out for myself. If I don't look out for myself who will? What?! Someone will call me selfish? Well...isn't that now what we are teaching our children??? Are we not teaching everyone around us to lie and be dishonest?  If a man came up to you and said, everything I say is a lie...is he telling the truth?   I want to go into politics...a career in which a normal human should thrive, as every person in this world has the qualities required for this line of work. You need to be able to lie, and cheat, and step on toes, and backstab all to better yourself. The average human does this...except politicans get paid for it.  Another example...you break up with someone and what is your first reaction? Reach out and cause pain...why?? Because it makes you feel better. Because you are looking out for number one...you are making yourself feel better about yourself.   If you don't have friends, you don't need to worry about being loyal to anyone but yourself. You look out for yourself, you help yourself...you get ahead in life.   Isn't this what our parents are teaching us?? To work to better ourselves? But do they realize at what this does?  We are just a thoughtless society.  You may ask...what about those people who volunteer their time and such...same thing. Same goal. Everyone is out for something and its better if we realize this truth earlier.   Am I saying...I don't want friends. No. I am not saying this. I am simply just saying that...this was a interesting concept. I am thankful for all that I have...but I don't think anyone understands what they really have. I don't fully understand...if I was so thankful, I would be able to give up everything...but can I? No, I am greedy and human.   Love yourself before anyone else. Love yourself before anyone else can. If you don't watch out for number one...no one else will.  With this...I look at the world with a jaded, hopefully will. I have my ideals and morals...and apparently I am up with 'Free Love'.  It is the experience, of what you make.     "

Also did the ALC (Australian Language Certificate) for jap today.

Then the vocabulary starts. Oh no. Then the backwards (to us) sentence structure.  Yikes!  Luckily there are many options for us slow-witted foreigners to take on the language.  Of course I could list them here but  urlLink this JoongAng article  says a lot and there are more resources  urlLink here .    Well, if you're a guy here is some motivation for you: Jeon Ji Hyun (전지현), the latest 20-something (24, actually) star of movies and CFs (I hear this means Commercial Feature, but not positive).  I saw her latest movie on Sunday night.  It's hard to describe the name...the English version is 'Windstruck' but the Korean version is 여친소 (yeochinso) which is short for 내여자친구를소개합니다 (ne yeojachingu rul sogayhamnida) or 'I'd like to introduce you to my girlfriend'.  Surprisingly, both titles make sense.  If you like, there is a website (Korean and English, looks quite good, actually)  urlLink here .  The movie is shown in theatres with subtitles at special times, that info is  urlLink here . For a list of many of the theatres in Seoul click....  urlLink here!    urlLink    Here is a great reason to learn Korean...if I wasn't already married, that is.

You never met a man you couldn't eviscerate. Not that mindless violence is the only avenue open to you - but why take an avenue when you have complete freeway access? You are the definitive Man of Action. You are James Bond in a blousy shirt and drawstring-fly pants. Your swash was buckled long ago and you have never been so sure of anything in your life as in your ability to bend everyone to your will. You will call anyone out and cut off their head if they show any sign of taking you on or backing down. You cannot be saddled with tedious underlings, but if one of your lieutenants shows an overly developed sense of ambition he may find more suitable accommodations in Davy Jones' locker. That is, of course, IF you notice him. You tend to be self absorbed - a weakness that may keep you from seeing enemies where they are and imagining them where they are not.    urlLink   What's Yer Inner Pirate?     brought to you by  urlLink The Official Talk Like A Pirate Web Site.

929,Gemini,"           Sometimes people find a character on a TV show or movie and sense something that reminds them of themselves. They may  identify with the rogueish nature of Han Solo, the charm of Ferris Beuller, or the desire for a middle aged man to dress up as an old lady like Mrs Doubtfire. More often then not, it's vanity talking. They may feel a kinship to the character, but it's more a desire to be like the character.  Sometimes however, one discovers a character they do identify with, and it terrifies them.  The more I watch the show, the more I'm convinced that I'm turning into him.  I'm becomming crotchety.  I'm becomming an annoying pain in the arse.  I'm finding a tendency to get angry and pissed off for no legitimate reason.  I'm Larry David.            "

932,Cancer,"       A question we all have asked ourselves after the break up.  Why did we give it our all?  Why didn't we see this coming?  Why didn't I try harder?  Love harder?  Or just do more for her?  Well I have a question right back to all of us.  Why the hell do we care.  After giving so much, monetary and emotionally.  We where taken for granted.  Used and tossed away.  Like yesterdays news.  They have the clean break while we are left holding our poor jaded hearts in our hands.  Sulking like little babies and feeling like eternal darkness has clouded our eyes.  It's all the fear of the unknown.  Ultimately, I feel it's the fear of never meeting that special someone.  The one that gives you those butterflys in the pit of your stomach when ever you think of her.  The uncontrollable smile when you think of them.  They way you plan a vacation just to make them happy, take them anywhere just too see them smile!  You know that contagiuos, light the whole world, make your heart skip a beat smile.  Attraction like that is far and few between.  Main people take it for granted.  But, butterfly don't last forever and seem to die as we get older.  We need to charish these times and try to make the relationships work. I have learnt this the hard way.  Even trying to save a drowning relationship.  Putting myself into debt to buy clothes, hair cuts, trips, etc.  Making the burn of the break-up scar me eternally and emotionally.  Developing a intense trust issue.  This maybe be more my fault...or not.  I'm gonna be the bigger human and say it was me.  We all have our faults.  But, the naive, look to the sky and believe in fate ideology tells us all that there is that specail someone out there for everyone.  The hardest part is finding her.  Fate has dealt us all with bad hands...IT'S UP TO US TO PLAY THE RIGHT CARDS.  sucks don't it!         "

I do love the rush of a deadline, and of course I usually don't have any cash to spend until the payday before Christmas anyway.    Here in our little slice of paradise, where I work, we get paid on every other Thursday.  I was thinking that since the Holiday was on Wednesday we would get paid on Tuesday.  Then, I was informed that payroll was being done one day early - so I figure that was to allow for payday on Tuesday.  Wrong!  Apparently, while I thought I was working for a nice person, I am in actuality working for Mr. Ebeneezer Scrooge.  Payday will be on Thursday, as usual.  The day AFTER Christmas. *sigh*  So, to date I have bought exactly one Clifford wristwatch and I have 'acquired' a Vanessa Carlton CD.

He's developed the software, designed the packaging, got the CD's pressed and packaged and got a distributor. He got his product listed on Amazon, but with a label of 'out of stock or discontinued on it.' All he needed was someone to make some phone calls and get a case sent to Ingram or some numbers entered in some inventory DB for the product to be listed as something people thought they could actually buy.   Whatever it was my buddy agonized for 1.5 yrs waiting for that final step to happen. I hope its not too late and that maybe some sort of relationship can be created between FrontPage and his product - one of those 'in addition to' recommendations on Amazon might do a lot to drive business.  Anyhow, I am happy for him and sad because the cavalry is arriving a little late. :-(  If you use FrontPage to any sort of web work at all, check out his products at  urlLink D2Stuff.com .

941,Taurus,"           Remember when the coups in Venezuela were 'big events' as little as a year ago?  Chavez (the socialist dictator) pretty much nationalized everything in the country, from media companies to oil production etc.  Well, in the process his cronies also murdered a whole bunch of civilians, and the US has been working behind the scenes since then to help prop the democratic leanings of the people.  This  urlLink referendum,   was a source of the most consternation on the part of Chavez - and now, looks like it's going to be carried out in the VERY near future.    Neat.  Too bad it's being overshadowed by *more pressing* issues   like Michael Moore's speeches at the DNC, the hysterics surrounding that event and whatever other  urlLink conspiracy theory  the hacks over at DU can come up with at the moment.

942,Capricorn,"           this post is my take on who is 'hot' and who is 'cooling off', based on performance over the last week or so.  in the fantasy game i play, players' prices fluctuate pretty closely with their performance, however, some do not (eg Roger Clemens' plummeting (sp?) price).  this is therefore not a barometer of who will make more $, just who has been playing above or below what they have done this season.  that said, here are my picks and their stats last week:  HOT: hitters:  J. Estrada C Atlanta: 8/17, 4 runs, 4 RBI, 4 2B, 1 HR, 4 BB, 2K   injured lineup not hurting Estrada, he has had a career  season  S. Casey 1B Cincinnati: 6/22, 4 runs, 3 RBI, 1 2B, 2 HR, 3K   NL avg. leader on a roll along with his team  JD Drew OF Atlanta: 7/17, 8 runs, 5 RBI, 2 HR, 6 BB, 2 K, 1 SB   injury-free season shows how good he can really be  K. Griffey OF Cincinnati: 8/19, 8 runs, 5 RBI, 4 HR, 6 BB, 3 K   see JD Drew  J. Dye OF Oakland: 7/25, 6 runs, 6 RBI 3 HR, 3 BB, 7 K, 1 SB   trying to prove that hot hot start was no fluke pitchers:  C. Carpenter SP StL: 6/2 7 IP, W, 9 K, 7 H, 3 ER                       6/7 8.1 IP, W, 6 K, 9 H, 3ER   7-1, 3.42 on the season, next start 6/12 at Texas. Cards have   had good run support all season.  low ERA and walk ratios; too   many hits may come back to haunt him though.  Danny Graves RP Cin: blown save 6/5 can't discount 26 saves   already.  the 3.27 ERA for a closer is a bit frightening.   he has 3 games v. Cle this week, and should be good for a save   or 2 in that series  E. Milton SP Phi: 5/30 7 IP, W, 8 K, 3 BB, 1 ER, 3 H                    6/4 7 IP, W, 5 K, 2 BB, 1 ER, 5 H   7-1, 3.78 season, next start 6/9 at ChiSox. only drawback is   that he only averages about 5.2 IP per start.  good control.  M. Prior SP ChC: 6/4 6 IP, ND, 8 K, 2 H, 0 ER   1st game back from rehab was stellar, wait until 6/9 start v.   StL to see if hes back for good.  F. Cordero RP Tex: 2-0, 18 S, 1.90 on season.  has 2 games v. Pit   coming up, then 3 v. StL.  he is ready for a breakthrough IMO.  A. Benitez RP Fla: 1-0, 22 S, .56 season.  has been the best RP   in baseball this season.  very consistent, gives up very few   walks and ER.  should be good for 50+ saves this year.  COOLING OFF: hitters:  Pittsburgh in general- 2-8 last 10 games, Mackowiak, Ward, and   Jack Wilson went a combined 15/81 last week, and 3 games v. Oak   this week don't look promising either.  P. Burrell Phi: 43 RBI on the season, only 1 in the last week as   he went 3/20 with 1 run and 5 K.  L. Overbay 1B Mil: avg is OK (6/16) but earlier power numbers are   way down (1 RBI, 0 HR last week).  3 games each v. Ana and Hou   w/ their pitching is not promising.  V. Guerrero OF Ana: 3 games does not make a slump, but beware.   after his 9 RBI game, he has gone 0-12 w/ 3 K in last 3 games. i   would still hold on to him for now, but keep an eye out. 3   games v.

943,Scorpio,"             I'm still wondering why I have so much to blog about this week... So happening! Well, anyway, I will never let anyone copy outside of my presence again. Yes... If you haven't already inferred, someone got caught copying my work. &nbsp; The worst thing about it all was that the person that caught the copycat was the Maths Dean. Anyone in 3.16 would know that the maths dean can be one hell of a bitch. Oh yes... Did I mention that she was a close friend of my mother's? Well I was relieved when my maths teacher told me I was 'almost' called up, which meant that I wasn't called up. But what happened was even worst. The Maths Dean made a personal call to my mom, telling her to 'keep a closer eye on him.' Oh... And you know what she told my mom? 'He was involved in a copying case.' Wow! That's specific enough... My mom actually thought I copied in my maths test, cause I was struggling with a question the day before. And I'll bet she'll get suspiscious should my results come out perfect. &nbsp; What a bitch... I really should get my maths teacher to clear this matter up. Call my mom then... Tell her that I'm getting my work copied instead of me copying... Now that will solve everything, cause she won't really care if I get As for everything while the rest of my class fails... HEHE!          "
944,Aquarius,"       I've discovered the following maxim: There's a fine line between sanity and instanity; all persons are either on that line or insane. Generalizing, I arrived at a 'super-maxim', by which other similar maxims can be derived, e.g.: There is a fine line between a moral person and an immoral person; all persons are either on that line or immoral. The super- or general maxim is: There is a fine line between [persons who are] X (virtue) and [persons who are] Y (opposite of X): all persons are either on that line or Y. Finally, I leave you with a couple of a couple of alternate wordings (and an ellipsis): The line between sanity and insanity is infinitely thin; I've never met a person who wasn't either crazy or hanging by a thread to that line.  There are two types of people in the world: crazy and borderline-crazy.  There are two types of people in the world: dead people and dying people.  Everybody I know is either dead or on their way.  ...  Moral of the story? Be thankful you're not on that thin-assed line because it's really a tightrope, and after you've finish falling you'll have a broken ass bone - in addition to being yet another high-strung fruitcake.

950,Aquarius,"                  The Tropical Adventures of the Fab Four Day #1   I started waking up at 6:30 this morning. I haven't done that since we moved here. We were both excited that Kurt & Michelle were arriving today. When you wake up earlier than the alarm there's always that mental conversation 'I'm awake, do I just get up, or can I ignore it and maybe doze for a little while?' I usually convince myself to doze and this morning was no exception.  We headed downtown and picked Kurt & Michelle up at the airport at 11:00 a.m. Ked headed inside to baggage claim while I stayed and guarded the car from those pesky airport security guys who think every unattended car is a security danger. I watched through the window as Kurt came down the escalator and saw Ked. The look on his face was pure joy and excitement and the brothers gave each other a hearty hug. I smiled and thanked God for the relationship they have and the time we get to spend together. They've both been like little boys all day long, chattering away, making other bodily noises - ahem!, and having a great time. Right now they're outside playing with their cameras in the sunset. (Kurt recently bought the same model that Ked has).  We loaded their stuff in the car and asked them what they would like to do. Since we were already half way to the beach we decided that would be a great way to start the trip! We grabbed some sandwiches at Subway and then headed to Ft DeSoto for a picnic and a few hours of sun and surf. It was an absoulutely gorgeous day, and perfect beach weather! The breeze was slight and the water was calm, clear, and blue. After lathering up with sunscreen we headed into the warm bath-like water with our snorkels to see what we could see. The find of the day was a giant, live sand dollar. He had to be 8 inches in diameter and a few inches thick. We all observed him on the ocean floor and then Kurt picked him up for a closer look. After we huddled around and oohed and aahed over God's creativity, we sent him back to his home. We found some other cool shells and Michelle and I spotted an unusual fish that looked like an eel with a long, needle nose. It was just a gorgeous day to be at the beach!  After a few hours we headed back to our place. After giving a quick tour of the apartment we headed down to the pool to rinse off the sand and saltwater. Ahhh, the life! I whipped up a nice dinner of corn on the cob, burgers, and coleslaw with strawberry shortcake for the dessert. And now I’m blogging, Michelle’s sleeping and the guys are out shooting pictures. It was a great day and the perfect way to start our trip. We’ll all sleep well tonight which is a good thing since tomorrow we are going to Disney World!!!                "

955,Aquarius,"                  I love it when a plan comes together!   Don't you love it when God answers a prayer right away? That doesn't always happen, because our timing isn't always His timing. But now and then our timings match up and when we whisper a 'please, God' Boom! We see the answer not much later. I love that about God. He's so big and awesome.  Ked's sister Karon has been looking forward to coming to visit with us in the sunshine for awhile. Plans here and there kept falling through and then a seemingly perfect plan for her to catch a ride with a cousin was all in place. It was going to work out great! Ked and I were a little bummed though because this particular plan meant we wouldn't get to see her as much as we would have liked, but nonetheless we knew how desperately she needed a vacation and we were excited to see her no matter how short it would be. She called us this morning and said now that plan had fallen through too and the cousin wasn't going to be able to come. We were all disappointed. She had already taken the time off work, and she needed to get away. Frankly, we needed the company too. All day long we all thought about it. We chatted again earlier this evening and she was checking for plane tickets online, but everything was so expensive and to get a good price she'd have to drive a few hours. I pulled out my laptop and whispered a 'please, God, you know how much she needs a vacation. Can you please help us to find an amazing price on a ticket?' I searched a few of my usual spots and nothing too great came up unless she was willing to drive over 2 hours to an airport.  So I called her again later and told her what I did find. In the meantime she was about ready to throw her computer out the window. She had found a good price and was willing to drive the couple hours. Just as she was going to book the ticket she got booted off the internet and had to restart. As she was rebooting I kept checking. I said 'hey, have you checked the Grand Rapids airport?' (only 45 minutes away). She replied that she hadn't even checked them because they are usually so much more expensive. Figuring we had nothing to lose I checked the flights from GR. 'Karon, you are NOT going to believe what I just found!!' I found tickets out of Grand Rapids for way less than anything else we had found today. When I told her the dates and the price she squealed, 'BOOK IT!! Here's the credit card number!!' That is just like God. She now has a better vacation planned than any of her previous options. The price was right, out of the most convenient airport, and she gets to spend more time here than any of her other options provided, thanks to the good flight schedules.  Thank you, God for listening to our heart's desires and knowing what we need. And thank You for Hotwire.com!!  Can't wait to see you Tuesday, sis!!!!               "
956,Sagittarius,"        Refreshing point of view  While at lunch today with someone slightly older and, perhaps wiser, than me, the issue of gay marriage flashed across the TV screen again.    He reminded me:  30 years ago, a black man couldn't use the same toilet as a white man.  It was considered 'fundamentally wrong', and segration was 'right'.    Less than 100 years ago, women couldn't vote in this country.  It was unheard of, and well, 'fundamentally wrong'.    Maybe 20 years from now, gay marriage will have moved into the realm of desegregation and suffrage.  Something that just had to be allowed, because how could it possibly be otherwise?  Diva out.           "
957,Scorpio,"       So I found the box in my closet with all of my stuff from World Youth Day in it.  I had forgotten how much that trip touched me.  On our way to Toronto, we stopped at the Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes, I met Sister Marguerite, who I spoke with for almost half an hour speaking with, and when I left she gave me the special blessing of Our Lady to carry to the youth from all over the world who I would be meeting with, who she said were the Torch-bearers, Our Lady's soldiers of love.  When we got to Toronto, we met our hosts, whose house we would be living in for a week.  Our hosts names were Gerry and Kath.  They had moved to Toronto from England, and they were the most loving people I have ever met in my entire life.  Everything we could possibly have needed they had for us, which included leaving pices of chocolate on our bed every day.  The first night of World Youth Day 300,000 people gathered, and we had Mass together.  I have never felt such great faith in one place.  And I rather doubt I ever will.  It was amazing to hear the Our Father said in so many different languages at once, It truly was beautiful.   Finally the day came when I got to see the pope.  I think it is impossible to describe the aura that surrounds him, or what its like to hear him speak, despite his Parkinsons...  We slept outside with the whole community on the last night, and woke up in the morning to celebrate Mass with the Holy Father.  He blessed us all as we left. When it was time to leave Toronto, Gerry traced the sign of the cross on our foreheads, and kissed both our cheeks, yet another  blessing that had been placed on.  I truly am so blessed. I couldn't even begin to list the miracles that have occured in my life. Thank you.     "

Over the time that I will be here I will hopefully post some of my experiences that I no doubt will happen as well as various thoughts, observations or whatever that comes into my head.

I have a 2 year contract with the Papua New Guinea University of Technology.  My position is with the Department of Open and Distance Learning, and what I will hopefully be doing is establishing Study Centre computer networks so students can use computers to do distance learning.

959,Scorpio,"       I need {want} so desperately to be loved. I can't get away from it.  I sit and watch sappy old black and white and sepia love story movies, and I know what that's like.  I know what they are acting {pretending} they feel, and I need that.  I need to feel the electricity flowing from fingertip to my body.  I am loved, I love, but it isn't like that...  This love turns the very core of my being to pure liquid terror.  The fingertips that touch send tremors of fear through me.  I don't understand how I am to cope with this.  I do understand much too much else.  I miss you. I wish you were never born.    "

965,Leo,"                 I'm getting good at this posting every other day thing.  Maybe someday I'll graduate to every day.  Probably not.  We took a practice exam today in our Academic Skills Workshop.  It was a Criminal Law Hypo (from our actual professor) that had a ton of issues in it.  Rape, murder/manslaughter/negligent homicide, transferred intent, larceny/burglary/robbery, conspiracy, and more.  All in one hypo.  The difference between this exam and the real one is that we got to use our notes--the real exam is closed book.    Listening to everyone's reactions afterwards was quite entertaining.  Some people looked like they wanted to cry.  Others were comparing their answers to their neigbors.  One guy said he wanted to go get hammered.  Personally, I wanted to go to the library and not leave for the next three weeks.  Just put the dogs in a kennel, forward my mail, and bring a blanket--live, eat, sleep, and study in the library.  And this is coming from someone who spends hours a day studying.  I can't imagine how the people who don't feel.  I think that the general consensus is that we have a LOT to learn in not a lot of time.  It was definitely an eye-opener.  It also made me realize that I spend too much time worrying about being prepared for class.  What was important for this exam was not the holding of the Brown case or the facts of the Sherry case, but the substantive law--the rules, elements, etc.  Sure, it's nice to throw in a case reference, but you don't have to memorize every line from every case.  I need to get over this fear of being called on so I can get on with my exam preparation.  We'll see if that happens.               "
966,Aquarius,"                  Singin in the Rain!   It's been a busy couple of days! I was commenting to Ked on Wednesday night how sometimes I feel like I live in Florida, but I don't live in Florida. How's that for confusing?? What I  mean is day in and day out 99% of the people I communicate with are in Ohio and Michigan. It's a wonderful thing that technology enables me to stay in touch with our family, friends, and clients back north. But sometimes I feel like I don't have much of a life here in Florida other than on Thursdays and Sundays.  As if in a direct answer to my discussion on Wednesday night, Thursday was awesome. I had my ladies Bible study in the morning. I had missed two weeks and didn't realize how much I had missed it until we were worshipping together. After Bible study I was invited to a lunch meeting to help plan some upcoming women's events for the church. I was sitting around the table with some incredible, Godly women and I just breathed a prayer of thanks. I felt so connected and so in Florida.  Speaking of the great women around that table, one is the wife of one of our pastors and I just love being around her, because every time she opens her mouth unbelievable wisdom comes out. She and her husband are the elders's elders, not just because of their age, but because they have so much experience, grace, and wisdom. I hope when I'm her age that I'm as graceful and wise as she is. In the few times I've been around her I've gleaned so much just by listening to her.   After Bible study and the meeting I came home and whipped up a salad for our Life Group social. We had a great time hanging out at a potluck at one couple's apartment. We call ourselves the 'junk food' lifegroup because every week have some form of chocolate, pizza, chips, or candy (some weeks all of the above!). We're not too big on the fruits and vegetables - although last night we did have my salad and a veggie tray, along with two forms of brownies and a bowl of Skittles. Actually, I think everyone eats pretty well the rest of the week and we all just decided that Thursdays nights is the time to cut loose, or something! We have two new couples in the group and it was great to get to know them better. We played several rounds of 'catch phrase' and just had a blast.  Today I took Ked into work and did some serious shopping. I had a $10 coupon to Famous Footwear that was about to expire, and I decided to use it to buy shoes for Shelley's wedding. I like shoe shopping; it's so much fun to try on new shoes and imagine what they'll look like with various outfits. Anyway, I found the perfect pair for the wedding - they are cute and comfortable! Such an unlikely match! After the victory there I headed to Target and scored a couple cool T-shirts for $4 each. Gotta love that! Then I headed to JoAnn's to use my 40% off coupon to pick up a scrapbook to put all my pages in I've been finishing lately. The funny thing is I actually had a dream about JoAnn's last night. I was in the store with someone (I don't remember who) and I was droning on and on about how awesome it was to have a JoAnn's etc. in town and how sweet it is that JoAnn's now has their own line of scrapbook products. What a nerd, I even dream about JoAnn's! That's scary. Anyway, I made it home with everything on the list and didn't pay full retail price for a single item! That's a good day.  Then tonight Ked and I had another great Tampa experience. I discovered that the city has a free Friday concert series through the end of May in a city park. I packed a dinner and surprised Ked with the news when I picked him up. We got this really cool picnic set for Christmas from Aunt Nancy and Uncle Alan, and we put it to good use tonight. We arrived at the park at 5:30 and set up our picnic table with the table cloth and had a great relaxing dinner together enjoying the music that was playing while the crews set up. We put our dinner stuff back in the car and Ked grabbed a book and I grabbed a newspaper (vital to the upcoming story) and we sat in our camp chairs waiting for the concert to start. The crowd started to gather and so did the rain clouds overhead. There were two local bands on the lineup tonight - Blues and light rock 60's era style. The first band was a lot of fun. I love watching the little boys and the little old ladies in the audience get their groove on. The rest of us can only hope to be as cool as them. About a half hour into the concert, the clouds started to spit on us. We all thought for sure it would blow over and the band kept playing. Most people whipped out their umbrellas, and I put the newspaper on my head because SOMEONE left our cool big umbrella at work! =) After about ten minutes it started to downpour and they called the concert off. Half the fun really was getting rained out and drenched as we raced to our car. We were laughing and giggling the whole way home. It was such a fun evening and so much better than sitting at home or in a movie theater. They announced that they'll bring these two bands back in early June. We think we'll check them out again then.               "

In addition to being shown around the city and a side trip to beautiful Toledo, I got to see both Jim and Emmanuelle's studios and I am now a proud owner of a Jim Kendall painting (a long-time dream come true).  Unfortunately, Lars couldn't come with me (he had to work), the only thing missing while having a wonderful time with good friends.   urlLink            "
974,Scorpio,"       {This is the last one.  This is the real reason I'm afraid I'll never have the courage to have kids.} 'When my mother first told me she was pregnant, she added, 'At last! We really are going to fill this house up with children.'  At first I didn't like the idea.  What was wrong with just having me?  My mother, father, and I were our own little unit. As the baby grew inside her, my mother let me listen to its heartbeat and feel it kicking against her, and I started looking forward to seeing this baby.  I hoped it would be a girl, and I would have a little sister.  Together my father, my mother and I decorated the nursery.  WE painted it sparkling white and hung yellow curtains.  My father stripped an old dresser and repainted it.  People gave us the tiniest baby clothes.  We washed and folded each shirt, each jumpsuit, each sleeper.  We bought fresh new cloth diapers because my mother liked to see diapers hanging on the line outside. The one thing we could not settle on was a name.  Nothing seemed quite right.  Nothing was perfect enough for this baby.  My father seemed more worried about this than my mother.  'Something will come to us,' my mother said.'The perfect name will arrive in the air one day.'  Three weeks before the baby was due, it came.  I heard my father telephoning the doctor.  'She won't make it,' he said. 'Its happening, right now.' I walked down the hall.  My mother was sunk into the pillow sweating, and groaning.  'Something's wrong,' she said to my father.  She saw mestanding there and said, 'You shouldn't watch.  I don't think I'm very good at this.'  In the hallway outside her room, I lowered my self to the floor.  The doctor came.  My mother screamed just one, one long, mournful wail, and then it was quiet.  When the doctor carried the baby out of the room, I asked to see it.  It had a pale bluish tinge and there were marks on its neck where the umbilical chord had strangled it.  'It might have been dead for hours,' the doctor told my father.  'I just can't say exactly.' 'Was it a boy or a girl?' I asked. The doctor whispered his answer, 'A girl.'  My father looked shaken, but he didn't seem concerned about the baby anymore.  He kept going in and touching my mother.  I went into my mother's room and crawled up on the bed beside her.  She was staring at the ceiling.  'Let me hold it,' she said. 'Hold what?' 'The baby,' she said.  Her voice sounded odd and silly.  My father came in and she asked him for the baby.  He leaned down and said, 'I wish- I wish-' 'The baby,' she said. 'It didn't make it,' he said. 'I'll hold the baby,' she said. 'It didn't make it,' he repeated. 'It can't be dead,' she said, in that same singsong voice.  'It was alive just a minute ago.'     "
975,Libra,"       -Sigh- I have no clue what is going to happen. You know, I thought I was at a perfect situation. I had plenty of people that I hung out with, I had very good grades, hell, I even made it on the honor roll with a 3.9 gpa. I ran in track, and each time I ran, I got better. What could be better? Honestly. But now, I don't know. I hate where I live, the people I've hung out with don't want to hang out with me, nor talk to me. My grades in some of my classes are starting to slip because I've been doing so much, I haven't the time to study and do all my homework. It seems as though all that has ment anything to me, is just slipping away. And, of coarse it had to happen right before summer vacation. Why?. This always happens. Can't I be happy? For more than a 8 or 9 month amount of time? Seriously.  I just don't know anymore. I don't know anything.  I need to go listen to more of The Early November.

Worth reading (re: the article)  urlLink Hatreds Kingdom  - by Dore Gold  'In recent decades, Wahhabi clerics have preached two forms of jihad against the West: terrorism, and financial jihad, whereby wealthy Saudi philanthropists subsidise terrorist groups under the guise of promoting Islamic causes.'

Post-Ba'athist Iraq offers similar geopolitical advantages and oil reserves, without the drawback of tying Washington's hands.'

982,Capricorn,"                 Yes, I have more to say. I guess I have blogging fever today. Anyway, my point this time is that if kids were encouraged to interact more with adults they’d behave more like them. Sometimes it seems as if adults avoid teens and teens avoid adults. Really. I don’t know why. Personally, I’ve never classified myself as a teenager. By my age, yes. But by my behavior, I certainly hope not. When I turned 13 I was very strict with my parents about them not calling me a teenager. I always enjoy conversation with adults. Though, I rarely have good conversation with adults outside of my family. The idea of the 21st century teen has affected the way adults view teens. Even the exceptions.  Most unfortunately .       "
983,Scorpio,"       Are you gonna live your life wonderin' standing in the back lookin' around? Are you gonna waste your time thinkin' how you've grown up or how you missed out? Things are never gonna be the way you want. Where's it gonna get you acting serious? Things are never gonna be quite what you want. Or even at 25, you gotta start sometime. I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go. Now all I need is just to hear a song I know. I wanna always feel like part of this was mine. I wanna fall in love tonight. Are you gonna live your life standing in the back looking around? Are you gonna waste your time? Gotta make a move or you'll miss out. Someone's gonna ask you what it's all about. Stick around nostalgia won't let you down. Someone's gonna ask you what it's all about. Whatcha gonna have to say for yourself? I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go. Now all I need is just to hear a song I know. I wanna always feel like part of this was mine. I wanna fall in love tonight. Crimson and clover, over and over. Crimson and clover, over and over. Our house in the middle of the street, why did we ever meet? Started my rock 'n roll fantasy. Don't don't, don't let's start, why did we ever part? Kick start my rock 'n rollen heart. I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go. So come on Davey, sing me somethin' that I know. I wanna always feel like part of this was mine. I wanna fall in love tonight. Here tonight. I wanna always feel like part of this was mine I wanna fall in love tonight.    So apparently this is the song of the week.  It's been stuck in my head since Saturday, and it keeps popping up places.  It seems to shove everything that I've been trying to ignore since June or so back in my face.   Are you gonna waste your time thinkin' how you've grown up or how you missed out?  and I can't pretend that nothing ever happened anymore.  Everything that happened with Andrew is over, I have no regrets for being with him as long as I was, and I have no regrets about leaving him when I did.  But a heart that has been shredded to pieces and scattered to the ends of the earth is not easily healed.  Stick around nostalgia won't let you down.  I am so happy where I am now, all the pieces fit together, I no longer have a stone around my neck...  But I still have that thought in the back of mind, that once, I did have that stone around my neck, and I know how very easy it would be to get it back.   I wanna fall in love tonight.   Sean means the world to me, and we have so much fun together, I wouldn't want to give that up for anything.  but I'm so desperately afraid, and I can't even imagine Sean putting me through some of the things that happened before, and I really do trust him... but my heart is scarred, and the walls that I thought had been broken down before almost seem stronger than ever.  I want to believe they're not, I want to believe that I have learned what a beautiful thing love can be... but I'm afraid to test it.  I don't want to question anything.  I want to accept things at face value, and believe that beauty {in this form called love anyway} is only skin deep.  BUT I KNOW BETTER.  Gotta make a move or you'll miss out. Someone's gonna ask you what it's all about.  I know that nothing can stay the same forever, people change and evolve...  Chantele's figuring that out right now.  I know that I'm not going to stay the same and things will change.  I have to take charge of my life, and stop this...  I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go. So come on Davey, sing me somethin' that I know. I wanna always feel like part of this was mine. I wanna fall in love tonight. Here tonight. I wanna always feel like part of this was mine I wanna fall in love tonight.    so perhaps we'll see...     "

985,Pisces,"       “No one is happy relatively - for a longer or shorter time. You’re happy or you’re not. That’s all. And death has nothing to do with it - death is an accident of happiness, in that case.” - Albert Camus   The above quote was pulled from Mr. Camus first novel 'A Happy Death' and to me, it says alot. It corellates well with my 'death is just another stage of life' philosophy. Camus recognizes that death is inevitable and should'nt factor in to your hapines. In other words, one should not worry about death. I wrote alot more on the subject, but I thought it sounded stupid so I deleted it (not that I don't recognize how stupid this post sounds anyway, atleast there's a good quote). Just haven't really had anything inspired to say since i've been writting this limitations piece, it seems to be taking up the wole good half of my brain.       Alas, enjoy Mr. Camus, and go read all of his books (which i will hencefourth rank in ascending order of goodness):       1. The First Man (a controversial choice, due to its lesser noteriety, but my favorite nonetheless).    2. The Stranger (His most critically acclaimed book, a book which neithr I, nor the man who works the counter at Barnes and Noble could figure out).    3. The Plague (Rusty's favorite, think Nazis).    4. A Happy Death (his First Novel, genuienly bizare, many consider it his precursor to The Stranger   5. The Fall (Still a Great book, just without the certain flair that characterizes his other works)   6. All of his other books which I have't read (The Rebel, The myth of the Sissyphus, Calligula and three other plays, I think he wrote some essays which have been published too, and his notebooks have been published, though i'm not sure if they've been published in English)      To summarize my thoughts on Camus, I shall say that he was 'simply the best' and its a horrible shame that he died before being able to grace us with more of his genious.

986,Aries,           ain't nothing going to break my stride.         
987,Gemini,"           .....or the continuing saga of the morning commute.....  Today we find our hero, The Highwayman, cruising along at his customary 10 mph above the speed limit, cruise control locked on, when suddenly he spots an obstruction in the path ahead. As he approaches the obstruction he starts to realize it is one of the many arch enemies of the highway, rolling roadblock guy! There he is, cruising in the fast lane going his usual 5 mph below the speed limit. With his customary calm, cool demeanor our hero uses his turn signal and attempts to enter the right lane to blow past the evil rolling roadblock guy, but alas, the enemy has anticipated his move and at the last second he quickly switches lanes, barely ahead of the Highwayman. With a bit less of his customary calm, cool demeanor, Highwayman quickly swerves back into the left lane and proceeds on his merry way.  A very short time later our hero notices something odd. In his peripheral vision, he can see the evil rolling roadblock guy easing his way ahead in the right lane. Glancing quickly over he sees the error of his earlier assessment, this is not rolling roadblock guy. It is actually Speed Racer reincarnated, driving his super-duper Kia sedan. (The coffee hasn't kicked his brain into gear yet. This explains our hero's error.)  Lesser drivers would be filled with fear and frustration at this development, but not the Highwayman. He's just confused as to where this Speed Racer guy has gotten his driving credentials. He knows his cruise control is locked on and functioning at maximum efficiency, so he simply proceeds on, straight ahead, steady course. This seems to aggravate Speed Racer, as he begins a routine of speeding ahead then slowing down and falling behind, seemingly in an attempt to block the Highwayman from moving back into the right lane. Strange tactics, to be sure.  Seeing his exit on the horizon, the Highwayman takes advantage of a momentary lapse by his enemy and makes his way into the right lane to exit. The feat accomplished, he begins to exit the highway. As he does so, Speed Racer passes by with a look of utter disappointment in his eyes. He has failed to thwart the Highwayman's successful commute.  Once again our hero has survived the morning commute. Once again he has vanquished another evil highway fiend. (See the previous 'Morning Commute' post.) Tune in again next week for the continuing saga of the morning commute to find out what evil the Highwayman will face next.          "

992,Libra,"                 by the weekend passing of the greatest president in our country's recent history.  President Ronald Reagan was a great American, and I am sad to hear of his death.  It seems hard to believe that it had been 10 years since he announced that he was suffering from Alzheimer's.  He had been so much out of the public eye that it was easy to forget that, I guess.  I can only think of one thing that I wish Ronnie hadn't done, and that is the deregulation of the broadcast industry.  That has resulted in all the bland, cookie cutter, sucky radio you hear across the country.  Kinda scared me that Ronnie thought a nuclear war was winnable, but you know what?  If Ronnie had been president, Afghanistan would have been nuked, and I'm not sure that would have been a bad thing...             "

My biggest complaint is the fact that because they expanded on the Battle of Helm's Deep greatly (1/3 of the movie revolves around it - where it was one chapter out of about 12 in the first half of the book) and that they added the romance between Aragorn and Arwen plus a skirmish between the Rohan and Warg riding Goblins, they really only got through about 2/3 of the book.  Given the amount of fighting left to be shown in Return of the King, you can see that they will cut out several parts of the story.  Because of some of the modifications already seen, it does not appear that Aragorn will take the Path of Dead and bring the naval fleet up to break the siege.  They will also probably not address what becomes of Saruman and what happens to the Shire.  The greatly enhanced roles of Merry and Pippin (with Rohan and Gondor) do not appear to be occuring either.  Who will kill the Witch King?  I also think the tried to hard to set up the sequel.  The emphasis on Gollum's discussion of 'she' in regards to getting the Ring are totally transparent to those who have read the books, but not really sold well if you have not.All said and done, I enjoyed the movie, and intend to see it again (hopefully with Mr. Haley when he is back among the living), but am disappointed with the lack of trueness compared to FotR.  BTW, New Zealand is indeed a beautiful country.  I never would have thought they had the terrain and vistas they do.         "
999,Aquarius,"                   A Day in the Life of Best Friends    I can't believe after 6 1/2 years of marriage how much fun Ked and I still have together. It was a fun lazy day. As we skipped arm in arm through the grocery store tonight, I commented to Ked about how much fun we have together. He responded 'We've been best friends for almost ten years!' Wow.   This afternoon we took a walk to enjoy the sunshine and then sat by the pool for awhile. (Just had to mention that for all our ohioans and michiganders. We love you!) We dipped our toes in the water, but chose not to get in. The heated pool was closed for repairs, and although we're still Northerners at heart, the unheated pool was just too cold for us! These lazy days together are what make life so enjoyable, just enjoying each other's presence and laughing together.   Later, we hit the town in search of some new shoes for Ked. We found the most amazing discovery since we moved here - MJM Designer Shoes - a.k.a. Shoe Heaven!! With unbelievable prices on brand name shoes, Ked had a hard time choosing, and I had a hard time resisting! We petted the nice leather Kenneth Coles and oohed and ahhed over others. It's not only shoe heaven, but sale heaven! Just walking down the aisles and aisles of shoes marked retail for $109 and on sale for $39.99 produced enough endorphins to count for hours of working out! Vowing to return, we were quite proud of ourselves that we walked out with only what we walked in for!   On the way home we swung by Hollywood Video for their $9.99 package of 2 rentals, 2 popcorns, 1 candy and one soda. After paying $8 a pop for a movie ticket a couple weeks ago, we decided that snuggling on the couch munching popcorn through two movies was not only more comfortable, but better bang for the buck. We'll save the big screen prices for must-see experiences.  Ahhh....I love Saturdays!               "

1003,Aquarius,"             I think if I'm going to claim 여의도/Yeouido as my new hometown I should know something about it...and by extension you should too. I've got a little more to add to my  urlLink background on it thus far .  As you may know, ~do can mean two things in Korean. One is: province, such as 경기도/Kyunggi-do. The other is island, such as 제주도/Jeju-do (also spelled Cheju-do, depending on what era the map or publication was edited in...things changed in 2002, just in time to confuse the heck out of tourists coming here for the World Cup). Since Yeouido (also spelled Youido, Yoido and Yeoido) is pretty tiny and part of 영등포구/Youngdeungpo-ku (ku is like a ward or borough such as Queen's or The Bronx) the ~do here signifies that it's an island. I had no idea that its ~do was 'island' because it looks as though they've filled in or paved over much of the water that once separated Yeouido from the mainland.  Anyways, way back when Yeouido used to be on the outskirts of Seoul and it housed the countries first real airport. (Later  urlLink Gimpo/Kimpo Airport  was built in the new outskirts of Seoul and now, since the city is not getting any smaller,  urlLink Incheon Airport  is the new International airport for Seoul; although Kimpo still handles much of the domestic traffic.) In fact,  urlLink Yeouido Park , which until 1996 or so was a slab of pavement instead of the picturesque park that it is, was the runway of that airport! So, here in West Yeouido, near the park, is where the streets are named 양말산/Yang-mal-san or 'sock mountain'. I got to thinking why it would be called sock mountain...there wasn't a sock factory here to my knowledge and I hadn't heard a story about removing one's socks for any reason (although I wouldn't dismiss it if I heard it; there are so many different traditions here). When I heard about the airport I came up with this theory: sock mountain is the hill (here they call a mountain what we in Vancouver would call a knoll, I find) where  urlLink the windsock  was placed. Make sense?  For more exciting and ground-breaking news stay tuned to this blog.          "

1006,Aquarius,"                   urlLink )'  title='Comments by SquawkBox.tv'> javascript:SquawkBoxCount( )    Negativity-where does it get you? I dunno-but what if it is really the reality? Seriously-being positive only makes me dream and hope for more and so when I don't get it-all I get is greater dissappointment. I don't want that. But I don't wan this life I have now either. I want to be happy. I want to be normal.-Whatever the hell that is.  I have realized I need to move away now more than ever. The only reason I don't cut here is because I'm in the 'good girl' role- that I've always been in. I hate it, I loathe it. It consumes me.   Darian has been cranky lately, Why I ask? I think because of my moods. I think she feels what I feel - just like I empathize with others.   I hate my fantasies of the future. How can they ever come true? They can't because I don't deserve happiness. Do I believe this is true? For the most part. Well I will continue this when I get home, if I make it. (NOTE: I orginally wrote this in my journal at home, and am retyping it, as I will do with other entries from my DAY/NIGHT journal) Well, I am home-Unfortunately my grandma is still awake. All I thought about on the way home is how my life is a sham and how me nor anyone  else knows how things will turn out in the future. I also really want to talk to C. Now I'm thinking oh, yeah, I should break it off with him. Before I give him a chance to bring pain in my life. Who knows that he will or won't though.   THere is no God. SO.. I guess I'll never find out. Life & everything in it is a sham, it is not reality.I don't understand how I can be so intelligent and dumb at the same time. I have coping skills and i chose not to use them tonite, so I feel like shit. Least it is a real feeling and I'm not pretending my life is a dream world anymore.I plan on taking the risperadol I found along with my tother meds and see if that helps anyway. Can't hurt. I don't have enough for that sort of thing. My negative thinking again. I  I just dont' get life, and why my family is so fucked up. A. has to have everything her way and it's just easier to give in to her. Hell she's had 18 years of training. 18 years of being in charge. ANd i let her, just as my parents die. What do I do though? I can't make her change.How do I cope with her?  I'm so confused in my life. I don't know how to fix it. I feel broken. I feel lost and hurt. I feel scared. I don't know how to feel any different. I don't know how to feel happy and be realistic at the same time. How? I wish I did. I wish to learn that someday.   I'm so scared that C. and I won't work out. Seriously am I being realistic, I mean I'm in love and engaged to a man I've never met. It's strange, yes. Everyone is negatie about it though. I just really don't see the difference between this and arranged marriages. I mean they don't even meet their husbands/wifes until they are married or shortly before. I am very commited and C and I were friends before we wanted to date. We want some of the same things- a better education, a family, someone to hold, and love and share with. We both share a disbelief in God. For once, I found someone who is like me and just doesn't believe because everyone else does. We like the same music. Both like the internet. of course. :) I just don't know where I should go with this. I mean. Well. If I break up with him, I'm feel like I'm running away, I'm pushing him away. I feel like I haven't given 'us' a chance. If I stay, I feel like, I'm not living in a real world. What do I do? Where do I go from here. It's scary, its' unreal.   I wish I could just move- and go somewhere far away. Away from here, away from the mess that I've created of my life. I want to be held. I want to be loved. How do I heal myself without C.? I don't know. But I don't want to be completely dependant either. How do I find the in between, that my personality doesnt want me to? How do you become independantly dependant or how do you find the healthiness in being both?    I do not know, I do not care.  I do not want to go over there.  I do not want to stay here  either.  I do not want to become a believer.  I want to find out  who I am.  I want to find out if my life  is a sham.  I just want the truth to be seen.  I want to see the in between.                  "
1007,Pisces,"       ..................................................  Happy Birthday Grandma Marge  ..................................................  Depending on how you know me and what you know about me -- it's very likely that you'll know one of the following things:   1. I'm something of a social constructionist  2. I'm a bookworm  3. I'm a 'theater person'  4. I'm a debater  But the center -- the core -- of what makes each of these things true about me is this:   I love stories.  And further:   I believe that stories make people.  I believe that story-ing is the fundamental human process.   And I have to pay a great debt of gratitude to my Grandma Marge for this value.   I'm pretty sure she wouldn't call herself a social constructionist, but she's been telling stories for the last thirty three years, and given her skill, she's been doing it a lot longer.  She grew up on a farm in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, her family having descended from William Brewster from the Mayflower and more recently from Kaiser Wilhelm.  Half the stories she knows (and that's a 'half' based on the ethos of hyperbole) she learned by peering through the register in her bedroom floor and listening to the goings on below.    She had a lot of uncles who broke the heart of their mother and her mother alike, but the drama of their lives unfolding through the register made my grandma marge a keen observer of human nature and a natural relayer of human conflict, motivation and resolution.   I don't want to tell too many of her stories here, because she's still writing her own book of stories -- Through The Register.  She has an amazing authorial voice where she has an ability to condense a whole world of human action into a quick sentence.  Her stories are often told quickly, but there's always a hundred layers and nuances in each one.   But I do want to honor that its her birthday and i want to affirm that the stories she's passed on to me, feel as visceral and warm as the afghans, sweaters, & mittens she's made for me.  They feel like they constitute me.  And since this activity which combines: history and making and imagination and drama and performance and humor and tragedy -- is the one activity that i'm most devoted to in the world....  I wanted to tell you a little bit about her.  Peace~    "

1009,Virgo,"   Hey everyone,  This weekend we were very busy! And we've had a lot of help from our friends. Our neighbors, William and Marie, are very sweet to us and we're always doing something with them throughout the week. William works for a towing company and Marie is a stay at home wife. They live with William's mom, Ida, who is currently having chemo for her breast cancer. She's doing okay, and we've been to see her a few times at the hospital when she stays there. In any case, William and Jeff love to play Diablo 2 together and are constantly talking about the game. William came over on Friday afternoon and told Jeff he needed to move our car. Jeff was a little confused and William said we needed to move our car next to his tow truck so he can fix our flat tire. Yes, our tire was flat! We knew that we had a screw in the tire, but we hadn't gotten around to fixing it yet. Turns out there was a slow leak and so our tire was slowly loosing air. So William popped out the screw, used his tire repair kit and we were all set to go. And William told us normally he'd charge 45 dollars for his services but for us, all he wants is Jeff to deck out his necromancer on Diablo 2. Which Jeff does happily!  Saturday Jeff and I wanted to put up our new chandelier in our stairwell. We've had this chandelier in a box in our living room for about 2 months waiting to get a ladder to hang it up with. Our old one was, well, old. One socket was broken and it was missing all of the glass cups around the light bulbs. The house was built in the 70's and I think that was the original chandelier. Needless to say, we needed a new one. So we got it and it sat in it's box forever. We asked around and my boss at work, Tammy, had a ladder. We just needed to go pick it up to use. Much better than buying one or renting one! So we decided to go down to Tammy's house and pick it up. We took Cinder with us because Tammy had been wanting to meet the puppy. She has a puppy too so we've been swapping stories at work.  We got to her house, and her puppy did not like Cinder, but Cinder was fascinated with Coco. Coco is a Chihuahua and Cinder is bigger than Coco and all Cinder wanted to do was play. But Coco would have none of that. We laughed a lot at them while we were cleaning off the ladder.  And then we tried to get the ladder into our car. We opened all the doors, the windows, put the seats down, everything. No such luck. We thought about tying it to the top of the car but that's a little dangerous. Tammy graciously offered to let us use her van for the day. So we loaded the ladder up, and drove back home.  Jeff got the chandelier up in about 2 hours. It looks fantastic. It's sort of a rustic look, blackened copper and clean lines, no flashiness. It has brightened up the stairwell a ton. In light and in style. It makes the house seem that much more put together. It's amazing what a nice light will do in the house!  After we dropped Tammy's car back off for her (no Cinder this time), we went to Tyson's Corner, a fantastic mall in our area, and bought Jeff new Sunday shoes. His old ones had split off from their soles and you could see his socks through the toes. So new shoes were needed! We found some nice ones at a shoe store in the mall. We also got some things that I needed for Primary on Sunday.  We also went to Target to get another light for our extra bedroom so when people come to stay, they have light in their room! We also got a few bathroom fixtures like a towel rack and a toilet paper roll. A very productive trip. :) We had dinner in a Mexican cafe right near there, and walked around the lake in the shopping area.  When we got home, Jeff put together the lamp and hung the bathroom fixtures while I played with the puppy. All in all, a busy and productive Saturday.  On Sunday, it was my Sunbeams' turn to teach sharing time, which means it was MY turn to teach sharing time. I was really nervous about it. Our theme for the month was 'How can I strengthen myself and my home through faith, repentance, and prayer?' So, I looked at the sharing time helps on  urlLink http://www.lds.org  and came up with one using the shield of faith and darts. See D&C 27: 15, 17. Jeff and I made 'fiery' darts from pipe cleaners and I taped them under a few chairs in primary. For every dart, I had something that could harm the faith in our houses or ourselves like 'You've just come home from church and your friend wants you to go to the movies with him. What should you do?' or 'You're really hungry and your mom is busy doing laundry. You want to eat lunch as soon as you can. What should you do?' That one got a lot of interesting responses. Ranging from 'make something yourself' to 'don't be so hungry!' In any case, Jeff made a shield out of a poster board and we wrote faith on it and had the kids who didn't have darts, come and hold the shield and respond to the problems. It was very cute and they had some really good answers. It went really well and I was pleased about that.  My Sunbeam class is growing in leaps and bounds! I started off with just 2 girls, and I now have 4 little girls (Shelby, 4, Kennan, 4, Katy, 3 and Hannah, 3) and a boy who is visiting for about a month (Zach, 4). They keep me on my toes. Their lesson this week was on I am thankful for my home. I was talking about a picture of a blossoming tree and they all piped up that it was the popcorn-popping tree! So we sang the song, and they proceeded to talk about what type of popcorn they had at their house. It was funny, but WAY off the topic. We got back to talking about who lives in trees and went from there. One thing that I introduced a few weeks ago as part of the lesson is selling Joseph into Egypt as a game. They each took turns being Joseph and everyone who was left were his brothers. I was the pharaoh, and the 'brothers' sold 'Joseph' to me and then came to ask for food. It was a very cute game and we have played it every Sunday for a month. Who knew it would be so popular.  We were able to play Diablo 2 with my dad as we do every Sunday. I think Dad and I died about 10 times. Good thing we're not hardcore players or we'd loose everything every time we died. We really look forward to playing every Sunday with Dad. :)  Sunday night we watched some of the Olympics that we had taped earlier. I've been following the swimming, and of course, the horses. We watched the stadium jumping finals and Germany won. USA came in 4th by like .2 points. I just enjoyed watching all the beautiful horses!  That's all for now! Check back frequently for updates! :) Love ya all, Catherine and Jeff   "

1013,Capricorn,"           so here it is, ladies and gentlemen.  the blog craze is becoming like as unto the atkins diet, exept that  a) blogging, to me, seems cooler than not eating bread b) see reason a.   beginning a blog now, i feel a bit like i felt when i began to read the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  even though my friends tried to convince me that they were great books, i didn't start reading them until about a month before fellowship came out.  so i was officially not as cool as everybody who read the books based on their own merit, but boy, am i glad i didn't let that stop me from reading them.    anyhow, i named my blog the bandwagon to sort of make fun of myself and my one-step-behind-everyone-else-ness.    what will i write about?  beats me.  i don't have a theme, unless ME is a theme.  oh well.  maybe i will talk about sam, the little baby sitting behind me in his chair.  maybe i will post a quote i like.  maybe i will put some pictures on here or talk about taking pictures or developing them in my almost darkroom ('almost' because it is neither completely dark, nor completely equipped yet).  maybe i will talk about your mom.  i dunno.  anyway, i will post something other than an introduction soon.    later, friends.  *elclang*              "

1020,Sagittarius,"       Last evening, was quite strange to say the least. I was supposed to visit the hospital for a checkup, but was informed that the concerned doctor was coming in late, so it would be postponed.  But then, to my shock, the doctor called my grandpa and informed him that he had sent some tablets for me to consume for a month,and that he would do the evaluation based on the results, after a month.  This seriously ticked me off, coz no one is telling me really where the problem is, and instead just making me pump in more and more tablets.  Now the numbers are upto 9 tablets a day!  I hate tablets, its quite a painful thing to swallow so many of them!  Got a call at 6:30pm, from an old friend of mine, Vinay now working at Mphasis BFL, HR guy, sweet fellow.  Had completely lost touch with him for over 2.5 years, and was pleasantly surprised by his call.  He had got my numbers from a common friend of ours, working at Wipro, was quite surprised that that guy actually had my numbers..hahaha...Spoke to him for about 15-20 minutes, about work, relationships,singlehood, parties, studies, was quite nice.  Then suddenly towards the end of the conversation, he was, 'Harini, there is a friend of my boss who wants to talk to you, have given him your numbers, and probably he will be catching up with you at 7pm, he's a really nice guy, so dont rip him up!'  I was quite confused over what he said, and asked him, 'hey, dude what are u upto? 'And his reply, 'your single and available right?'  I was like, 'huh? what do u mean by that', and all he said was,' be patient...talk to you tomorrow...adios !'  The next 10 minutes waiting for this guys' called made me a complete nervous wreck, was left wonder what the hell was going on.  Then, at the sharp stroke of 7pm, he gave me a call, interesting deep voice,must say.  This chat happend over 3 breaks really, 7 to 8:15, 8:30 to 9:10, and then 9:20 to 10:10pm.   The first phase of the chat was a very general one, where he gave me an insight into work he does, hes' a HR person too, but refused to tell me where he worked.  Just said, will tell you about that later.  I was like,hmm...okay fine.  Then had a chat about my work, bosses or shall I say the lack them completely, work related problems in HR, etc.  The second phase was mainly on a person level, about my hobbies, his love for expensive suits, and then  the movie  HUM TUM, had a 15 minutes discussion about that movie, was quite interesting...then had this chat about European markets, the lifestyle, did a comparision to the indian markets, was quite an intellectual discussion for a change!  Quite a funny thing in this was that he was trying to sell Blore as a great city to me, which was where he was, the bazaars, the best of the hangouts, cosmopolitian life, etc.  The third phase was where things suddenly change, he began to ask me questions about my sensitive areas, my relationships, belief in relationships, relations at work, my weaknesses, etc.  This is where I suddenly became acutely aware that the discussion was heading in a very different direction.  So, up went my antennas' and began to carefully answer each of the questions from there on.   It was kindof getting late too, and at about 10am, I kindof drew the confidence from god only knows where, and asked him, so why you interviewing me....? He then replied, ' hmm, smart girl, thought I'd be able to get most of the information out of you and then drop the bomb.  Was a pleasure having a nice intellectual discussion with someone after ages, and with someone as talented as you, was especially a lot of fun.'  I then was quite shocked, and said, ' okay, so which firm do you work at?'  And then came the big one, ' Oh, me, I work for IBM at Blore.  We just happen to be hunting for a HR person and Vinay kindof gave you a very strong recommendation. Was quite curious to know why he was strongly recommending you, so decided hey, lets give you a call and check you out.  Was kindof in a good mood, so decided to first get to know you and then try to gather inputs on you. '  I was absolutely taken aback, coz I didnt know whether to be angry for being put on a wild goose chase like this, or give vinay a call and scream my guts at him...or thank this guy for the opportunity!  Was an absolutely hilarious situation to be in!  Best part of the entire deal was that, I never mentioned to anyone that I was thinking of a change, coz I really aint at this moment, too many commitments at home to comply with...god only know where such things come and fall on my lap!  Anyway, finally I thanked him for a seriously interesting and different interview...hahaha..man, will never forget this.  I then gave vinay a call, spoke to him for about 20 minutes, had a good laugh over stuff...and asked then headed to bed with memories of a seriously different day in my life flying across my mind!

1023,Sagittarius,"        Other People's Children  Other people's children are never as cute as mine. Or as well-behaved.  Yesterday, the hotel was the site of a casting call for children.  The day started with cute toddlers tagging along behind young mothers with apparently no job to prevent them from hanging around our hotel lobby all day.  I'm thinking the kids are earning the paycheck in those families.  As the day progressed, the ages progressed, so that by 5pm there was a very noisy collection of children in ages ranging from 2 upward to about 10.  By this point, the bored children and likewise bored mothers were not paying attention to each other.  Kids running around the lobby to keep themselves occupied, mothers vying for preferential treatment from the casting directors.    Noisy chattering children, running around unattended.  My own kids can get on my nerves even in their best behavior.  These were not my kids.  If they were, I would've whacked 'em but good. *grin*  Diva out.         "
1024,Virgo,"       Ok so after i fought through the old mushrooms and mystery meat in crappy hot and sour soup, I faced another obsticle today, REALLY REALLY DUMB PEOPLE! ok so I was supposed to go to this 'mid school social' for the church, so its a pool party and games right, what could go wrong? well first problem is we couldn't find the place, after all it was in Coralles, so the instrutions were very un-clear, so we called them right, and guess what they said that we should go 'south' on largo loma so we went o say 5 miles down that road (south of couse) BUT failed to find the street they were talking about so we called them again and not realizing (even though we gave them the streets we were close to) they wanted to know the color of our car and model, so they could wave to us,(imagine how many people this idiot waved to) turns out we were about 5 miles from where we were supposed to be, now we had his wife on the phone, who we now know evidently din't know her cardial diretions and they said to go find alemeda, the closest big street near them, witch was actually NORTH! ok so we've wasted an hour now just trying to find the place so we finally come to the street they wanted us to, the directions said that we were supposed to look for the house with ballons out front, so we drive all the way up the street and no ballons, so we give them another ring (3rd time) and they say they're 3/4ths of a mile up the street so we go back to the start of the street to start recording our mileage and hey whadda know i see someone from my church sliding down the water slide, (we are at the BEGINING of the street) and we realize thats the party so we watch the place to see if my friends are they, convienintly none are and we decide to go back home without going to the party. moral of the story, always stop by the house (even though u spent an hour and a half searching for it) WHY??! u say? so u can find out what kind of people could be SO DUMB!! also i personally think there should be a national >75 IQ BLACKLIST! I'm sure they would quailify, and watch out for dumb people, they're all around you!         "

1027,Libra,"                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A LONG time ago. Like 2 days ago. There was this guy named johnreed. johnreed he was a character. hE WAS walking outside at 4:30 in the morning on MARION ave. which is a never-ending road! Well he was walking along the road when all of a sudden a guy in a pink and blue tractor-trailer pulled up beside him and blew a dart of poison into this neck. The man got out of his car and pulled john into the car and took him home. JOhn woke up 13 hours later with a horrible headache. The first thing he saw was the figure of a man wearing a purple suit.” who are you', john still dizzy asked. 'My name,MR. Rxxd, is Sam Kingostopper'. 'But U can call me Kingo, all my closest friends doo'!.John says, now getting jumpy, 'What am doing here'!!!!!! 'This has to be some shorta joke!' 'Where am I'? KINGO replys,'u are in the ghetto.' 'There are no ghettos'!,  JOHN REPLYS. 'That is a ignorant thing to say fool”, said KINGO. 'Stop playin word games with meee!'Says john. 'IM NOT PLAYIN WORD GAMES WITH YOU'. All of a sudden kingo forces john to lick a poisoness frog. john passes out and hits the floor.Kingo goes back to playing with his pet lobster, named bunny. john wakes up a day later, remmbering what had happened.O CRAPz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'MR. jOHNrEEd u have finally woken up, u had a very long and pleasent nappy-sleppy-sleppy.' john said,' cut to the case, why am i here.' 'its very simple,mr.reed, i kiddnapped you becasue i need your help',kingo says. 'Ok, I will help u just stopp druggin me, it isnt very nice', john reply. 'Alright, just stopp yellin and caring on like a crazy hamster under shock hearpy', relpys kingo. JOHn takes a deep breath and leans back in the chair. 'Ok lay it on me!' Kingo stepps back and sits down on the sofa,'ok i need u to brush Bunny's teeth'. 'WHAT??????', JOHN REPLYS. 'Who is Bunny and why do u wANt me to do that.'  Kingo looks a john and picks up bunny, 'bUNNY is the name of my losbter'.. 'oh ok phyco', repleys john. 'ok stop makin fun of me mr.reed, do u wanna lick the frog again??', replys kingo. 'O no, anything but that, i just dont understand, why cant u do it ur self?? 'very go qwestion, i have a allergy toward toothpaste, kingo says while crying. 'Stop that u look like a pansy',tells john reed. 'please mr.johnreed, (looks and hugs the lobster)bunny doesnt want to get a cavity, do u bunny??!!'. 'fine, after this will u let me go home, i have to watch the si-fi channel, there is a show without guns on tonighT', replys john. 'fair enough, or u could live there!', said kingo getting mighty excited,(jumping up and down like a little girl) ' we can sing NICK NACK PATTY WACK all day long.!!' NO no just let me do this and then take me home', john replys with wide eyes . KIngo hands the lobster to john and a small toothbrush just big enough for a lobster. it only take john about 5mins to brush the lobsters discolored teeth. 'done',says john. 'great job mr.johnreed', says kingo full of gratitude. 'I will take u home know but i must  drug u one more time. i dont want anyone finding out where i live!', kingo says while looking thorugh some boxes. all of a sudden the man takes out a vial of blue liquid, and shouts,'fair larwence lives on 4ever!!!' john looks up in dissbelief,'I will drink it, it is the only way to get away from this crazy insane man!!' john falls to the ground.  · 3 hours later john wakes up in the driveway of this home, dizzy. His dad is standing over him. Myron says,'i told u no drugs jon, this is very dissapointing.' .'but dad i didnt do drugs, i was kiddnapped.' 'i dont believe u, why would soemone kiddnapp u, thats why you are taking kun fu, so u dont get taken by anyone.' john stammers out,' but itys not kun fu'!! 'no i dont care what it is , get up stairs u are grounded for the next 3 weeks, and u are going to get spanked  100 times with a seat belt!!' 'great'. john returns to the kichen woundering weather he had dreamed the whole thing or if he really did meet the crazy man named kingo. 'o yeah by the why john,  meet the mayor of mansfield, he needs my help with  his job', says john dad, 'mr. kingostopper'. john turns white, kingos and johns eyes meet and john runs up to his room screaming and then gets into the fetal position and shakes. Back down stairs johns dad explains that john is on cyrstal meth and he screamed becasue that is how he says hello.' Kingo gives a chuckle a takes a sipp of tomato soup,'i dought that, he seemed like a very nice and useful young man'. 'whatever, so u need money, and i am a lown shark, so just tell me what u need'. All of a sudden Mryon is shot in the neck with a poisoness arrow by kingo, and he is dragged away. kingo says with a huge grin on his face,'THE MADDNESS WILL NEVER END,AWAWWWWWW'!!! **BEWARE**** **RED-RUMM** BY:DANIELLE C-2004-fishy isn’t it??

1030,Capricorn,"                 so lazy.  I'm such a lamer right now.  Have not hung out with Collective in EVER!!! they must save me from my substance-abusing ways.  *for shame*   anyways, I have also been neglecting my lists of late, so I shall resolve that conendrum now.   two days ago... i wore: my black sports tee, and scanty scanty denim shorts.  and white sandals. i ate: I think that info was stored in the brain cells I lost over that past three days. i did: a hell of a lot of being embarrassed, some more hanging out with Foo, and Kevin, some attempted sleeping-over at their place that was confounded by their suspicious suspicious mother (who has great taste in reading material!), and finally some more dope-smoking with Paddy.  thus resulting in more brain damage.  me+Paddy Barry=brain death. i liked: the fact that I was totally irresponisible the night before. i disliked: the fact that I was totally irresponisble the night before. brag moment: having a fifteen minute shower.  (seriously that's an impressive new time for me) cringe moment: I swear, all the cringe chi from the previous day maliciously saved itself for this day.  goddamn cringe chi. granola moment: spending all day in front of the computer. i planned to: not get high with Paddy that night, but look how THAT turned out!!!  yesterday... i wore: blue adidas shorts, and a black tee. slippers I believe for footwear. i ate: coffee, popcorn, and a LOT of water. i did: a whole lotta nothing.   slept the day away.  oh, and earned ten bucks for babysitting, even though I slept almost the whole time. i liked: sleeping i disliked: being disapproved on. brag moment: patting the sick baby back to sleep WHILE standing, AND sleeping!  bitch! cringe moment: the enormously huge fight with my sister that resulted in our current avoiding of each other.  it continued into today. granola moment: drinking coffee underneath the maple tree. i planned to: get up and be productive eventually, but failed miserably.  today... i wore: a housecoat ALL DAY LONG!!!  (I am Laze-bot.  Fear me.) i ate: coffee, and a casserole-like thing with noodles, and chicken. i did: some bouquet-making, some sleeping, some wishlist making, and a lot more fighting with my sister.  seriously considering taking Ahrodie, and my pictures, and becoming a hermit on Mt. Benson (note to self: stock up on shampoo).  that's teach them! i like: the idea of music.  (I have none of my own since the fire, and the Final Great Geoff Breakup) i dislike: being the crappiest person in the world. brag moment: my lovely lovely creation that is sitting on a table in the front hallway right now.  roses, cosmos, dahlias, and yarrow fronds.  I was proud. cringe moment: saying a couple things that were entirely cruel to Sherayna. granola moment: hanging out in my room in my housecoat and slippers.  hugging my teddy. i plan to: maybe go hang out with friends.  it'll take some serious motivation on my part however.  I seem to have lost some of that lately.  there, happy?  my unhappy unhappy last three days in organized list format.  my shoulder hurts.  off to blogsurf, now.       "

1033,Leo,"       on another issue all together....guilt...what about guilt....what place does it play in my life?....should all christians feel guilty after watching the passion....or after going to church on sunday morning....or just reading the bible.....is there such a thing as too much guilt....maybe.....maybe not.....I know that for a long time I had a lot of guilt about a lot of stuff and I prayed for God to help me with my problems...but it didn't seem like it helpled all too much...so is God not powerful enough to help me...or am I too weak to help myself....or a combination of both....I don't think guilt should lead to a loss of faith....thats a bad deal....  Of course we should feel guilty about watching our savior be crucified. He was there because of all of our sins, and our shortcomings in the eyes of God. I don't think a person should be a Christian just because they think Jesus was a decent guy and what happened to him sucked. I think there are a lot of decent people who got screwed over in life but I don't go on worshipping them. The guilt should be because he was who he was, not solely because of what happened to him.   Guilt shouldn't lead to a loss of faith, I think feeling guilty about sinning leads to more faith. Also, I'm not too sure that God answers all prayers as well as we'd like him to. Maybe not seeing the ideas he has for us is the main problem.  Also, everytime I think about guilt in that way I picture myself as one of the crazy fire and brimstone type preachers screaming 'Every time you sin you're saying that Jesus's death wasn't good enough for you!' then I giggle, I haven't sat down and put much thought to whether that is justifiable or not, I can just picture someone saying that and it makes me laugh, oh well...

1036,Sagittarius,"       So Today I was going to work for Vic at his accounting business, but because I'm a new kid...I'm not needed yet. I could be skiing tonight, but maybe I'll just lay in bed and pretend I'm a mole. I'll just cuddle deep into the blankets in a dark embrace consumed with the smell of warmth. True to a mole, I am blind when it comes to the world. I think when I just think I've figured something out, I'm tossed a hardball and I never quite comphrehend it once again. I feel like I'm so young looking at everything and I can't fully see the big picture.   What triggers this is my jealousy towards situations and people. Jealousy is not always a bad thing, actually it encourages friendly competation at times... but at others...it has a nasty streak of green which likes to flair up at certain times. Sometimes I feel jealous towards people because of what they have, or who they have. It's a natural reaction to something you want for the sake of wanting it.   I'm not sure...why I have these feelings sometimes. But! who really understands the female mind...or even the teenage brain. Sometimes I'm jealous of Martin and Kate, Jane and Paul because of the love they all seem to have for each other and everyone involved. I sit back sometimes and wish I could have someone in love with me as much as Martin is with Katie. I have alot of respect for these four people as I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart that I love them. I love them every much and maybe its because I see them in a non-judgemental way and in a positive manner that I compare myself to them. Thats one of the main problems of myself. I compare myself to others. I put myself up against others who have different strengths...and weaknesses.   For the longest time I compared myself to Dana, who was someone in my eyes who I just wanted to emulate. I wanted to be as smart and as talented as him. Did I ever stop to realize that I slowly was transforming myself and become less of me and more like him. I found some things along the way that I actually did enjoy. I really enjoy barenaked ladies, politics, acroynms, and assorted other stuff.   And time management...I joined Team Youth because I felt I should. I felt pressured into it and I'm losing interest very quickly. We never do anything...and well. At times I feel this is a pointless organization because what the fuck do we seem to be doing? I know I made a committment to the organization at the beginning of the year, but sometimes I just don't want to go and do anything. I want to lay at home and sleep and just be alone. I don't want to be around anyone. This means that I have to send fucking Kelly an email explaining my schedule. How do you explain that you just don't want to be part of anything because you want to be depressed and boring and lick all your wounds that lately have had salt pressed deep into them. How do you explain that you would rather sit home alone on a friday evening typing in your blog than interacting with people because you know if you interact with people there is tension, or theres a chance there could be a problem.  So I'm going to work tonight for Vic actually. Have to be there for 5pm. I'm washing my clothing...geezus. If I would have known then I wouldn't have washed it. I have to schedule some damn appointments tonight!   I just want to cry. I want to find something and hold tight. I'm rebounding.   In short, FUCK FUCK FUCK and FUCK!    "

1040,Sagittarius,"       I wonder, does it make me a bad person because I'm enjoying putting the squeeze on my dead-beat-dad ex-husband?  After 10 months of no payments in child support, we're finally going to court at the end of this month.  He now has less than 2 weeks to come up with the dough he owes me or he'll sit in jail until he pays me.  I've had 2 years of struggle - of wondering how I'll pay the rent and the day care and still manage to buy food for my two children.  In the meantime, he's living in his girlfriend's house, driving her car, sleeping in her bed and eating her food.  OK, so maybe I'm a little bitter about the whole thing.  Maybe after he married me he finally realized that SHE is his one true love and he couldn't bear to live a lie by being married to me.  Or maybe he just got in too deep and needed her to bail him out.  Well, now she may have to do just that - literally.  (Although I really hope it doesn't come to that - I would prefer getting paid.)  Does it make me a bad person?  I just want to get paid.  And see him squirm just a little.   As for my two wonderful little girls - I must say that I got the better end of this whole divorce deal.  I have the pleasure of the company of two of the most beautiful and charming little girls I've ever known.  Never mind they're my children, they are two exceptional human beings.  Every day I get more and more joy from knowing them and seeing them grow.  There is nothing more valuable to me than one of their hugs, or seeing their faces light up when I pick them up from school or grandma's house.  I know that, in spite of all the struggle and hassle and frustration that comes from being a single mom with less than adequate support from an absentee father, having them in my life makes my life worthwhile and fulfilled.

You know, its really cool to think about the millions/thousands of people you meet/see/walk past in your lifetime that all have this unseen force in them that gives them the ability to walk/think/gain intelligence etc.  I was babysitting this little two year old boy last night and he fell asleep on my shoulder, it was so cute, I love the feeling of having a sleeping child in my arms. I wonder if I'll ever end up having my own kids, creating life...  hmmm...    "

1044,Sagittarius,"        Monday, Monday  Today started with the unparalleled joy of changing a flat tire.  I did it in less than 15 minutes, and managed to keep my clothes free of dirt and yuck.  And, luckily the tire was flat when I got into the car this morning.  It didn't go last night when I was driving home in the rain, or this morning when I would have been cruising along on the highway at 65 or 70.    So, while it was a bit of an inconvenience, it wasn't too bad.  Otherwise, I had a great weekend.  I participated in Hands on Miami Day and painted the boardwalk a new coat of brown.  Me and 299 other volunteers.  In all, the event attracted 3000 volunteers, with several projects throughout Miami and Miami Beach.  I even saw a few familiar faces, along with my team of 6 other coworkers.   Got a haircut, did a little shopping, and relaxed a little with a Sunday afternoon nap. Pics are going up in the diva gallery of our trick or treat outing.  In all, a pretty good weekend.     Diva out.           "

1046,Sagittarius,"        Huge Success  The Wine Club event was wonderful.  I had about 89 guests show up, and most of them paid (12 comps out of 89 isn't too bad).  I just love it when lots of people show up for an event; I turn into this super-human social butterfly.  Shaking hands, smiling, welcoming everyone to the party ~ you'd think it was MY party.  And in a way it is.  I got to sample a really wonderful white wine from Spain last night - I carried my glassful around all night long, nursing it for over an hour.  I'm taking a bottle of it home tonight if there's any left.  I'm thinking a little sushi and a glass or two of the white wine will finish my week off quite nicely.    I even got to do a TV interview last night.  That's right, I've graduated from print to television.  I'm not quite sure how its going to turn out and I'm not sure I want to see it when it does air.  We'll see... that may be my limit on those 15 minutes of fame. ;)  Heading out for a very quiet weekend (I hope).  Have a fabulous weekend for me!  Diva out.           "
1047,Aquarius,"       I’m off to LA for fun in the sun with my best friend.  It’s the last of a girl’s romp before she (you guessed it) gets married.  I plan to do some touristy things and then just hang with my best gal pal.  I miss her and I’ll miss her even more when she gets hitched because girlfriends change ever so slightly when marriage happens.  I was hoping we’d hop over to Vegas for the weekend, but we’ve opted for time in LA with her fiancé.  Well, I love them both, loads and loads.  I’m excited to see them, either in a flashy city or just in their living room.  Have to say though, kinda wish I was going to see a booby show.  I’ll blog at ya next week.  Blogger back ya’ll.         "
1048,Aquarius,"             A readers will know, shopping in Seoul is a little different from back home (assuming back home is a Western country like Canada, the US, UK...).  For one thing ( urlLink more things here ), you can haggle at almost every 'store' (and some for sure at every place that is not a store, but like the picture below). This includes the 'department stores' like Migliore, Doota and Hello ampm that are in Dongdaemoon (each area actually stalls of independent sellers) but not such high class/price places like Shinsegae or Lotte Depart.  There is also no haggling at Lotte Mart, LG Mart nor E-Mart, but in those places you're getting a bit better surroundings than the true discount stores.  Anyways, I find that haggling is a bit of an art...and it takes a little while to get the hang of it.  After a while you'll wonder why you don't get a discount back home, though.  (There is also  urlLink no tax  on purchases; it's either included in the price or just not paid--especially at street-sellers.)  Like today, I went to Namdaemoon for some shopping, had to get a few undershirts and towels.  I found a seller of both and asked the prices: 2,200 won for a shirt, 1,700 won for a towel...no discount.  Huh, ya, right.  I offered 16,000 (compared to the 16,800 total price...this is NOT a big discount, just 5%, but I was in a hurry and didn't have 5 minutes to haggle for $1.50 off).  She said, 'no discount' again, but I said (in Korean) 'I'm buying 3 of these and 6 of these, discount!' and she relented.  Oh, it helps if you can do simple math in your head (the seller sure as heck can) and if you know enough Korean to at least  urlLink say the prices in Korean .  Otherwise you're a bit of a mark.  Now for this picture.  This 'store' popped up literally right on the street near my work and the sellers were luring the office girls to try on their lovely selection of shoes.  No guarantee, but for $10 a pair and the way fashion trends have the life of a gnat here who cares?   urlLink     Get your ladies shoes right here!            "
1049,Cancer,"       Tonight was a test of the emergency back-up system.  You failed miserably.  Had there been an actual emergency the police would have been on your doorstep.  When I call your house repeatedly and frantically and leave messages for you to call me NOW, I mean now.  I don't mean whenever you goddamned well get around to it.  Count your blessings that it turned out to be NOT an actual emergency.  This is your final warning.

1055,Taurus,"       Great job by David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez reppin' the Sox last night with 2 2 run HRs a piece in the AL's 9-4 romp over the NL.  A lot of people say they should of been co-MVPs, but Alfonso Soriano's 3 run shot really set a tone and put the game out of reach.  Plus, it was a HUGE blast over the rightfield wall in Houston.  I am so glad that guy doesn't play for the Yankees anymore......he's actually developed patience over the plate, which is scary.  Bud Selig wants the 'The winning league gets the home field in the World Series' thing renewed.  Of course he does, because he's stupid.  Not only does it devalue a win/loss record for the regular season, it also pins a square advantage to someone in a championship series via an EXHIBITION game!  That's like giving someone the White House just because he only won the state of Florida........  Going into Stage 10 today, Lance Armstrong is in real danger of losing the Tour de France for the first time in 5 years.  I've always found it ironic that in France's biggest race (a country known for surrendering and pissing on people), the leader and winner of the race gets a yellow shirt.  I don't know why everyone outside of the USA is in a tussle over Lance's alleged doping.  The guy had testicular cancer!  I think he's allowed to take steroids after getting a nut cut off!  If there's ANYTHING that critics should go after, it should be the fact that Lance has a huge speed advantage by being 2-3 lbs lighter for only having that one nut.  The critics sure dropped the  ball  on that one (ok, I'll stop).......  I hope Randy Johnson does come to the Red Sox, not only to help them win a World Series, but maybe he can put a huge dent into this over population of pidgeons we have in this city.  We used to have a big rat problem around here, but it got taken care of because those rats evoled and grew wings.  When you see 4 albino pidgeons having breakfast at *2* different Dunkin Donuts', they're fucking too much.  Pidgeons are the one of the many reason's the NRA could be a fun club to be in.  It would be like duck hunt, except the dog would be replaced with a cat.......armed with lasers.     Big series coming up in Anaheim this week.  And they need to win more than we do so they can look more attractive to the 'Big Unit'.  Speaking of being attractive to units, a sex video shot by a former husband of Baywatch blonde beauty Gena Lee Nolin (warning!  not work friendly! http://www.anothersite.co.uk/gena-lee-nolin.htm ) is out.  I was very impressed because it's her best acting performance she's had since.........wait, she could never act in the first place.  But she sure can play it up for the camera!  Now THERE'S talent!

1058,Capricorn,"           i have just had a revolutionary concept...every sunday i will give you my opinion on my personal top 5 somethings.  this is very tentative, and it is more than possible that this will be the only one.  with that in mind, the first category is...music albums!  these are all from the last 7 or so years, so there was never really consideration for any classic albums.  as you can see, most of these albums are from my favorite bands, which is no coincidence.  without further ado, here are my top 5...  5. a rush of blood to the head- coldplay    i got this cd last year, and i listened to it on my way to every golf match...its very calming, and i love every track from 1-7. 4. just be- tiesto    this is that new (to me at least) trance album i have been raving about.  the best song on it is by far the 1st track (forever today), which is probably in the top 5 songs (hint hint) for me.  who says the london club scene is weak?  i think he is the #1 dj in the world...heady stuff. 3. e-majn- cloud2ground    another incredible techno/trance album.  this is what got me addicted to the trance/indie thing.  the best 2 tracks are #1 (raindown) and #6 (face2face)- which is the most beautiful song i have heard (other than amazing grace on bagpipes and possibly lee greenwoods 'God bless the usa')  anyway, its an awesome album, except i dont really like the last 2 tracks.  the 1st 7 are incredible 2. the anatomy of the tongue in cheek- relient k    this is the most diverse album up here.  they always have a couple of goofy songs on their album, the difference here is that those songs are really sweet (im lion-o, may the horse be with you).  i also love the raw emotion in these words are not enough and for moments when i feel faint, and down in flames and failure to excommunicate are awesome as well.  the fact that this is not their most recent album yet it makes up about half their concert set says something about the strength of this album. 1. ok computer- radiohead    how do i love thee...let me count the ways...about 9, as in 9 of the best songs ever (actually track 7 doesnt really count, but its funny anyway).  3-5 kind of suck, but it seems that every compilation cd i make has at least 3 songs from this album.  the guitar solo in paranoid android is one of the best of the post-hendrix era imo, and electioneering is still my favorite songs even though it is about 7 years old.  karma police, airbag, and climb up the walls (the song that made me get...actually burn...this cd in the 1st place).  kid a and their newest one arent as good as this, but radiohead is still a remarkable band.  there you have it...edition 1 of my top 5.  if anyone has differing opinions (there should be no differing with this list) feel more than free to post a comment, i would love to hear from you (yes, you).

1059,Pisces,"         - vacation summary - retraction - reflection -    we spent the last week in michigan.  drove from canton at 6 p.m. last thursday, returned to casacommunitas at 12:30 this morning.   during the trip up, lynn and i had some deep - dark and some deep - light talks...i felt much closer to her.  seems like talking / conversation -- the value we share most deeply and that binds us most fiercely to each other -- is always priced at a premium these days ...   spent several days with dave and linda in south haven, mi. we hadn't been there before, but it seemed just about perfect.  the extended gibbs family has been singing its praises in several keys for several years and so finally their witness broke through and i accepted this particular unique salvation.   what was the shape of this grace?    free bikes from our inn, so meandering conversational bike rides, plenty of great food, 'committee meetings' galore, some hardcore sunburning on the shore of lake michigan, lots of rich dialogue about everything imaginable.   late one night, after my E self had pretty much vampired all the energy of the other three I's in the room....i proclaimed -- 'that's all there is in the world!  memories and relationships!'    it still seems like a worthwhile axiom, but later we discovered that i had left out essential things like eating and tables in that particular equation...  hung out for a long time with each of my brothers and parents by the pool at geborgenheit.  with david was provoked by the shocking revelation that he doesn't think about the future.  no five year plan.  no ten year plan.  no thoughts of legacy or coherence.  just honesty and genuineness *now*.  with daniel we debated pacifism and then the redemptive arc hermeneutic...  which brings me to the  retraction  -- turns out that LYNN is NOT a pacifist.  she's just clearly opposed to the war we've most recently engaged in and thinking really hard about the implications of a commitment to nonviolence.    resultant self discovery: turns out that i am more likely to EMBRACE *then* consider when it comes to new positions.  this may be a helpful rubric for those of you struggling to justify my earlier self descriptions as *liberal* and *pacifist*.  i chalk this up to my 1.) penchant for hyperbole, 2.) my empathic strain, 3.) my procilivity to think outloud (i think marcia gave me the term 'external processor'), & 4.) my tendency to want to think / be / perform outside of 'the box'. which, if you think about it, is kind of odd because this whole *embracing* thing just locks me into a new box...  sometime i'll devote a whole blog to how affixing our identities to the various discursive formations that surround us is always problematic and conflictual....but (big sigh of relief audience) not today.  have i fulfilled the promises of my title?  can i end for the day?    i do want to offer a shout out to John who is a new blogger and has a goshdarn deep  urlLink blog entry...   ~peace.

IT was one of those days u didnt want to end cuz the person u were with was makin ya so happy.  but unfortunetly, it did and this will have a follow up on friday  Thursday: nothing really exiting happend. cept bad crucible act 3 and good crucible act 4.  and im really behind in bio  Friday: so remember that girl i was talking about on wednesday? (if you dont, look up at wednesday and refresh urself). so i walk into school today and guesse what?!?!?! my good friend is like all over her and shes all over him and i wanted to KICK HIM IN THE FACE! and i know it should be guys before girls and thats what i kept telling myself to restrain myself from punching him in the face...i hope neither of them read this.  she wore a shirt that i picked out for her on wednesday (we went to a mall too you see) and she looked mad hot.  but (to quote dana) woe is me ( ;) ) and im just imagining everything i thought she felt for me.  oh well...it happens. thats it         "
1061,Pisces,"       So, what exactly does that mean?  Ever since Tony started this site his photo gallery has said 'coming eventually.'  I think that it's time for Tony to get a little mtivated and put some pics out.  God knows that he has the time (I mean who watches 'Charmed?'  The only thing TNT is good for is 'Pensacola:Wings of Gold.')  Think Baywatch quality writing about Marine pilots.  Not as much eye candy, but it does have Sandra Hess.  I guess she's some sort of B-movie actress.  This is all I have seen her in, but... Very nice. We all also know that Tony has the pictures.  I mean, I get to C-bus maybe twice a year, but he certainly has enough drunken pictures of me to fill their own site.   Oh well, maybe it's just one of those things that are best unresolved.    "

I DIDNT FIND IT! so i went to bed thinking that my phone was ont he ground outside getting all full of water and morning dew, and then i had a few nightmares, and then claire called me saying that she took my phone home in her purse. it was a beautiful thing. thanks claire for making me one hour deprived of sleep. jk  i love this SAT class, its full of 12 hot junior guys  i want to announce to the world that i have overcome a large barrier in my life, as of yesterday. and it feels good. it took a lot of cold pricklies to make it happen, but i got 'er done.   wewell i hafta go play nintendo..peace  holla  'I DONT KNOW WHY WE ARE YELLING!!...LOUD NOISES!!' ~ the best movie ever   ****striz          "

1067,Pisces,"       It’s crazy how you never know!  You never know whose watching who’s listening and who knows more than you think.  There is no trust amongst family and friends any more.  If there ever was?  I wonder sometimes if that trust that I felt and that bond that I imagined was there ever was.  Was I the blind one?  I believe I was.  I now see a world of liars, cheats, thieves and back stabbers.  No down to earth trust.  Is there even a need to be trusted?  I know that I once had that need.  I would go to the bitter end to prove my loyalty; and what happened I got fucked.  Bent over and shafted.  I chalked it up to bad decisions and tried again.  Once again I'm bending over the railing.  Chalked up, another bad decision.  Down the road I am more cautious now, I watch closely the ones that I least expected…but I was still blind.  I was blinded by my own weakness to want to trust and be trusted.  It may be a natural human need, but it’s a weakness. You see my take on it is everyone is out for themselves.  They will lie and play up to everyone and anyone including the ones they love.  For some reason they have been trained to think like this and it’s unfortunate.  They lack the ability to see the power that comes with numbers, trust and loyalty.  It’s b/c of this trained way of seeing and thinking they will struggle maybe not in the physical means of life but in the mental means.   But what about me?  What about the person who wants to trust and wants to be trusted and loved?  You want to know?  I become cold.  I become trained to no longer let you in.  I develop methods to trick you into feeling like I’m close and you can trust me cause I am only out for myself.  I learn to drown out that desire to trust and be trusted.  I drown out the desire to love and be loved.  I become all those people I despised for hurting me.    I see now, that’s how it happens.    Well fuck that!  I’m better than that.  I am not you!  I am not the lying, cheating, stealing prick you are!  I will be successful and I will not forget those that helped me get there.  I will earn my trust as they will mine.  I will have a team and together we will accomplish great things.  I want to and will see those close to me (though there are few) happy.  I will be able to trust again.  I will be trusted.  Although I will not be fucked b/c you never know who’s watching, who’s listening and who knows more than you!  I will have a family and I will hold them dear to me and teach them all that I can about life.  I will be there for them no matter what the circumstances!  I will never turn my back on them and I will show them a love that no material possession can ever take the place of.  They will be able to trust me……this will be my success!          "
1068,Leo,"           Music I enjoy: Heavy Metal, Old School Rap (mostly early 'gangsta' rap), Neo-Metal type stuff (like korn, system of a down, orgy, stuff like that) Primus (because they don't really fit anywhere else), the occasional hardcore techno-esque song (Aphex Twin's 'Come To Daddy' was genius). I have a dark past. I used to listen to pop rap. Yup. I who worship Nine Inch Nails and the Beastie Boys, once owned two tapes by marky mark and the funky bunch. I also had vanilla ice's first album, and I was way into the fat boys. I'm over that now (thank {your deity here}), but I have a new vice - Cover songs. I don't know what it is, but I really love it when a group takes a classic song and perverts it just the right way. Marilyn Manson's 'Sweet Dreams' and 'I put a spell on you', The Mighty Mighty Bosstones 'Detroit Rock City' and 'Enter Sandman' (and I don't even like the bosstones. at all),  anything like that, I love it. Music I DO NOT enjoy: teeny pop, country, whiny alternative garbage. pretty much anything written before 1980 (and most of what was written in the 80s), manufactured bands (like n*stync, backdoor boys, and the countless other new kids/menudo clones) britney spears (both personally and musically - I hope she gets attacked by killer bees and stumbles into traffic, where she would be run over by christina aguilera's tour bus, which would then careen off a cliff, exploding in a glorious fireball upon impact with the cold hard ground.) christina aguilera (she learned spanish so she could record a spanish language album because she wanted to be true to her roots. her roots are in new england) and I'm not too fond of the elevator music crap that people like enya keep oozing all over us. ok, feeling better now. I got some rare old anthrax off napster (gives finger to 'The Man') so I'm great. Speaking of napster, it's nice to see the true artists coming out in favor of napster. most artists are pretty neutral on napster (the 'who gives a shit?' attitude is cool), some are really pissed off about napster (not to name any names *COUGH*metallica*COUGH*), and are trying to get it banned. those artists are money hungry, and not interested in making music for the sake of making music. and then there are some artists (Like prince and rage against the machine and chuck d and offspring and limp bizkit) who actually like napster, and encourage it's use. rage against the machine's management actually banned some users, so RATM apologized by offering a bunch of cool music on their website (to make up for some of their fans being denied the music they wanted). uh, what was I talking about?.... To Hell with it, I'm finished. (gives another finger to 'The Man' just for fun)         "

1072,Virgo,"            I know I am not ready to have kids yet. All I want is a puppy. My husband's mother keeps asking him if I am prego yet..I have a few issues with that. First is that, we haven't even seen each other since June, so if I am prego, it isn't his. Second,  I don't really want a baby until after law school. I have 4 years ahead of me that are bound to be extrememly stressful and I would hate to not be able to enjoy my child growing up.  There are other people in my husband's life that have asked a few times if and when am I getting prego. My conclusion is that the Chinese view of family is different from the American view of family in such many Americans who can have kids choose not to have them at all, or prolong it until mid-thirties. Of course, I do want kids one day, but not until I have enough money to be able to buy them all sorts of crap that they don't need.  My mother is another one who says I can have a baby while I am in law school. Geez! Who are these people fooling???  One thing is certain, I will have all my children in the US so we can all float in and out of China and other countries without having visa issues.  The truth of the matter is that everyone else is just anxious to see a black-Chinese baby. What color skin will it have? Will their eyes be like mine or his? Will their hair be curly, nappy, or straight? Honestly, I don't care, as long as my baby is healthy.          "

1082,Pisces,"       ................................ Truth is overrated ................................  (the following are characters based loosely upon an actual conversation)  Joe: We're gonna win it all. We're gonna get to the tournament and win everything.  [silence on the van.]  Joe: Well?  Andrew ?  Whaddya think?   Andrew: I think you've got two of the three principal virtues going on -- faith and hope -- so that seems good.  Ryan: do you really believe that those are the three principal virtues?   Andrew:  Um. They're Pauline.  The church affirms them.  That's my tradition.  I guess so.  Ryan:  Well it just  seems like there might be other virtues.   Andrew stares out the van window at the passing cornfields.  Lots of passing cornfields.  It's Ohio after all.  Ryan interrupts his reverie.  Ryan: What about truth?  Shouldn't that be one of the virtues.   Loud anthem-like Rock music fades up in Andrew's head.  YEAH, that's the point, Ryan, he thinks.  Truth is overrated.    It's not a commandment.  It's not a fruit of the spirit.  It's not one of the three principal virtues.   Ryan:  Or integrity.  Shouldn't that be in there.   Exactly, Ryan.  Integrity must be understood in the shape of LOVE faith hope patience gentleness humility LOVE.    truth is contextual, relational and communal.  And THAT truth is underrated, i'm thinking.    "
1083,Sagittarius,"        Decisions, decisions  Okay, so on the one hand I have an upcoming 2 weeks of vacation and a paycheck to blow.  On the other hand, I have an ever-inceasing debt due to the daycare.  About the amount of one paycheck at this point.  So, pay the bills or have fun?  Believe it or not, I'm actually not sure what to do.  I've got my whole trip planned, and people are excited and anxious for the arrival of the diva and her little divas.  And, after 4 years of really crappy stress and hard work, I believe I deserve a great vacation.  But, there's this little conscience jerk whispering in my ear that I really should get caught up on this bill.  It would be the right thing to do.  So, I'm working on ignoring the whisper and figuring out how to pay the bill as soon as I get back! *sigh*  I really hate being a grown up.  On a happier note,  my little jet-setter diva returns home today!  I can't wait to see her, she's probably grown 4 inches since I last saw - a whole 12 days ago.  Yay! She's home, she's home.  Of course her little sister isn't nearly as excited as I am.  She has really enjoyed being an only child for a while.  Also, I'm doing something nice for someone I care about today.  I can't wait till he gets my little surprise.  I love doing nice things for people I care about.  Diva out.           "

1085,Cancer,"       there is a sign in the window of the local hairdressers that says 'models required'. firstly, it occurred to me to respond to the advert; surely there is money to be made for a young lad with a passable face and a willingness to submit his hair to the whim of fashion? and then secondly, i had a much better idea: i shall hang my own of these notices in my window, and see what comes of it. models wanted.   actually, it isn't true. i am so much more content with real people, capable of conversing and, where necessary, cutting me down. girls with charm are welcome, models need not apply. i just liked the thought of it, that's all.  i am watching films recommended to me by my therapist. i am intrigued to know what his aim is, and what my reaction will be.   a historical note: 'interesting' was the last word i ever said to charlotte. i do not recall who hung up immediately after.  even as i lay dying i am certain the experience will fascinate me. my epitaph, already planned (and which i fully allow anyone to use, if they wish), will read: 'that was interesting'.   in my lifei have been guilty of many things, and innocent of many also. my wonder at the world is matched easily by my cynicism, and yet the one ever-persistent feature is fascination with the sensation of living. it is fair to say i have never felt anything like it. recently spending time with ceri reminds me of the fervour with which she embraces life, and the way with her i couldn't help but do the same. i try to remember that when the time requires it.   a downbeat post; my apologies. and it started so well. i often find that this is the way things happen. although, to be fair, often the other way too. how interesting.

1086,Libra,"       The cats dealt with the fireworks okay last night, though they both sat up with me until 1:00 am or so, something they almost never do, these days). Tammy is over ten years old and Chelsea is almost ten. They have been around since before I moved to Seattle. Feeling philsophical, and I realized that one day they will be gone. What the hell will I do then?  I have 'Life in General' playing, and the song 'Change' is resonating with me. The approximate lyrics, below....    House of wonder, house of pain Looking out for all the things that I have tried to rearrange Boiling water, burning sun Holding onto memories of everything that I've ever done  Change is coming and change is good,  It's done everything that I ever wished it would But it keeps me awake at night.  Worn-out shoe soles, hurting pride,  Making sense of all the places that I've been on the inside Hands are hurting, waking nights Now I wonder why I ever wanted to start this fight  Change is coming and change is good It's done everything that I've ever understood But it stands so tall, it walks so strong, It's taking over me Change is coming and change is good It's done everything that I ever wished it would But it keeps me awake at night.  And red-orange leaves fall into love Watching as the wind fills the wings of my very own turtledove  Change is coming and change is good It's done everything that I ever wished it would But it stands so tall, it walks so strong It's taking over me Change is coming and change is good It's done everything that I ever wished it would But it keeps me awake at night. Yes it keeps me awake at night.   So why does it seem like the right song right now? Well, I guess change is coming, though not sure yet from where. I'll have to try and figure that out. Its not exactly feeling depressed but certainly its reflective...  In the meantime, its a relaxing day off. The groceries were delivered and there are plenty of non-work items to keep me busy. What else could someone ask for?    "

1088,Scorpio,"           It’s 11:15 in the morning, and my stomach and head are at war. It’s Day One of Phase One of the South Beach Diet revisited, which means I’m on a strict, imbibe-no-crap regimen. It’s also the day we take my co-worker to lunch for her birthday. The Birthday Lunch is a ritual that began when people lived in caves. You can see it on the walls at Lascaux – the piercing eyes of stick figure cavemen imploring, asking the birthday caveman how his mastodon tastes. He responds with a tentative grunt, self-conscious, polite. They make small talk and navigate uncomfortable pauses by taking keen interest in their food. Later, there’s cake.   Apparently, we have not progressed. The co-worker assigned to round up the troops lets us know the Birthday Lady has decided on Olive Garden.   Olive Garden.   Olive Garden, where I can eat exactly one thing on the menu, the Chicken Caesar Salad, and watch the rest of my table feed on sumptuous-smelling breadsticks. Olive Garden, where they serve you salad family style before bringing your meal, which means I will eat redundantly, salad followed by salad. Olive Garden, where the A/C is cranked to nipple-hardening, lip-numbing temperatures, where they bring you full glasses of iced tea rather than just fill your half-filled glass, leading you to feel a contractual obligation to drink more tea, where you are indeed a pawn in some waiter’s kill-the-lunchtime-boredom game of Customer Iced Tea Drinking Races, where the waiter will mention I look tired at lunch when, really, I look ripped-off and petulant, the result of being dragged, not exactly against my will but not exactly out of instinctual, let’s-eat-there impulse, to Olive Garden.  They seat seven of us at a ten-top and won’t seat us at the eight-top the next table over because that’s the “training section.” This means we are assuredly in the hands of professionals. Our professional waiter saunters over, suggestive-sells us drinks (we decline), suggestive-sells us appetizers (we decline), and hands us menus, thinking us cheap and unfestive, which is not altogether inaccurate.   I look at the menu, scan the items, confirming the worst. Carboload. Carbomax. Carblicious. Carbohydrate Surprise. Carb To My Lou. Carbeteria. Chicken Caesar Salad. Defeatedly, I place my order, and settle into a randomly-firing conversation about negligent boyfriends, mundane vacation spots, and death.  No matter how witty your co-workers, no matter how much lemon butter is drizzled over the main course chicken, no matter how quick and efficient your waiter, Birthday Lunch is the Hindenburg of lunch dates. If you live in an office with politics, they will edge the bare spots in conversation and poke through like weeds to sidewalks. If you cannot speak frankly and openly under the flourescent lights of your office, you are doomed to fail under the non-descript light of a chain restaurant.   Tempers will flare. Envy will lick its lips and look for a hand mirror. Ennui will take a silent roll through the gates in a giant wooden horse. Birthday Lunch will make you pine for other discomforting engagements, like College Reunion Karaoke Night, or Acquaintance Strip Club Bachelor Party, or Obscure Relative Closed-Casket Funeral.   And then, later, there’s cake.  If you are dieting, cake means watching other people eat cake. It means singing-in-public punishment and then declining cake reward. It means wearing a forced smile and drinking from a comically-oversized glass of water in a valiant effort to feel full, compliments on your willpower, tsk-tsk chiding from those who can’t resist pointing out, “You don’t know what you’re missing,” when, in fact, you do. It means 15 minutes of conversation with the entire office as difficult to predict as roulette. Could be boredom, could be agitation, could be earnestly funny and the highlight of the work day, could be harrowing cryptic precursor to layoffs and reassignments and general work-related doom.   At the point in the proceedings you wish your parents were there, so you could ask to be excused from the table, you may beg off and return your cubicle and let your email and your homepage of choice and your personalized screensaver soothe you back into the space that is no longer shared, to the refreshing consolation that though no man is an island, sometimes, you get to be relatively close to an island – perhaps, an isthmus.  And, if you are like me, you know that sometime in the next 364 days, the discomfort of the Birthday Lunch will be on your behalf. And if you are like me, you can’t predict the level of angst or boredom or restless fuss that will tether itself to your day. But you will know, at least, that you will have your pick of restaurants, and one guess as to where you won’t be dragging the rest of the office.           "

Sorry to those people, because I've just been so touched by the song 'I Believe', and I'm gonna right about the finale of a phase in my life, and the beginning of another.  My dear friends would know that today was my last day at a place that I've detested and cursed for 2 years; the Boarding School. As I lay on my bed, the one that always seemed so uncomfortable at night but so appealing in the day, I heard the sound of something bead like falling on the floor. I looked in between the gape of the bed and the wall, and there was this glass star, the star that I had recieved on my first week here. I felt it extremely appropriate that I got the star back at the start of a new chapter in my life.  Enoch and Ken Wei helped to carry my stuff down, and him waving as my car went off reminded me of the ending of the movie 'Big Fish', where the characters of the persons life waved him his last goodbye, without any tears, but instead with joy. It is today, as I wave goodbye to the shining star of Miss Barrino, that I've grown the '10 inches more' that mother has always wanted...         "

1093,Cancer,       okay so like 3rd dayof gym in a row and my teacher wasnt there...this...is my theory of why.  before she would be all 'go wait for me outside' then the class like the good little students we are would all go outside.  shed come out..maybe 5 to 10 minutes later and yell at us cuz we didnt wait in the hall like she told us to. and ya if one or two people thought we were supposed to go outside thatd be fine...but the entire class heard her say we were.  so im thinking shes finnally flipped off the deep end and is locked up in an institution for schitzophrenia.  thats about it for today. oh ya when we were playing frisbee in gym i hit this short little fat kid who makes fun of us all...so that was nice. and my freind adam hit this girl racheal twice on accident...one in the head and another time in the leg (she jumped into it). me and adam were laughing soooooooooooooooooo hard haha. anyway...thats all

When the time comes though, I really wonder what I'm gonna be like.... like in college will I be the party girl, haha possibly, or still like kinda shy and laid-back, meh I dunno, but I think I'm gonna do better off than my sis..... I think I talked to more people than her today, it's sad 'cause I'm not even in college.   Ok so the day of hell and truth tomorrow...... sechdules, once in your hand and once you've left the building, they're basically finalized, scary my junior year..... please shoot me now. Also it's picture day, must look good or else all is hell when that yearbook gets put into everyones hand.  Man this is seriously all scary, we're all about to start a brand new year in school, sure people will be the same for the most part, but maybe not..... summer changes people and it's weird and when school starts up again change in people will progress in them more, I just can't wait to see the outcome of people at the end of our high school careers... crazy. Well we all will continue on and embark on our daily journeys, but for now mine is off to bed! : )~Kati         "
1098,Sagittarius,"       I probably had the worst start to my day after ages, this morning.  Got a call at 4am from my aunt, that one of my distant grandfathers' had passed away.  This grandfather was one of those cool grandparents I had, really cool guy, smart cookie and amazing in vedic maths.  He had been suffering with Spinal Cancer for over 1 year and really everyone knew his days were numbered.  Guess I just didnt want it to happen so fast!  Anyway, could hardly sleep after that.   Began my day with an hour of SS Music.  Was quite surprised, coz these guys too play some good music in the mornings.  Heard this song from Def leppord, been an age....kindof brought me to tears...probably my next post would have to be this song....'two steps behind'...one really moving song..and then heard songs from Micheal Bolton, 'when a man loves a woman', Rod stewart, Bryan adams, Sting, ' All for love', From the OST of Alladin, 'whole new world', George Micheal ' jesus to a child' & finally Duran Duran' ordinary World'.  Had to have some of the new medicines this morning, and man, are the terrible medicines or what, I almost feel as though I have morning sickness!!! Yuck..totally disgusting...!  This is the heights of non sense in my life, my eyes are burning like crazy because of the lack of sleep, my stomach is behaving like a rollacoaster, and I feel like I'm living in the theory of constraints!

1099,Aries,"            urlLink  Report: SUVs pose danger to cars   Congressional hearing focuses on safety   Wednesday, February 26, 2003 Posted: 1:06 PM EST (1806 GMT)    WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Congress takes its closest look at auto safety on Wednesday since the Firestone tire debacle nearly two years ago, probing the safety of sport utility vehicles.   Regulators, auto makers and consumer groups were scheduled to testify at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on rollover risks, seat belt use and other safety concerns associated with one of the most popular vehicles ever.   The spotlight will be on the nation's top auto safety regulator, Jeffrey Runge, who last month stunned the industry by criticizing SUV safety. The administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration called for meaningful and swift changes.    Concerned about deaths   Runge, an emergency room physician who will be the featured witness at the hearing, is most concerned about rollover deaths and injuries in sport utility vehicles, seat belt use, and the threat posed to smaller cars by bigger and stronger SUVs.   'SUVs inflict more harm on occupants than other cars do,' said Brian O'Neill, president of an insurance industry group that will release new statistics on SUV safety at the hearing.   The group's report, an analysis of government safety data, will show that sport utility fatality rates have fallen sharply in recent years and are now almost even with passenger cars.   But O'Neill said the analysis will also show that because of their size and weight, sport utility vehicles can cause considerable damage to smaller passenger cars in side-impact crashes.    Making their case   The auto industry aggressively defended SUV safety at a news conference on Tuesday, and plans to do the same before Senate lawmakers.   'SUVs are very safe vehicles,' said Sue Cischke, vice president of safety at Ford Motor Co. She said sport utility vehicles are under attack for some of their most noteworthy attributes.   'They do well in front crashes, side crashes and rear crashes,' Cischke said. 'Unfortunately, many people who are killed (especially in rollovers) many times are not wearing safety belts.'    Acknowledging concerns    But the industry has recently acknowledged SUV safety concerns that critics have complained about for years, and federal regulators and Congress have sharpened their focus on them.   The industry's chief lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, has released data that auto companies agree with government figures showing the fatality rate in rollovers is three times greater for those in SUVs than for those in cars.   Auto makers have also promised to work together to reduce fatalities and injuries resulting from weight and size differences of SUVs and passenger cars. Some longer term improvements could involve design changes in one or both classes of vehicles.   The car companies are trying to head off regulation, which Runge threatened to pursue if the industry did not act voluntarily.   But some critics complain the industry is ceding a little ground now to ease pressure for new regulation and that voluntary design changes could take several years. It can take the government four years or more to approve new regulation.    Some Call For Fast Action   Joan Claybrook, a former director of the federal auto safety agency and now president of consumer group Public Citizen, says Congress should immediately mandate new rules.   'The industry has known for years about these dangers and has bobbed and weaved to avoid regulation,' Claybrook said. 'The government has also dropped the ball.'   Claybrook was also a fierce critic of industry and government action during the Firestone tire saga in which millions of tires were recalled in 2000 and 2001 after tread separations and blowouts were linked to more than 270 deaths. Most of those tires were standard equipment on Ford Explorer SUVs.   Congress passed landmark auto safety legislation after that investigation.            "
1100,Gemini,"        Instead of a Dark Lord, you would have a Queen, not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Tempestuous as the sea, and stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me and despair!   --------  What lies in the depth of man's soul I wonder? What drives us - man, woman, beast - to do the various things we do, both humane and horrendous. What makes us crave attention yet shy away from those who seek to delve further? We constantly search for some sort of completion, some peace, some task that makes us feel whole inside. We look toward the sunrise and make a promise of renewing our forms, then at sunset recall a time that made us smile or yearn for that which is to come.   We have murderers, rapists, child abusers amoung the nuns, orphanages and saints at large. We are all made of the same components yet we differ so greatly. Every day we go on, forgetting that a million different tasks are being done inside our bodies to keep us living our lives. I am a Queen, yes...but I am also like you. I am vulnerable to certain attacks or compliments. My heart may be made of ice, but it beats like yours...it yearns, like yours, it aches, like yours. My soul may be barrent and questionable at times...but it too has a validity that needs no justification. And my mind...my mind works like yours, trying to be seperate from my heart and my soul, yet failing miserably at times. It knows confusion with the element of hope, yet prepares itself for disappointment in it's sorting out process.   What I ask...is the depth of man's soul.           "
1101,Scorpio,"             Haha! Today was my group's Youth Day presentation, and I tell you... It sucked! Why? Because it was so incredibly boring, and it didn't induce any strong emotion from the audience. That, is what you call a horribly horrid performance!  And I tell you, their downfall was using the most amateur instrument of modern day poetry, rhyme! Lousy, lousy, lousy, and they all thought it was marvellous... It is such a straightforward recitation of our thoughts that even my mom conceded it was bloody boring. Why, why, why? Why didn't they just accept that laughter is always the best way to get through. Why did they not accept my script? Because they wanted it serious.   I tell you that if you're being judged by a panel that supposed to be open to all forms of presentation, that thing would have been so fine, but hello, in front of a larger audience, the one sure thing that will win all of them is their participation. What can induce them to participate? Clapping! What can make them clap? LAUGHTER! Next time something like this happens... Fuck it off, cause they're not going to listen to the truth anyway. This team is so fucked up. Make Michael god then...         "

Jerry was holding my step moms cell, and i forgot to get it back from him...so i had to ride up to his house...which is all up hill. And i had to mow the lawn...my step mom wont leave me alone...and i have to get a haircut too...i get no time to relax today.  OOO! OMG! Shes back! I missed her soo much! Yay! Jordan is back!

1105,Virgo,"                 hey all hows everyone doing   heres my testimony   Hello everyone my name is alice i was born in london ontario. when i was 2 my dad left my mom I never heard from him again. My mom had schrezphrenia was unable to look after me so i was put in a foster home. Then i was adopted when i was 4 by my grandparents and moved to timmins. Growing up my grandparents were christians although they never told me. They never really talked about their faith. I grew up as a catholic. I went to sacred heart church and was baptized when i was 12 there so i could attend sacred heart school as my grandparents felt it was a good school to get into. I also went to church at sacred heart church and i would listen but never really felt like i belonged there. Me and my grandpa would go from church to church trying to find the right one we never seem to settle down in a church. We went from church to church for a while and then finally we gave up altogether going to church because we couldnt find that right one. I was never a happy child growing up as i was teased alot.I was born with epilepsy and grew up having seizures all my life. When i entered highschool it stopped and then came back again when i graduated. After highschool i started hanging out with the wrong crowd getting involved in fights getting in trouble bars drinking etc. It was a life i enjoyed at the time but was making me really depressed. Then after that i started to work at lords kitchen a place for people who have no food to come and eat weekly. It was there i met a guy and we started dating. It was pretty good for about a year but then he never made time for me anymore so i ended it . He was my whole life , nothing else mattered to me thats why when i feel the relationship ended.  God showed me that i needed to change and that wasnt the kind of relationship he wanted me to have and not a good way for me to live to depend on someone else for happiness. We broke up after a year together. At that point i felt my life was falling apart, i wasnt getting along with my grandparents as we were always arguing i was in special olympics at the time and i wasnt getting along with any of my friends, so i felt like i needed somebody i dont know where i came up with the idea to do this but after the breakup and the loss of friendsips and the not getting along well with my family i went to my apt said a short and asked jesus into my life and prayed that he would help me sort out my life. Not long after my grandma called the baptists church looking for christians groups to hang out with thats when i found out about c&c i started going there at bfa. Then i started looking into joining a church would go regularly between bfa, faith community trying to decide between the two which one i would attend. Then after a while i finally decided on faith community but wasnt really sure that i wanted to a member right away and wasnt really ready to be baptized yet as i was still sorting out my life and taking one day at a time not really making any commintments. So i started attended faith community and going to college and careers it was going good i was meeting new friends praying and doing bible studies i was learning a lot about god and the christian life. My mental health wasnt doing so well. I wound up twice in the hospital because i was feeling very suicidal and it was god who kept me from doing it getting me into the hospital before i did something to myself. The second time i wound up in the hospital some friends came to visit me when i was there. They gave me some tough love, which i never had before and aksed me a lot of questions to make me look back and reflect on my life and what i was doing with it. It gave me a lot to think about. As at that point in my life i had nowhere to go the drs and councillors didnt want me living in a homeless shelter as i left home looking for an apt and they were looking into places in which i could live , which was even more things i needed to decide i had to make a lot of decissions and quick so this is the time when i needed god the most, and when he made himself very clear in my life and helping me out in the most difficult time of my life. After my friends left the hospital i spent my week in the hospital praying and reading the word trying to find the answers and solutions i needed to fix my life around as i was so unhappy with the way things were going and i needed to do something drastic to change my life. I did a lot of reading in the psalms that week as the ppl in the bible were all in down times and in depression which is what i was going through so i could relate to them. I knew that i was tired and didnt wanna end up in the hospital it was not how i wanted to live. I wanted to be happy and joyful and live for the lord. So from then on i decided to change my life around to try better to get along with my grandparents not to hang around with the ppl who got me in trouble and to live life for god. I also decided to leave c&c for awhile even though it was a good group i felt i needed time alone to heal and get counselling and come back when i felt i was ready. I took about six months off i really got the chance to heal and also had a weekly hangout with some ppl just to keep in touch with some friends i had made from the group since i couldnt see them at the group for a while. I'm glad that i had that time off really felt like i needed it . I'm back in the group its going very well, on the right medication doing well with family and friends and living my life for god. It was a hard thing to go through but i learned a lot and all the time god was right there with me and never gave up on me even though i gave up on myself.       "
1106,Aquarius,"       Today I heard a school secretary say to a little girl, 'Now, you're not going to get suspended anymore, are you?'  As I passed by the conversation I wanted to say, 'No, you're wrong.  This little GIRL wouldn't do something to get suspended.  I mean look at her, she's cute, well-dressed, calm, and polite.'  And then metacognition set in and I realized that I had just committed a mental act of sexism.  Our mothers might not understand why this scene might make us step back and take note of our place on the 'balance of the sexes.'  My mother didn't even begin college until I, her third child, was in elementary school.  And she is the only one of her sisters to have a college degree.  A few years ago, she got her Masters in Administration (approximately 1 year before I go my Masters), hoping to become a school principal.  It seems that her age has hindered those hopes, sexism replaced by ageism.  (My mom is older than my friends' parents.  She has a 39 year-old son after all.)  I'm not sure if this is really true, but she continued teaching and thanks to Bush's unfunded No Child Left Behind, she has, in fact, been left behind.  It now appears that she must have in hand a different type of Masters to do the same job she's been doing for 3 years.  But, I'm sure that 40 years ago she never would have thought she'd be worrying about what type of Masters Degree she had.  Former generations of women only hoped that women would have as many choices and possibilities that we do now, but with the entire world laid out before us, what do we really have but more questions?  What if we just want to be married and have children?  And that's it.  What if we want it that simple?  Is it sacrilege to not take advantage of the choices, or is that the whole point anyway?  I personally would feel no shame in dropping the 50,000 dollars and 20 plus years spent on my education to be a happy homemaker.  But, alas, baby making and the perfect spinach quiche are not the path I stumbled onto, nor will it be anytime in the near future.  After all, I have a research project due for my 'might turn into a PhD' class.          "

1109,Pisces,"             Despite my being distracted by Dan Hamill's discovery of classic wrestling on channel 70, the vision of the new Hypefactor album became significantly clearer with a whirlwind editing/arranging sessions yesterday at the Birdcage. With this session, two songs, 1956 and TWOBASSES took massive shape and now have the structure and guts they need to become excellent songs. I heard B's new guitar parts for 1956 yesterday and was really happy with them. As usual, there was a lot to listen to, and this actually led to my editing new sections of the song just based on his new guitar parts. This song is a stormer. Meanwhile, he was really into my weird arrangement for TWOBASSES, which is basically two songs now, and I think we are going to treat it as such. the first half is acoustic/electro and the second half is a Stone Roses-esque dance jam. But each part uses elements from the other. I'm REALLY psyched.   If all goes well, we should have the album laid out and ready for live drums in the next few weeks. of course, Ash will come in this week and kill the buzz by wanting tons of stuff changed (I mean this in a good way).  Meanwhile, S.O. and I caught up with Mr. G and we saw SCHOOL OF ROCK featuring the genius that is Jack Black. This movie is hilarious and makes the best use of the Jack Black gimmick, taking it to new heights. What made it even more interesting was watching these kids rock out and they knew how to really play. I'd be curious to see how they cast this movie (something, I'm sure for the DVD). Then we met up with members of poontang and sang Verve and Robbie Williams songs till the wee hours at the original MOG hang out O'Hanolans.  And now the best news of the morning:  Revenge/Monaco album announced  LTM are pleased to announce a deluxe 2xCD reissue of the sole album by Revenge, the electro/hard rock hybrid fronted by New Order bass player Peter Hook between 1989 and 1992. Following the release of Technique in 1989, the four members of New Order spent time apart to pursue other ventures. Always intended as a proper band rather than a solo project, Hook was joined in Revenge by Chris Jones and Dave Hicks, and later by David Potts, who would remain with Hook as part of Monaco five years later. Indeed in some respects Revenge can be seen as a dry run for Monaco, who went on to deliver a top ten album and single in 1997. One True Passion was first released by Factory Records in June 1990 and spawned a trio of singles, 7 Reasons, Pineapple Face and Slave. Given free reign to indulge Hook’s leather-trousered rockist instincts, the OTP material welded hard rock to dance beats, with a lyrical focus on sin and redemption. The artwork was just as contradictory, combining sleek Peter Saville typography with softcore imagery by Suze Randall. The band toured like bastards, and in January 1992 delivered the excellent ep Gun World Porn, which offered a more laid back, intimate feel. Deleted after the messy collapse of Factory in late 1992, One True Passion has now been retooled and reconfigured by Hook and Potts, and comes with a full-length bonus disc of rare remixes and unreleased songs in demo form. Standout tracks include 7 Reasons, Deadbeat, Big Bang, State of Shock, Pineapple Face and Jesus I Love You. All material has been carefully digitally remastered. The set contains over two hours of music, and the booklet includes sleevenotes by Joy Division/New Order biographer Claude Flowers.   I feel it appropros that in the middle of my second CD exploring these very influences that this retrospective is announced. Mega!  F          "
1110,Pisces,"                  urlLink    Last night was mother daughter night.  Moms and I saw 'Adventures of a Black Girl in Search of God'.  We both left the theatre raving about how much we enjoyed the performance and were particularly impressed by the actress - Karen Robinson - who portrayed Rainey Johnson.  I completely related with her doubts and questions.  It's odd, because like her I was 'raised in the church'.  My mother has always been a very active member of her church and I know that it saddens her that I have seemingly given up on attending with her on a regular basis.  I've tried time and time again to explain to her the reason for my displeasure/distaste with some of the activities that I've experienced in her church, as well as the dislike I have for the ongoing gossip and controversy that I have observed there.    But, I'm off topic...Let me first tell you a bit about the play (in case you have not yet seen it). The story revolves around a character by the name of Rainey Johnson who is from a Black township in Ontario (Canada) called Negro Creek. She is mourning the death of her daughter, the death of a mother figure and is trying to sort out her relationship with God.  Throughout the play her faith is questioned and she ponders the basis of her beliefs.  Now, I should tell you that I was raised as an Anglican but attended Catholic elementary and secondary schools.  Although I may have taken it for granted at the time, I definitely value the education that I received in religion during my elementary and secondary education. I particularly value the encouragement of one religion teacher who urged all of his students  not  to simply accept any and everything as truth. Because of him, I have always asked questions and believe that questioning better enables me to justify and strengthen my beliefs. (However, I know that not every question may result in a definite answer). Anyways, based on the guidance bestowed on me by this religion teacher, I was brave enough to question one of my Sunday school teachers in church one day. (Note: This was probably while I was in the 9th or 10th grade). She had asked the class to rate our belief in all events in the Bible on a scale of 1 to 10. She went around the circle with every rating in the range of 9 or 10. However, when she got to me, my response was 7.  She then proceeded to ask me to provide a reason for why I had chosen 7; of course I explained to her that there were many occurrence in the Bible that I had questions about and also had recently been learning about the theory of evolution which did not seem to follow with the proposed creation story outlined in the Bible. Not once during my response did I say that I did not believe; my only statement had been that I had unanswered questions. Yet, instead of attempting to provide me with a valid response or justification, this Sunday school teacher chastised me for even questioning any event that I had read about.   This is turning into a much longer explanation that I had planned. To cut it short, from that day forward I distanced myself from the formal act of simply going to church. That days events and other events that came afterwards left me wondering whether these so-called church going Christians were really at church for the right reason. It seemed to be a charade where they sat in pews rocking and praising one moment and then as soon as they stepped out the door, they were whispering, gossiping and criticizing. However, unlike Rainey, I've simply realized that I don't need to be in a specific building to maintain a relationship with a higher Being and I don't need to broadcast to the entire world that I continue to try to build a relationship with that Being. But I am still searching....whether it's for God or for my Self, I really don't know.   ...rotating...   urlLink Red Star Sounds Vol.1: Soul Searching   ...anticipating...  contentment      "
1111,Gemini,"        Nice weekend has come & gone.  This past Saturday, Kat & I took the kids to their grandparents home in the big city of Morgan Siding.  Jordan & Casey were both excited to be able to go, so that was a good sign of what was to come.   We stopped at 'Hardees' to eat before making the drive & although the new burgers are good they are not worth the extra costs...  Still it was good eats.  Well, my mom & dad were excited to see the kids & we all had a nice visit.  I ended up taking the kids for a walk to see a old field that I used to play in as a kid.  That was fun, back when I was smaller it seemed like such a big adventure to walk this huge farmers field.  The big mystery of the field is that there are ghost stories associated it with it & big almost crater like hole that is like HUGE!  My mom calls it the 'kitty hole' so I walked my kids out to see it.  I think they were impressed.  Made tentative plans to celebrate Thanksgiving with my mom & dad.  Not sure which day we will feast, but it should be fun.  I'm off from HW on Wed. & boy am I looking forward to it.  Been so tired that I dont feel that Im doing my 'best' work anymore at either job.  It's tough lately.  Kat's Monte Carlo took a dump on her, so her sisters boyfriend borrowed her a winter car to get to and from work.  So thats good & bad.  Hopefully with tax money in a few months we can afford to get that car either fixed or a decent vehicle for Kat to drive around.  Kat wants to go see 'Matrix: Revolutions' soon, so thats cool I'll get to go see it again!  Well, nothing else new.          "

Actually, most of this started off on Friday evening, when I kindof went into this lull and complete depression.  The birthday party brought back a whole lot of memories for me and that absolutely ripped thro' my soul, I could feel this agonizing pain run thro' my heart.  Friday evening, I needed a change desperately after the gloomy time I had at office, and headed to the beach for a walk.   Man, one weird thing, but somehow usually the beach tends to calm my nerves down and it did a good job, but the effects were only temporary.  I walked at the beach, one solid brisk walk for 30 minutes and then picked up my aunt and headed home.  Rest of the day was most uninteresting to say the least!  Saturday start was a touch dull and boring, but towards the afternoon the spice began.  No idea really what happend to me, all I do know ws that I was hit by a hurricane.  All the medicines which I had been consuming, with god only knows what else began to takes its toll on me.  It all started off with a headache, nagging one.  I thought okay, must be one of those pshyco things, picked up a few DVDs and headed back home.  Watched this movie called HUM TUM, hindi movie, which if literally translated means, We U...!  The movie was one really good one, and personally enjoyed it, due to two reasons, It gave me some relief from my thinking mode and two, It re instilled by faith that our life is a long one, one never knows when and where their paths with cross and with whom, the uncertainity is really what makes life interesting and not driven by pain.  As I was completing up with this movie,  my little cousin called me and informed me that a group of us were heading to Spidey 2 and tickets had been purchased for me too.  So it was spidey time, the movie was pretty well made, good and worthy sequel.  But then towards the end of the movie, my headache got really bad and from absolutely no where this feeling of naseua took over me.  I headed back home at 7pm, and hit the sack.  Think I slept for 15 mnutes, and the nxt thing I knew was tht I was feeling so absolutely queezy in life & was running between the loo and my bedroom, poppin medicines.  This was a horrible feeling for me, and the pain of being stuck in such a situation was miserable to say the least.  Then as though my probs were not bad enough, my body decided to play a nasty game with me, and I developed severe muscle cramps at about 9pm.     With no medicine having any effect on me, courtesy of throwing up stuff over and over, I headed to my grandpa, to seek some emotional strength.  The pain simply began to take over my senses completely and there was hardly a minute I could stay without thinking of my soulmate, he was always this person who wanted to be with me when I was sick and in pain...haha, when I needed him the most, he just couldnt be there for me.  So ironic....after all that has happend in my life off late, all the nasty stuff said, all the pain caused for people around, all the sadness which still fills my heart, and all the so called anger which I am to have towards him, I still couldnt stop thinking about him thro' every second of those 7 hours of pain!  7 hours of pain which ripped thro' me completely, so bad that the doctors at home are quite baffled with my body.    Anyway, this pain continued on and on, medicines were having no effect at all me.  Even my uncle who is a doctor came in at 3:30am in the morning to give me relief, but all went in vain. Finally with no choice left at all, I was given an injection, and that knocked me out at 4:30am.  All the pain seriously got to me and I couldnt even hold myself.  Couldnt tell my parents even that I had a blackout the previous day, coz then they would get seriously worried.   Should be heading to the hospital this evening to do a complete checkup, since I totally scared everyone out of their skins today.  God...why the hell am I being put thro this emotional and physical torture....its killing me....I've stopped asking questions, so why stil this emotional and physical turmoil for me!!!         "

1126,Capricorn,"           The other day all most every Icelander did get this letter from Greenpeace members asking Icelanders to unite not to shoot whales (not with a Capital W Adam).  For last 15 years Icelanders haven't 'fished' whales for a profession but just before me and Svana went to BCN they started again with shooting 45 whales over a three year period.  It was in some countries outshouted that it was a scandalous that people shouldn't go to Iceland for that reason. Well Greenpeace did go a more civilized way of protesting now than 15 years ago, when they sunk 3 whale fishing boats, and did do Icelanders an offer that would be beneficial to the country. Well we didn't listen!!!  So German Greenpeace members did unite that every member would send a few letters each to every Icelander listed. And I got one. To start with the letter is in icelandic and says that the one who signs it did get a German version of it and does understand and agree with it. The biggest thing in this letter is that there are so many wrong things in it also it doesn't have all the facts like that we are fishing 45 whales out of (if I remember correctly) 6.000 and that they do eat a lot of fish away from us.  The best wrong fact is that the letter states that over the last 15 years popularity of whale meat has reduced substantially due to among others chemicals in the meat. Ok I can only talk for myself but the main reason in my believe is that it hasn't been AVAILABLE.   So now I'm writing this German Salim (good name for a German)to his email address he was kind enough to leave and putting him straight.  If somebody else wants to do the same is email address is s.hassan@gmx.de  About my injury I wrote about in last post the visual effects have reduced from the nose and chin and all I've got is this small Hitler like mustache.

1127,Taurus,"           Thanks to Nellai(Nellaiappan Soundarrajan) for lending me his laptop to record my thoughts over the weekend.I missed gvim, for Windows always expects her users to be pretty dumb!  I would love to live and die in Paris for it treats me so well, even though I have no ideals to live upto or die for.   I was in Rue Mechain to start my weekend for the sake of Vidya, my teammate and friend.The administrative headquarters of the school in which she studied, the St.Joseph de cluny in Malleshwaram,Bangalore, is located here in Paris and she wanted me to get some photos of it.  The street was barren and it was drizzling a lot. I thought it would be a holiday and thought of taking some pictures of the street and the door of the building and return. Also since I could roam around only in the weekends, it would be difficult to come in the weekdays and satisfy her wish. After taking a couple of snaps I went near the door. It had no numeric keypad which most of the doors in the houses of Paris have, but a button to press. I hoped it was a calling bell. I heard a couple of rings on pressing it. No response. Slowly I pushed the door to see that it was opened. A receptionist welcomed me. I explained her the purpose of my being there. She asked me to wait for sometime and went away to fetch a sister. There was no school inside as opposed to my belief. But it was a mother house and it hosted a church.  While waiting for the sister, another sister turned up in that room and before I could grasp  her face completely, she thrust a T-shirt into my hand and said, 'Have it' and went away without waiting for any answer as if I am there to receive whatever they give! I didn’t want to act rudely there. So I kept the T-shirt, for I should hand it over to Vidya, who was the root cause for it!  The sister whom I am supposed to wait for turned up and took me to a small meeting room. After my introduction, I came to know that her name was sister Violet and she is basically a Tamilian, whose family is in Bangalore and who is in Paris for 6 years now! She started conversing in Tamil. She took me to all the gardens and the church inside .She started with a tree whose seed was sown by the founder of the institution, St.Anne-Mary XYZ, which was almost 200 years old. Beside the church is the crypt (the tomb) of the founder. She said that in the box kept there, the heart of the lady is preserved! Then she showed me the office buildings and the sisters' residence.  Then when we were walking along a garden, as if she could connect two different things, she asked, 'Do you know to solve computer problems?'. She didn’t know that she is asking a guy who has slogged in a call-center like a night-watchman troubleshooting PC problems! But that necessarily doesn’t mean that she would be as dumb as some of those US customers! 'Yes.' 'Then I have a problem with my PC. Will you solve it?' 'Sure.' The stroll came to an abrupt end and she took me to her room where the PC was.From whatever she explained I understood that PC doesnt play audio.Its 5 years old and all along it has been like that with the dumb speakers staring at her and the poor lady has been watching her movies in another sister's room!She had tried calling up the technical support for no avail.They had replied that the essential software is already installed!Then she gave all the CDs that has been supplied with the PC.Here in Paris, she explained that even if you buy a PC, nobody comes to your house to install it or troubleshoot it.She had set the system up herself following the instructions given in the manual.Good job, I thought.After fumbling around for half an hour, I could install the right device driver for her sound card and made it work.She played a Tamil movie DVD and shouted, 'Thank You.Thank You.', on hearing the sound. 'Do you eat pork, beef and things like that?'. I was taken aback a bit. 'No. I am a vegetarian. But I'll take egg too'. Then she took me to a dining room. And gave me cooked carrot, cauliflower, mashed potato and some bread and cheese. She made some coffee too. In the midst she brought some prawn pickle and told me so. 'What is it?!' 'Fish. Vegetarians eat fish. Dont they?' 'Sorry. I don’t take it'. 'How come you do you eat these bland things with not much taste?'. I kept mum. I thought curd rice is enough to keep me going.  After conversing a bit she said, 'Am happy to see you.', with absolutely no sign of it in her face. All along, until this statement I was comfortable. But the way she delivered it injected a feeling of uneasiness in me and I wanted to move out of the place as soon as possible. I hate people whose heart and tongue do not express the same. She came until the main road and showed me the way to the nearest metro station. By now I had grown very uncomfortable about her and the place. I walked fast without turning back.  Religion is a dead body. For me, a perfect religion is dynamic. Nobody can come out with frozen rules and regulations for a dynamic entity. Does it sound like Heisenberg's uncertainty principle on the motion of electrons? My religion should be shaped every minute according to the tune of my soul by myself. Only I know how it dances. That is religion with life, for it evolves with me. Once I freeze it and write down stringent rules to be followed, the soul runs away as fast as He can and leaves the dead frozen body in my hands, useful for nothing and which would stink like hell. The stinking body would only attract vultures to it! Vultures do not have the necessary competence to catch their own live prey. They wait for something to be dropped down as useless, to pounce upon. I can see these rapacious vultures in contemporary religious leaders.  Musee Grevin is equivalent to Madame Tussaud's of London, hosting wax statues. The entrance to it had long set of mirrors which faced each other at an angle to produce infinite number of reflections. I realized that the entrance fee was 13 euros and walked back. Not worth it for somebody who converts euros into rupees before spending!  In that area of Fauborg Montmartre, there are ancient shopping complexes. They date back to 1800's! Every shop is unique. There were a lot of cafe restaurants in which much of romance was going on. I thought this is the place where I want to be, for it has life and expression. I felt relieved a bit. There were shops for philately, vintage photographic devices, books from gay sex to history of France, figurines of every character that you can imagine for kids. The place had a Paris touch, which always leaves a pleasant feeling behind. Inside one of those shopping complexes and on Rue de Fauborg Montmartre I spotted a couple of chocolate shops, handmade chocolates. The smell out of those shops made my mouth water! They were so rich.  But still I couldnt quite get out of the bitterness of that mother-house. So I consulted the map and among the few choices I had, chose the farthest one! It was Parc de la Villette. The guide said it hosted a science and technology complex. Thought that the place would be interesting, but not as quite as art or sculpture.  But when I was done for the day, I was equally satisfied! Its personally a healthy sign that science and technology can impress me as much as art! It was a big complex with various centers like Explora which hosted the permanent and temporary science exhibitions, Cite des Enfants which is a children's science village, centers for shows and films, forums and conferences. I chose  to go to 'The Geode', one of the theatres there playing short-movies, which Marc had told me would be good. It was, indeed. The geode is a sphere. And hence the screen of the theatre is a spherical surface, which is the speciality, as we see in planetariums. But the films that are screened seem to be special documentaries. Each film lasts for an hour. I have to choose one among the 5 films; 'L'Inde' Tigre' whose hero is the bengal tiger and which is inspired by Jim Corbett who pioneered the Indian wildlife conservation, 'Adrenaline' which studies sky-diving, 'Station Spatiale' which is the story of the world's first international space station or otherwise an orbiting research lab and the people who built it, 'La legende de l'etalon noir' which is about the friendship between a lonely girl in a desert and a young black stallion, 'SolarMax' which depicts the humankind's struggle to understand the Sun. I could quickly narrow down to the last two.And the phrase 'struggle to understand' which prettily rings along the same line as  my state, decided the film.  They had given me a wireless headphone for hearing English audio instead of French and hence I could decipher and enjoy the film. The film was fantastic. It was written, produced and directed by John Weiley. It explained how our forefathers studied the sunlight to mark the start of the year, about Aristotle's geo-centric universe(I was very happy to see his face), the genius of Copernicus who propounded the heliocentric solar system, Galileo Galilei who built the first ever telescope to view the objects in the sky and confirmed Copernicus's proposition, how he was shown the tools of torture by the then government of his to make him accept that he is speaking nonsense (!).Here I thought that when there's a clash between an intellectual and a society, its always the society which loses the battle in the long run, irrespective of the immediate outcome , even if the individual is killed as is the case of Socrates, for intellectuals are dynamic and society tends to be static and hence falters. The point where dynamism should necessarily succeed the static rule is seen, by commons, as a revolution, which inevitably leads to another higher state and wait for another revolution to take it further above! It takes a genius of a character like Mohandas.K.Gandhi to design and spearhead a revolution without a single drop of blood. India, if not for anything else, can be proud for having produced this prodigal son who claims to have experimented with truth when I am struggling to discern it.  Art is waiting for another Picasso and science is waiting for another Einstein. This is how we climb the staircase of civilisation.  The two shows in planetariums, which I had seen in India, stopped with Galileo, as if he is the most recent and modern astronomer.But the film came far ahead.It went on to explain about the sun's dark spots, study of sun's composition through spectrography which was very neatly and  succintly put as based on the property of elements to absorb a unique wavelength of light to leave a unique signature in the spectrum, the way kids could easily understand, Berkelin's theory that sun spews out energy symmetrically through both of its poles and how humanity has to wait until man's first space voyage to confirm this hypothesis through videographing sun spewing out its corona, how earth is protected from sun's flares by its magnetosphere, how a couple of thousands of satellites placed around earth influence our daily life, how SOHO was built and placed a million miles from earth balancing exactly the forces of gravity due to earth and the sun to capture the sun's activity directly, how it was troubleshooted by the international NASA team for a silly mistake of their own which turned the system dead, where do we draw the frontier of science and technology now, role of the various observatories all over the world, how they form a chain to study the sun. A notice at the start of the film said that none of the images of the sun were created by computer animation, but were original images captured by various observatories around the world. I was very much satisfied with the film and its content and the way it was presented keeping in mind the level of knowledge of its audience. Brilliant.  I badly wanted something to drink and for the first time in Paris, I bought something to drink, a cup of Expresso Cafe and settled on a chair there.  The children I see here are pretty cute, with their rosy skin, blonde hair, tender lips, chubby jackets, faltering gait, questioning innocent deep stares. All over the world, children are the same. I feel like kissing these children on their cheeks and hugging them and playing with them and answering to their questions with utmost sincerity and successfully pass over atleast a part of my chaos to them! I want to grab all these nascent minds and make them grow as intellectuals. I was very angry then with the kind of range and method of education that the schools which I studied were able to deliver, when I wanted to learn something in my tender age and as good as now, when I was completely ignorant of my goals. I was very upset so much so that I wanted to build a school and create revolutionary concepts in imparting knowledge and which spews out nobel laureates! I would take pieces of coal as students and turn them into diamonds of immense value through the infinite energy of knowledge, by inspiring their elements to point towards one direction. I'll cultivate intelligence and harvest knowledge in the lands called their minds. I would make sure that these lands remain fertile by giving them enough nourishment from outside. I would deploy the best minds in this world to impart them the education. My school will have all the subjects ever touched upon by humanity and invent many more. Geniuses in art, sculpture, philosophy, literature, science, engineering, sports, music will be created. A student would pass out as a complete human being and a powerhouse of knowledge in his chosen field of study. The necessary and sufficient qualification for getting into my school would be the will to learn, the hunger for knowledge. And the necessary qualification to sustain oneself there, would not be the fee, but the love of his job. The system would be such that it would automatically eject out the incompetent or uninterested. Along the course of education from kindergarten to a doctorate every step, the tenure of it, the speed of it, the style of it, its composition, its breadth and depth, will be decided by the individual himself. There will be no admission based on age, race, religion, caste, previous field of study or any other bullshit. All  I needed were proper motivation and inspiration. I didn’t find one worthy blackguard who could deliver these. I'll create my own Men. I have never felt at home when I was in school or college. My children who study in my school will feel completely at home, with tremendous deal of motivation and inspiration around. This will come from the kind of teachers I have deployed and they'll be envied all over the world for the kind of pay that they would receive from me. I'll make these teachers, the gods of knowledge, as a bunch of richest men in the world. My eyes were hot with anger and as if to cool themselves they oozed out tears and they ran down to cool my face too! Its a shame on me that, for the first time, I cried in public. I said to myself, 'Get up. Don’t cry in public again. And don’t dream in public again.' I immediately mopped my tears and put the coffee cup in the dustbin and walked out of the place to the room. For the day, I can’t suffer anymore.  Since I am not yet 25 years old, I could visit almost all the places with 'reduit tarif'! This has saved me some euros. I had to give only 4.10 euros as against the usual rate of 6.10  to visit the Conciergerie.  The conciergerie is called so, for it was the office and residence of 'the concierge'( the keeper ) of the King, who was vested with lots of power. The entrance was a huge hall complete with Gothic archs. It looked royal. It has been originally constructed as an office but later many cells were added which made it the bloodiest prison in the history of France. After the great revolution in 1792, the accused who were thousands in number including personalities from all walks of life from peasants to emperors have been guillotined here. The prisoners faced only two options once they were brought in: freedom or death. Still I could smell the suffering of those hearts there, for the authorities have managed to keep the ambience intact and replay those events through documentaries and pictures well.  I could not even imagine the kind of suffering of the people who were sentenced to death would have gone through. If natural death disturbs me so much, how much these people on whom death has been imposed by heartless savages could have got disturbed? I wondered. It should have been a deadly agony for I read that some of them committed suicide with raw tools that they managed to procure there. The paintings there depicted the feelings who were guillotined en-masse in Place de la Revolution which is now the Place de la Concorde. Very somber. Man's intelligence is so paltry that nobody can ever manage to create a soul. I do not know who has any moral prerogative to put an end to one. No individual or government is qualified to bring an end to somebody's life, not even their own. Its the nadir of justice and the zenith of evil to award a judgement to a fellow human being as to end his life. Its not fair by any moral or ethical standards.  I came out with a heavy heart from that erstwhile prison.  Outside it was raining heavily and the weekend was marred by a pretty bad weather for sightseeing.So I returned to my room and continued my dreaming!  With her long lithe legs,  the lustful shape of the seat of her pants, the fatal curves of her pelvic girdle exposed neatly by her tight jeans, slender sleek waist, voluptuous bump of her bosom drawn by her skin-tight tops, shining shoulders, slender rosy fingers, svelte lines of her face, cherry red seductive lips, the lovely pink skinny cheeks, the wavy upperlip with its minute pale-brown hairs, the tip of the nose which has been made red by the blood rushing to rescue her white glowing skin against the chill wind which splits itself at that point notwithstanding the fast gait of hers, soft thick pink earlobes, the blue eyes which pierce into mine, the look of disdain as if she descends from heaven and I have dug myself up from the netherworld, the flaring forehead, the golden blonde hair which cascades down on her shoulders, the young french girl looks like an angel and disturbs me a lot. I've enjoyed seeing these features in the same fashion described atleast a few hundred times and I don’t think I'll ever get bored of it! The chill weather increases the need for warmth!  I saw the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life a couple of weeks ago. Her features had a deadly perfection. She was taller than me. She had the kind of face I would love to see every night. Being so close to me physically in a metro, her face told me that she is still unsullied. I couldn’t take my eyes off her blue ones till she disappeared from  my purview. Phew! It pained. I have not heard of a bachelor king. So my queen should be skulking somewhere out there. I should find her out. But how?!  Lets see! Lets Hope!  N.          "

And it does. &nbsp;My dad makes fun of me because when I try to make a basket with a wadded up piece of paper, I usually throw it horribly wrong, but it&#8217;ll hit the side of the bookcase just right so that it bounces in. &nbsp;That&#8217;s how my life goes.           &nbsp;         I guess maybe that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so good at photography. &nbsp;So much of it is based on luck. &nbsp;You always hope that you lucked out and clicked the shutter at exactly the right time.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a shooting strategy called the &#8220;hail mary&#8221;, where you hold your camera up over your head to get a better angle, and you pray that you get it right. &nbsp;&nbsp;I&#8217;m lucky, so more often than not, I do get the shot.           &nbsp;         I&#8217;m lucky because I never studied for a chem or history test, and I still ended up with and A in both classes. &nbsp;           &nbsp;         I don&#8217;t know. &nbsp;Its really weird. &nbsp;It just seems like everything falls together for me, just the way its supposed to. &nbsp;I haven&#8217;t decided whether or not this is a good thing.          I think I&#8217;m afraid that eventually my good luck will run out, and then I won&#8217;t have any idea how to take care of myself.           &nbsp;         You know, I think I might be a little bit of a megalomaniac {you&#8217;re no Jesus!... &nbsp;only he says it JAY-zus&#8230;} &nbsp;&nbsp;maybe. &nbsp;Maybe not.           &nbsp;      "

1137,Aquarius,"                  Tropical Adventures of the Fab Four Day #4   Another perfect day in paradise   Wow, what another absolutely gorgeous day! Kurt & Michelle couldn't have asked for more perfect weather for their vacation. We started out this morning after breakfast running a couple errands and filling the gas tank before heading down to Sarasota to Grandma's house. The guys got fired because they took WAAAAY too long (Kurt!) scoping out new snorkels and masks. They left us girls waiting and waiting outside JoAnn's (and believe it or not we were only in for a few minutes!)  We swung by Grandma's house and visited with her for a little bit and planned out our day. We put her shark's tooth scoop in our trunk and headed down to Venice. After swinging through a couple cool but kinda cheesy tourist shops we ate a nice picnic lunch in the park and then headed to Casperson Beach to hunt for shark's teeth. We met up with Grandma at the beach (her second home). She showed Kurt & Michelle how the hunt works. We found a nice bag full of teeth and even managed to scoop up some good sized ones. Grandma had the find of the day with a nice sized tooth that will make Kurt a nice necklace.   After Kurt started getting crispy we decided we would head out for some ice cream. Grandma led the way to Nokomis Groves and their famous ice cream stand. She had an orange vanilla swirl cone and the rest of us had a lime and chocolate swirl cone. Oh man was that delicious. There's something about the beach and ice cream that just goes together.   After our ice cream Grandma headed home and the four of us went alligator hunting. We headed to Myakka State Park, known for their alligators. We were not disappointed! We stopped at a bridge over looking the river and I think the guys took about a hundred pictures of the gators. They were cool and yet so scary!! They look tranquil in the water but just knowing what they are capable of is enough to put the fear in ya!  After we had our fill of gators we headed back to Grandma's and picked her up and headed to our favorite fish spot for dinner - Captain Curt's on Siesta Key. Kurt & Michelle had never had grouper before and we always order the grouper your way sandwich at Capt Curt's. I always get the grilled cajun grouper sandwich (ha ha, Dad I know you are jealous now!!!) Kurt tried it cajun fried and Ked and Grandma tried it fried and Michelle opted for a burger and tried some of Kurt's grouper since she's not a big fish fan and wasn't sure she would like it (but she did!) Yes grouper rocks and is my favorite fish of all time!!  After dinner we headed down to the beach on Siesta Key and got there just in time to see the big fireball sun set into the water. It was amazing how many people were there to watch the sunset. What is it about the sun that so fascinates us? We want to bake in it all day and we love to see it rise and see it set. It was a gorgeous pink sunset and the sun was enormous. It was a perfect way to end another perfect day. The beach was full of couples young and old walking hand in hand, hugging and kissing. A sunset on the beach is so romantic. *sigh*  We have been talking about key lime pie for days now and tonight we decided we had to get some. Kurt & Ked dropped us off at Grandma's and then they headed out to Publix for some pie. They were so sweet and even picked up Grandma half of a peach pie (her favorite!) and then a whole key lime pie for the four of us. Oooooohhhh, it was soooo yummy!! Ked is hilarious, he was grading the pie. He said he had to savor the moment with a cup of coffee and took his time eating his slice. Then he was comparing all the key lime pies he has ever eaten. Publix gets an A, and Pebbles (a restaurant we stumbled across in Orlando) gets an A+.  Grandma was glad to have the company today. She's always so much fun to be around. She said we kept her day from being 'ho-hum.' She is the shell queen and has collected shells off the Florida coast for well over 20 years now. Her place is filled with them! She made sure to show them off to Kurt & Michelle. She was talking about the miracle of all the life in the sea and all the creative shells. It truly is amazing.  Well that brings us up to now, 11:30 p.m. and we are all about to  pass out again. There's something so refreshing about sleeping hard after such a fun day of playing.  So goodnight world!! I'll post more pictures tomorrow. They didn't download them to my computer yet from their cameras tonight. They pretty much went straight to bed, and now it's my turn!               "
1138,Libra,"                 So the terrorists in Saudi Arabia have beheaded another American.  How do we handle this?  How do we stop this?  For years, I have said the way to stop planes being hijacked was the next time some group of terrorists hijacked a plane, we blow it up.  Yes, that would also kill all the passengers on board, but do you think any more hijackers would be lining up any time soon to hijack a plane?  Not all the terrorists are in such a hurry to go see allah as the ones on 9/11.  So, back to the question of how to handle the current crisis of Americans being kidnapped, and then beheaded when demands aren't met to release captive al-Quida members.  First of all, don't suggest, REQUIRE that all Americans in Saudi leave the country.  Secondly, what we should do THIS MINUTE is take every captive that the terrorists were demaning be released before they beheaded Paul Johnson and behead them.  They are making the rules, maybe it's time we started to play by them.             "

1147,Cancer,"       How Reading Employers’ Chromosomes Will Get You Riches I think it’s about time that you tap into the mind of employer to explore their needs and wants. After all they are the individuals who hire you. If you give an employer exactly what they need and want, then you will get the job.  Can I share a secret with you that very few people realize?  You can help control a person’s decision by creating emotion. The kinds of emotions that you want to create in an employer are excitement and curiosity.  Primary Emotions (feelings during finding an employee)  • Boredom: Let’s be honest. Reading hundreds of documents about people you don’t know or care about can get very boring, especially when over 90% of résumés are terrible by providing very few benefits if any at all.  • Confusion: Reading hundreds of résumés that aren’t equivalent to the position needing to be filled causes confusion.  • Urgency: Employers need help, and that is why they are hiring. They realize that they have a position to fill as soon as possible, and the longer it takes, the more money or productivity will be lost to the company.  Your objective is to cure these emotions for time that the employer takes to overview you as a candidate. You want to provide an “antidote” with your words. How can you do that…  Now that you know an employer’s habits, emotions, and desires, so now you play the right cards. The best way to change someone’s habits is to interrupt their pattern. How can we interrupt an employer’s pattern?  “Interrupt their present limiting pattern of association to create new results.” Tony Robbins  You can interrupt an employer’s pattern by giving them what they want. Instead of boring an employer, make them curious. Instead of allowing employer confusion, provide them with clarity. Recognize their urgency and provide them with excitement by providing a solution.

1148,Sagittarius,"        Right under my nose  You know how you can spend days, or even weeks, looking for something?  Then, you find it right in front of you?  I had one of those experiences.  I have been looking all over the place - online searching, magazine listings, related websites - trying to find somewhere to learn meditation ~ Tibetan Buddhist Meditation (this is where anyone who knows me for any length of time starts to freak out).  I searched high and low for a place to meditate, to learn how to really do it right.  I've been looking now for more than 2 weeks, and everywhere I turned, there was either a disconnected phone number or a dead e-mail address.  Apparently, Buddhists don't cling to communication ;)  I knew that the pastor at my church offered a meditation session on Monday nights, and I finally had a chance to check that out this Monday.  No school, no kids to pick up after work.  So, I went.  To my methodist church with my female pastor leading the sesshin, I had my very first guided Tibetan Buddhist mindfulness mediation.  It was all I had been looking for - and it was right there in front of me every Sunday on the church program.  Under my nose, literally.  Funny how things work out.  Diva out.         "

Some of the Good and some of the Bad to follow   Well, last night I found out that the girl I was interested in has a boyfriend (No it is not me).  That kinda sucks but ah well, what can you do... Nothing really exciting happened in school today.  Handed in the dumb 'shield' project.  It wasn't hard just stupid, as I commented upon last night.

If we keep advancing, the State Finals are the 10th and 11th of June.  Apparently putting eye black on me is now good luck for the team. Before the game, someone pointed out that they won the last game they put it on me, and now they're 2/2. It doesn't really bother me -- I just have to remember not to wipe my face.

1164,Cancer,"       I'm a clumsy bitch.  Always have been.  Years ago, one of my cousins nicknamed me 'Tommy Girl' one day after the 574,899th time I marked myself in some bizarre incident.  That day it was opening the door to my Grand Cherokee and proceeding to bloody my nose and black both my eyes in the process.  I can't tell you how many times I've been wounded by car doors.  Fingers slammed in them, legs slammed in them, hands rolled up in windows, hair rolled up in windows, jabbing myself on the top corner (you know the one, the wicked sharp pointy part), smacking myself in the face/head/body with them, breaking a finger hanging a ring on them.  You name it.   And that's just car doors, all the other assorted injuries due to other inanimate objects would take many more posts.  Today my cousin and I had to go to Walmart and get some washer/dryer crap.  I jumped out of the pickup and some of his assorted floorboard ornamentation fell out.

Pardon me for being a bit naive on the subject, but, what the hell? I might be a bit judeo-christian on this one, but shouldn't people who are maried atleast be attracted to the sex of their partner? I've heard of loveless mariages, but this statistic takes the cake. I cannot fathom how someone can be maried to someone of the opposite (or even the same) sex, unless they are attracted to that sex.

1170,Gemini,"             Well, yesterday wasn't the day. The Yankees didn't get the sweep we were hoping for, thanks in part to 2 errors. (Note: Lofton in right field?) Loaiza still isn't solid. Looks like the bullpen/long relief is in his future? Could be if Lieber continues his streak. No complaints, though. If we continue to win 3 out of 4, this will be a pretty good year. Look out tonight. Kevin Brown is pitching in Texas. Should be a good one.   How about Texas. The Orioles whipped them pretty bad. Their weakness (pitching) sure has been showing up lately. Not to mention the change in the Orioles since Ray Miller was brought back. If the O's keep rolling like this, hello wildcard. I hope so. I'd love to have the Yankees play them in the postseason. I'm no O's fan, to be sure. But there are some guys on their team I like. (Roberts, Lopez, Palmeiro, Surhoff.) Besides, I work within sight of Camden Yards. The Yankees knocking Baltimore out of postseason would give me serious bragging rights. That would be fun.    One more thought. For the future, watch for Tampa Bay. They are young and good and will only get better. Lou will make sure of that.          "

1175,Leo,"        Well nothing happened today, I'm not surprised. I feel useless, my mother is constantly bitching at me so I get frustrated and i'm like 'fuck it'.      It's so hard to not make my life sound like the one of another stupid teenager with depression. What I have isn't teen angst or  'oh god i hate the fucking world and i want to rip everyone's flesh into tiny little shreads and see them bleed as i tear them apart and hear them scream as i rip out their heart and hang them from the ceiling by their intestines.'  No, I don't think like that. Nor do I want to grab a knife and slash my wrists so that I can carry out some fucked up suicide attempt and have people feeling sorry for me.      Everything is so stereotypical these days.  There are smaller margins on what it is to be original.  People classify you no matter what you do.       1. Oh you dress in all black and have a pasty ass complexion, you must be a 'Goth!' or...    2. wow, you have different color shoes, checkered pants, a shirt that doesn't match, and funky ass hair you must be a 'punk!'...     3. then the classic (and yes, i hate it) khakis, with flip flops, a tight ass Abercrombie & Fitch shirt, with one of those surfer necklaces and spiky hair....oh no you're a 'prep!'        (but then again, everywhere i go i see these guys dressed like that with some blond girl at their side dressed in the female version of this so called 'fashion'. so i don't see it as original whatsoever. Paying $60 for some of those clothes Abercrombie sells, is seriously a crime)        You get labelled for trying to be original to some extent.      Some, well no,  most people think the Gothic culture is a 'music culture' . They think they are these weird satanical people that have an obession with death and will murder you if you get in their way. Personally, I haven't really gotten around to asking them why they dress that way but the basic overview is that it's not a music culture.   Back in the day people didn't have dyes for clothes so everyone had black or grey clothing. Goth is a type of architecture. The Visigoths existed in Germany. There are so many things that Goth pertains to, yet  we don't know anything below what we see.      Sure, most of them are what we call 'posers' who try to stand out by giving you muderous looks so that you'll leave them alone and be intimidated by them.      Then we typically  associate punks with the self mutilators  that go around with short sleeves so they can show the world their self inflicted wounds. Once again, most of the people I see at my school like that have kitten scratch 'wounds'. If you fucking wanted to kill yourself go slit your wrists nice and deep and don't show anyone!!  Why else would you go around showing everyone things like that? Oh,  I'm depressed and be afraid of me because i'm not afraid to carve out my veins!  Hmm....all I have to say is REAL PUNK IS DEAD. I don't blame them for wanting to dress like that BUT when it's obvious you are doing it for show more than hardcore addiction, watch out, you could get bashed!!!  (sense the sarcasm in that people)     On my part, that's a criticism, but don't blame me. I write what I see.     We purposely try to be someone we aren't to get a form of respect and fear. Power.     We also fear what we don't understand.  (damn that sounds so cliché but it's true) Get to know some of these people and see what they are really like.  In school I hear the 'preps' making fun of the 'goths and punks' because they're 'freaks' and they are 'gay'. I know none of them have ever gotten to know each other but we make assumptions on what somebody is like simply because of what we label them as. Every category has a default personality description and we think that's all we need to know.      Prep = bitchy, rich, white, ditzy, disrespectful, racist    Goth = depressed, weird, stupid, death obsessed, love black clothing, satan worshippers    Punk = freaks, stupid, posers, none of their clothes match     We automatically think these things, but once we get to know them, they are very different.   But in a society where we are force fed ideologies on these things, we discriminate.         I constantly think about things like that. Once you get to know me you'll be surprised at what goes on in my head. That is probably one of the reasons why I don't talk about these types of things with people my age. Most don't understand. Most of them are concerned with trivial things.    We waste our time debating over what brand of toilet paper to buy, what toothpaste to use, what brand of tissue paper we need to clean our snot with  (and it's not like the bugs in the trash can are like 'Dude! this is Puffs! not shitty Kleenex!!').   Capitalism!!!!    Don't ask how this all stemmed from talking about my boring old day. I'll continue some other day....now  a thought on DEATH.                   M  EN   fear death, as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other. Certainly, the contemplation of death, as the wages of sin and passage to another world, is holy and religious; but the fear of it,   as a tribute due unto nature, is weak.       "

1180,Cancer,"            The lost art of kissing    By William D. Hicks   Kissing plays an obvious and important role in romance. It’s often the first time many people know they’re in love — quickened pulse, butterflies, maybe even fireworks. But kissing seems to be a lost art form these days.   Ready to reclaim it? Anyone who masters these eight techniques to becoming a kissing master deserves a second date:  Towel off  Kisses are not meant to be wet. Sure, lips are intrinsically moist, but no one wants to kiss fish lips.     Moisturize   Lips that are dry or chapped feel like kissing sandpaper. Find a favorite lip balm and get into the habit of using it often.     Freshen up   If garlic and onions have to accompany every meal, make sure you carry breath spray or mints with you at all times. Excuse yourself before you start to pitch woo and give your breath a boost!     Shut up   First dates are not the place to practice your French kissing skills. While some people love to French kiss, others do not. It's way too intimate, and first dates should leave 'em wanting more.     Tantalize   Small, strategic kisses on the ears, lips and neck can be as effective — or more effective — than a long, lingering kiss that lasts a lifetime.     Be creative   Kissing is more than locked-lips; it can entail nibbling, licking and caressing someone's lips. You can also use your hands on their back, face, lips or hips to add an extra level of sensation to any kiss.     Focus   Concentrate on the kiss. Close your eyes and enjoy the sensation of lips on yours. Let your mind go; be in the moment.     Stop   No means no. If a date shies away from kissing on the first date, don't press the issue. Leave something to look forward to on the next date.          "

1182,Taurus,"       i choose itzli because its the name of the Aztec stone knife god, the god of sacrifice. Why?  Because there have been many sacrifices made these past years and many more to come.  3 days ago i had to make another one, i had to let go someone i truly loved.&nbsp;Amy was at first a friend, a very good friend and i cared for her. We were friends for 2 years and along the way somehow, she fell in love with me.But i didnt love her, not in that way. I was lost that time and i had no room for love or relationships. I was busy trying to get out of that hole i dug myself. But she waited for me.. in her own way  I had a good streak last year, i found forgiveness from my family, i found absolution. I found hope. I found a job at a music store, i had a home, i had a friend i could count on. I started to feel good about myself and i didnt have to force myself to smile. I stopped wanting to run away.Then i met Rini, first i found her annoying but then her bubbly cheerful personality became contagious. I enjoyed it when i was around her and she enjoyed being around me. She was beautiful, radiant, energetic,intelligent. she was an art school girl as well..heh. I fell in love, could you believe that? But she was still in love with her ex.And she was afraid of my past.&nbsp;Man that hurt. hurt so bad i had to cut myself in the bathroom. that was stupid. Really really stupid. I stopped seeing her all together the day she told me.  I was lonely after that, i was sad so i sought out Amy. I needed a friend. as always she was always there, always understanding and strong. she was my Sunflower. But somehow i could see she had changed the last time we met. There was something&nbsp;i recognized in myself&nbsp;in her eyes. It was sadness.  she had been drinking and partying aggresively, and she was doing drugs. She cut classes and her grades were falling. Something wasnt right. She questioned her purpose for being in school, for having to do all of it. I told myself i would be there for her.I didnt want her to make the same mistakes i did.&nbsp;Everytime she looked at me, everytime she dropped those hints, i knew it, i knew she was in love, with me. Those sad eyes.. Then i did something unthinkable. I told a girl i didnt love that i loved her. I lied. I closed my eyes and i clenched my teeth and i lied.&nbsp;That did the trick, she got better,she went back to class, she&nbsp;was happy. I made her happy. it felt good.We took care of each other, we made each other happy, everything was daisy picture perfect.Along the way i fell in love, completely and utterly.Its when you close your eyes and you see that one special person.It was her face. It wasnt Rini's face, it wasnt Emma's face, it wasnt any others but hers.Then i remembered my&nbsp;task. My future, my life.&nbsp;I was broke, working at a music store and i had no&nbsp;future. I wanted to go back to Uni and finish what i started, get a career. it got to me, i began to worry again. It tore me up inside for not being able to give Amy things, sometimes i couldnt even afford to buy her icecream,the only thing she ever asked from me..But she never complained.Bless her.(never have a girlfriend if you are poor, NEVER)I tried and i tried but nothing came up. I was sad again but i didnt give up. I couldnt.  Looking back&nbsp;perhaps it was my fault, i shut down on&nbsp;her and maybe thats what drove her away.She told me she only loved me for me. I didnt&nbsp;believe her and i was right.She wanted more and i couldnt give it to her in time. but i understood it,god i understood it though i wish i didnt and i could just hate her.. and now she's in australia doing her final year in pyschology and dating&nbsp;this guy who's studying art too. ironic isnt it.&nbsp;heh at least i achieved what i wanted in the first place, to make her better, to make her happy.i cant do anything for her now, its up to her to choose whats right and whats wrong and i believe she will do just fine.  and me? i'm still here,alone again&nbsp;but i havent lost hope on myself yet. so here's looking at&nbsp; you Zul, good luck and god speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;p/s dear god please cut me some slack        "
1183,Capricorn,"                 I'm getting sick of the word hearty. The last time I wrote a 'Hearty Recommendation' post, I said the word reminded me of a plump, red-faced gentleman with a lopsided top hat.

1187,Leo,"             and then there's the realist in me... i know it would never work, i haven't even seen her in years... or spoken in over a year... if she's changed, i don't even know her anymore... if she hasn't changed, well, did i ever really know her? then there's the question that really irks me, why? why would i choose to fixate myself on her... is she the proverbial 'one that got away'? is that why i'm doing this? or is it something more like a chemical inbalance that i'm choosing not to treat...

1191,Gemini,"             I have to say, it's been a good day for Baseball. First, and  most importantly , the Yankees won again behind the great pitching of El Duque. It's amazing what good pitching will do for a team. The boys are on a roll and life is good!   Greg Maddux got his 300th win today. Good for him. I don't mind the Cubs winning. It's kinda cool to be able to watch Nomar play for a decent team. I'm glad he's out of Boston so I can root for him, not against him. (Unless they get lucky enough to face New York in the series this year, of course.)    Speaking of the Yankees next opponent in the series, right now it looks like St. Loius is the best in the N.L. They don't seem to have any weaknesses. Now Larry Walker is a Cardinal. What are they trying to do, score 15 runs a game?    And what's up with Texas? Losing twice to the Orioles. I don't really like Texas. I'm just in support of any team that will keep Boston out of the postseason and they are currently ahead in the wildcard. I don't think my heart could take another Yankees/Sox postseason series.          "

1196,Leo,"       As the title suggests I had a great weekend, I'm just sorry that it had to end. I wont go into all the specifics but I hung out with bunches of friends and family and even saw La Plebe play at the Phoenix Theatre in Petaluma. I got to see my friend from the good ol' state of Oregon and her twins. I think of the twins, Charlotte, is starting to like me but Maggie still seems pretty wary of me.   I got to see two parades this year, Vallejo and Benicia's. I think I can say without too much hometown bias that Vallejo's was the better of the two, although both shared quite a few floats. I have a feeling that is the reason that Benicia has it's parade on the third, because if it did it on the fourth many of it's floats would be in Vallejo. Benicia's after parade festivies beat Vallejo's handsdown though. In Vallejo the Vallejo symphony plays after the parade and there is like a mini-crafts fair. In Benicia there is literally dancing in the street as a rock band plays various other bands hits. I saw no crafts booths, but there were a few food stands. There is one thing that Benicia is missing and that is a Ducky Durby. I know I bought a duck from a person in Vallejo's parade, thought I didn't go to the actual race. Maybe my duck won, that would kick so much ass. I would even love to get fourth place....hmmm, I don't know what happened to my duck ticket though, well they have my name and address.   Well, this was a great weekend and I'm glad that I got to spend it with family, old friends, new friends, and people that are just becoming friends. If every weekend were like this life would be grand and almost any lame ass job would be bearable because I would know that I had the weekend and great friends and family to look forward to.

1197,Aries,"       Finally got around to installing linux (fedora core2) on the laptop - it is working quite well, I even have wireless networking going on it, using the Netgear WG511 card I bought a while back - Nice :)  Also have the bare bones for 2 new systems - one dual PIII 1Ghz and one dual PIII 866.  The second one will be donated at cost to Mr. Irwin who has been good enough to drive me around the whole time and populate my apartment :)  The other will be my default file/web/whatever server on my home network.  Since it has RAID capabilities I should be able to come up with a nice fast machine :)  Haven't decided what to run on it yet - BSD or Linux......Fedora doesn't seem too bad so far, gentoo is a possibility if I'm bothered putting the time in, then BSD is as stable and secure as it gets, hmmmmmmm...  Anyways - back to watching the basketball, after seeing England go down to France tonight, a Pistons win would be the icing on the cake :)         "
1198,Cancer,"       in a moment of clarity i looked up the tablature for 'tightrope', by the stone roses. a truly beautiful wonderful song, and one that i have every intention of playing at some point when the mysterious 'band' gets together. acoustic singalongs were never so cool:  are we etched in stone,  or just scratched in the sand waiting for the waves to come  and reclaim the land?   and then, in a moment of complete insanity, i looked up the tablature for 'good times', by the stone roses. why? delusions of adequacy, and nothing more. oh my good god, there is no way i will ever ever learn to play that. [aside: i probably could, but it would need to be a full-time job and i'm fairly sure no-one's going to pay me for that, alas.] i get as far as 0:26 and then its into the main riff and i've no space to fit all those notes in.   it brings up the issue of 'the second coming', though, which is a vastly underrated album in my opinion. to have those two completely different songs next to each other and to have it work is an indication of something, even if five years is a long time to wait. definitely worth having; good summer guitar tunes. disregarding the rain, that is.   interesting fact: on the set of '24 hour party people', i met the fake john squire - that is, the actor playing john squire in the film. and yet, he doesn't appear in the film at all. shame; he had good john squire hair. presumably left on the cutting room floor...  n.

1199,Capricorn,"                 I’m so disgusted with Hollywood. Besides Planned Parenthood and John Kerry, it seems like the one of the greatest evils in America. I like seeing movies in the theater. I check different Christian movie review sites, and look for something our family could go see together, but it’s very rare when something comes up. It’s not just because my parents wouldn’t allow me to watch them, but I myself wouldn’t feel comfortable watching them anyway. Many of them sound funny or interesting, but they are fatally marred with violence, gore, sexual content, coarse jokes, and bad language. In many cases, the plot could be good, but the added content makes it highly objectionable. I suppose to some extent, it’s good. Not because the content is good, but it makes our family watch less TV and movies in general, I think, and read more. That’s always a good thing. Unfortunately, I fear that’s not the case with other Christian families. A poll in Plugged In showed that many Christians do watch R rated films.       "

I finally found a wifi card that works with my laptop, the  urlLink   Netgear MA401   , I had one where i work that we use to get laptops on the internet to do updates and stuff when they don't have a NIC card, a USB port(for a usb nic), an O/B ethernet port, or when we don't have an open cat5 cable to plug the laptop to. So I tried it, & what da you know it worked. So i went to compusa after work and spent more money....being a geek is so expensive.

1202,Gemini,"           Last week I told myself to get started on doing some spring cleaning. I cleaned out the boot of my car. The  urlLink wardrobe  beside my bed. And I'm currently working through cleaning out my celebrity infatuation list. The other day I consoled myself with the fact that a relationship between  urlLink JJJ  radio announcer Myf Warhurst and I can never work out. Today I've dealt with the fact that a relationship with Norah Jones would be built too much on my desire for her as a performer and not as the beautiful butterfly that she is.  Much like the rest of society, I've developed quite a love affair with the music of Norah Jones. It is perfect to listen to in the background while surfing the net, driving my car, and spring cleaning celebrity infatuations. Despite listening to her first album more than any other CD I've ever bought, I'm still not sick of it. And honestly, I'd be a little lost without it.  Which is why the relationship would never work.   First of all, can you imagine the pressure that would be put on the relationship if, while driving the car, I put on her record. While she may be cool with it once or twice, there's no way she'd be interested in regularly listening to her own release. The only solution would be for me to not listen to the CD again. And quite frankly, I just feel morally opposed to putting any woman between myself and the art I adore.  And oddly, this is a statement I make while an mp3 of Turning Japanese by The Vapors is playing on my iTunes.  The second hurdle in this would be my own sense of necessity to make use of my available resources. I love going to live  urlLink gigs  to see musicians. Why listen to the CD if I have the artist at my disposal? It'd be a continual effort for me to get her in my passenger seat, crooning away while I drive down to the shops to get a carton of milk. But why stop there? Everytime I walk into a bookstore, or a coffee shop, I hear Norah's album Come Away With Me being piped through the speakers (heck,  at times I suspect her record sales may be based purely on bookstore/coffee shop purchases alone). Instead of just listening to that, why not get Norah herself to sing as I search the store looking for one of the several Gregory Macdonald books that still elude me?  Sure, if one day I find that Norah Jones is knocking on my door. I won't be turning her away. But I know that the relationship is just not meant to be. And for that, I'm wiping her from my celebrity infatuations list. Farewell Jones, Norah. Next up: Mathis, Samantha.         "
1203,Sagittarius,"       She met him over meat: five pounds more than she could eat. He came to her because he could not believe a woman could order so much meat. And  when he saw her, so petite, he yearned to find where she had hid her meat. He met her  every day he could to convince her he was more than good. And when he kneeled to ask her hand, he promised  he'd give her the finest lamb.         "
1204,Leo,"                 Yes, I am still alive.  I have been living at the library--I spent 12 hours there three times last week.  Isn't that sad?  Of course the entire time was not spent studying--I get distracted rather easily be email or IM or random things I decide I just  have  to look up online (like study guides for next semester or new songs to download or directions on how to grill a steak {even though I don't have a grill!}).  But anyway, the point is that I have been busy preparing for finals.  I have 8 days until my first, so I will probably be MIA a lot this week.  I will try to post a longer message tomorrow.

1211,Gemini,"       Today is a pretty average and mundane day.  These are usually the best days for me, because I 'zone out' and start daydreaming.  (Just a little sidenote), it's amazing how when I daydream, it's almost as if I'm not physically present where I am and then it takes an outside distraction to bring me back to where I am.  Some people may think that's weird, but I see it as an awesome way to escape the daily pressures of life, rather than doing something that may be harmful to me or someone else.  Also, what I've found to be the most beneficial is how I've been able to generate ideas, accomplish feats that I didn't know that I could and also, at times, live out my dreams.    However, something that I've learned recently that may end up being a quantum leap for my life is writing down my thoughts or dreams.  Being able to come back to a previous thought and refer back to it at a later time, perhaps after acquiring more knowledge and skill can be a very powerful combination.  That's really my whole point for establishing my blog.  I've come to the conclusion that if no one ever reads my blogs, but me, that's okay, because in doing this I'm benefiting in several ways.  Firstly, I'm establishing a habit in doing something that I enjoy, which is writing.  Secondly, I'm developing content that can be utilized later for something that maybe marketable.  Thirdly, I'm overcoming my apprehension of putting information out there for others.  I guess I've always felt that no one would really be interested in what I have to say anyway.  It's kind of ironic that I think that, because I love giving public speaking engagements and I love songwriting.  I guess I take writing and sharing my knowledge and experience as being something that is very personal or almost even sacred.  But what I've found, is that is what most people like about me.  My ability to express thoughts or experiences in such a way that they themselves feel like they're experiencing or thinking it.  One thing that I strive to do with my life, is to  do whatever I do with my heart and if I'm unable to do that then I quit and move on.          "

1214,Aquarius,"           I'll bet some of you are wondering, among other things, where exactly does Snowflake get the money to do all of his work. Well I can tell you this much, certainly not any government! I use my power for good and for the preservation of freedom; governments use power to aggrandize existing power and for control. The majority of my funding comes from corporations, most of which I started myself (I was quite the inventor in my day). My first claim to multi-trillionaire fame came about from what some think (especially women) to be my greatest invention: The Ultimate Hair Setting Lotion. There are several different types of lotions, one for each style (I was able to make a killing off the signature brands, e.g. Ultimate Halle Berry). You simply wash your hair and apply the lotion. Your hair is now permanently set until you wash the style out with a special reversal lotion. If you mess it up or sweat it out, simply wash your hair again with normal shampoo and your Ultimate Hair Style returns. No more going to the shop and getting your hair 'did' and 'redid.' You get your hair did right at home. When you want to go natural again, you can use the Ultimate Hair Style Reversal Cream to get your hair 'undid' taking it back to its orginal form. Wonderful, isn't it? The typical style lasts about 6 to 7 months before it starts to wear out. Some of the more exotic styles last only 3 months.  One hair style sold for about $50. The reversal cream sold for about $25. I sold some 300 million styles in the first year. FYI, this was not my most profitable invention.          Snowflake out ...     "

1216,Aquarius,"              Abu Dhabi:    I kept an eye out for the Arabian Sea even as we flew over the craggy, bald mountains of what I thought was a bit of western Pakistan under the blazing noon sun. The projection screen set up for the entertainment of passengers on the Gulf Air flight from Kathmandu to Abu Dhabi, kept warning of the searing heat outside, while some fellow passengers curled up in blue blankets of airlines issue. The sense of unreal that struck me at that moment kept recurring throughout our whistle-stop visit to Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah. As we approached the city of Abu Dhabi, the bleakness of landscape was punctured only by what appeared to be whimsical attempts at block building. Postage-size smudges on the endlessly stretching sand, looking more like rubbed-out sketches of a child, suggested human attempts at habitation. All this however changed the moment, our aircraft taxied into the Abu Dhabi terminal. We were met by a bevy of smartly attired women in slanting caps brandishing walkie-talkies. A neatly primed up gentleman with pronounced South Indian accent in his English, guided us through the duty-free shopping zone.  The 12 of us who had flown from Kathmandu to Abu Dhabi, courtesy Gulf Air on a familiarisation trip, were soon overwhelmed with the attention and sleekness of the airport and its services that reflected sadly on our good old Tribhuvan International Airport. After a bite of superb dates and better coffee, we were shown around the marvels of the famed duty-free area. One of the marvels included a million dollar scratch-and-win opportunity for a lucky traveller who succumbs to the charms of shopping there. The more practical ones amongst us quickly latched on to a bottle or two that were clearly cheaper by about Rs 400 to Rs 500 per litre than the going price in Kathmandu. To the utter disbelief of our liberal Nepali friends, who found it out a bit too late, liquor could only be bought in Abu Dhabi city if you have a licence and are lucky enough to locate an outlet.  Soon the 90 per cent humidity and 44 degree Celsius heat drove away such impious thoughts.           "
1217,Gemini,"           People often criticise the US television stations for buying the rights to British comedy series and remaking them. But the way I see it, it could be worse. Consider Are You Being Served In Australia.  Doesn't seem so bad, does it?  The problem is that when you're taking a comedy from one country to another, the comedy stylings just don't quite work. Note the current US remake of the show Coupling. And it's a shame, because the remake almost works. Almost.   So, what's the deal?  Well, it's exactly the same as the UK version. There's a few alterations to the script, but most of the dialogue and scenes from the first episode of the UK version are redone with US accents. The script is even credited to the writer of the UK version, Stephen Moffat. And, honestly, some of the rewrites actually work much better than the original episode. For those of you who don't know, the show revolves around a couple starting a relationship, their two best friends, and their ex-partners. It's just like Friends, except with lots of smut. Oh, and it's funny.   Who's In It?  Basically, its a big bunch of unknowns. The only cast member I recognised was Rena Sofer (who had a semi-recurring role in Ed). The show runner is former Cheers writer Phoef Sutton. It's a shame that the damn thing wasn't casted better as that's where the fault lies completely. Rena delivers her lines satisfactrily, but the other actors have no idea what to do. Their hands gesture wildly, and its almost like watching a sitcom from the early 50's where it was treated akin to a stage show. It causes the series to come off highly ameteurish.   So, what happens in the crucial first episode?  Well, we meet everyone. Steve meets Susan, and the rest all sort of interact in the background. It culminates in a resturant where they all watch Susan show them her right breast.   But is it any good?  Not really. I quite like the UK series for all of its faults, which I think has to do with a reasonably charismatic cast. The US casting has been horrible. NBC are looking at the series to work as a replacement for Friends when that concludes its run at the end of the next season. Part of the success of Friends was that the ensemble all clicked together relatively well. The pilot is worth a watch if only for a lesson in how to almost succeed in remaking a series.            "

El mundo exterior se desvance a cada instante y huyo a la oscuridad.   The pain I submerged deep in my heart screamed and was revived. For all that is precious, I won't turn away from pain any more. The town sinks into blue darkness and a sigh that entraps the wind knocks on the sleepless window. Alone, I wander around in the deep maze. A faint hope, withered flowers... The swirling flames drive me mad. A dark moon engulfs me.  I can't sense anything as it tears my body to shreds and takes me away, deep into the waves. Shards of glass, sinking into your cold stare. Far away, I hear it: a sign of daybreak. Then, in the darkness I see the ruins. The place deep in your heart where tears are born is where the answer sleeps:To keep its eternal beauty, the tragedy happens night after night.  ...At the end of the tunnel is a dazzling world.

1228,Pisces,"        - issue: indymedia, short form art, microcinema -    Have you seen any short films?  Very many short films?  I've been increasingly interested in short forms.    I wrote a ten minute play last year that was produced here at Malone -- and I've written several more this summer.  (early drafts yet.) i'm pretty excited about  urlLink flash fiction ... i think the music video more aptly gets at the experience of contemporary existence than most other extant forms (eg. maybe the music video is the new great american novel).  i'm watching the short films on  urlLink triggerstreet  and a couple of other places, and i wrote a treatment for a short film about a mucisian who is obsessed with writing the perfect short (one minute) song.  The perfect one minute song (in my film) would be composed & performed in one minute.    The great difficulty as I see it -- is that these forms aren't / can't find an audience due to the deathgrip of the  urlLink media industries ...  part of me knows that i want it both ways.  my imagination about artists finding audiences is shaped by my understanding of MASS culture.  An artist hasn't  'found' an audience, part of me says, until they've 'made it big.'  On the other hand -- the global monopolies & economies of scale that the  urlLink BIG SIX  are perpetuating -- are much of what gives rise to this notion of fame = success.  Sometime I should blog about celebrity being a format by which this hegemony is perpetrated -- but for now i'm interested  not in critique but in redemption!  I -- as a consumer -- as a human being -- as a fellow artist -- as someone who is moved by art -- want a way to access these forms of indymedia.    specifically, now, i'm refering to short films (though many of my thoughts translate well to the other forms).   I can watch short films at work (with some justification since i teach about these subjects) -- but not too many or too often -- and DSL service is expensive & if only DSL-ers should get to watch indymedia (/short films) than doesn't indymedia become an even more elitist, self-referential enterprise?   So that's why i'm excited about the idea of  urlLink microcinema .  and i'm excited enough about it to do something about it.  to try to start a  microcinema here in middle eastern OHIO.  but of course this is a back burner.  and my front burners are fairly demanding right now.  if you're a local reader (and most of you aren't) i'd love to hear how interested you'd be in volunteering to keep a microcinema organization up and running -- how regularly you'd support it (by coming)...what you think the major barriers would be...  heck I'd be interested in hearing that from non-local-ites...too...  part of me suspects that i should have as many blogs as i have 'back burners' but that'd be more fragmented -- and my goal in this blog is -- i think to be more unified.  so that means that many of you aren't so into indymedia rants...but others of you aren't so into news about the kids...this is like having a debate inside of your head -- in public.   peace~    "

1233,Aquarius,"                  I have four cats because.... I am insane?&nbsp; no.... Because I wanted them? partially.&nbsp; Ok here is the story.&nbsp; I have 4 cats because of one cat and a boyfriend who don't get along.&nbsp; Somehow along the way, my precious Winter became terrified of my boyfriend, Brian, after we moved in together.&nbsp; He started shitting in places he wasn't suppose to as well as peeing. It got in his fur, in my closet etc. It made my life hell for 3 months. I had to lock Winter up in a cage.&nbsp; Me and Brian moved into a 2 bedroom apartment in February. Winter got his own room. Winter was still terrified and doing all those bad things even though he could hear Brian but couldn't see him.&nbsp; So, I thought that getting another cat would help.&nbsp; Well, I couldn't find a place who would not call my Landlord about having another cat. So I went to the vet and they were selling 2 cats for the price of one. They were littermates and just under a year old.&nbsp; I took them because I wanted something and if this is all I could get, I would take it.&nbsp;    Winter got immediately better.&nbsp; Brian's attitude towards cats improved by 100%.&nbsp; Then a few months later, I got an email from a friend saying he knew someone who wanted to get rid of their black persian.&nbsp; I couldn't resist since a black persian was my dream cat.&nbsp; Now I have Winter, Midnight, Jasmine and Jayma.&nbsp; My least favorite is Jayma because she beats up the cats to the point where she is vicious. She breaks things and shreds on things. She begs for food all the time.&nbsp; She is annoying. I wouldn't mind getting rid of her.&nbsp; The two kittens are compulsive over eaters.&nbsp; They eat so much that I had to have set feeding times for them. When they don't have food to eat, they like to eat things that are not food and they chew on wires.&nbsp; It is annoying. They are extremely obese. My two persians, Winter and Midnight, are so precious. They play together and have fun. They are so beautiful that it takes my breath away. I really love those two cats alot.&nbsp; I would be torn up if anything ever happend to them.    So that is the story of why I have 4 cats instead of just two.&nbsp;          "
1234,Virgo,"       Let me tell you a little story. So I invited Sobic to my churches festival, Seton Funfest. Her reply; 'Oh, I've seen those signs around and I made funny of them. I thought it was Satan Funfest.' She comes despite the hilarious name mix-up.  Funfest was starting to drag after we bingoed our butts off and won nothing, ate food, and scan for hot guys but got no return looks. The search for boys was fun despite its massive failure. We were the hunters searching for prey. Hell, we even made up hand signals. They were pretty simple as far hand signals go. We just held up the number of fingers as there were hot guys. Example: two hot guys, two fingers. We had plenty of sightings.  One of our firsts was a redhead standing by the napkins. We walked around some more and came back. He was still there by the napkins so were go and watch the band at the tent he walks from his napkin spot over to us and... just stands there. He lingers for a minute and turns back to his napkins. Weird. Then we ditch Funfest for the ever exciting Omega and get some ice cream. 'This seems to be a vicious cycle,' Sobe says. 'We look for boys; we can't get boys, so we eat ice cream.' Subsequently, we go to Wal-Mart to see if Hanus is working, but we can't find him so we go to Target. It was 9:54pm and Target closes at 10:00pm. I walked up to the door and waited for it to automatically open. 'What the hell?' I shout, 'I still have six minutes.' Then I make a very important observation: the door was not automatic. Ops. We walk in and I grab the Notebook, which an awesome movie but I hear the book is ten million times better.  Anyway, we leave but we still have an hour to kill so we do what pretty much any teenager has done or will do; we go cruising. After about a half hour of cruising we decide enough's enough and we head home. We're going down Grange but we want to go through the new round-a-bout they have just put in. 'Lets just go around and around,' I say. So the windows are down, our music is playing and Sobe and I are in my PT Cruiser going around and around. Suddenly, Sobic says to me, 'Um Brown. There's a cop.' 'Oh, Shit,' I say and quickly exit the round-a-bout, police car follows with its light blinking. 'Uh, does he want me to pull over?' 'Yeah, I think he does.' I turn of the music and pull the car to the side of the road.  It seems to take him forever to get out of the car and come to the window but he does and he has his little flashlight and is shinning it in our eyes. 'Hello Ladies,' he says, 'Are you lost?' 'No.' We shake our heads. 'Oh, you just don't know how the round-a-bout works then?'      'Um, no. We know,' Sobic replies. 'We just being silly and going around some,' I smile sheepishly with my hands clutching the steering wheel. 'Do you have a license?' He says to me. 'Uh, yeah. Right here,' I say handing it to him. 'Okay, I'll be right back. Wait here.' We wait as he walks back to his car. As soon a he closes the door, I freak out. 'Oh my god, Sobe! I'm going to get a ticket; my mom is going to kill me.' Sobe just holds up one of her fingers, the signal for a lone 'hottie.' 'I can't believe you!' I shout, pause, 'Yeah, okay. He seems pretty cool, too.' Hot Cop comes back with his little flashlight. He hands me back my license. 'You Ladies didn't do anything wrong,' he says, 'I was just wondering what the hell you were doing. It looked so weird to see you just going around and around.' 'Okay Officer, we won't do it again,' Sobic says and we go home laughing the entire way. Oh man, I can't believe that happened. My very first pull over and it was the funniest thing EVER!     "
1235,Aquarius,         urlLink   
1236,Aquarius,"                 Today is our seventh wedding anniversary. It's just unbelievable how quickly the time has flown by. Like they say, time flies when you're having fun! I can honestly say they have been the best 7 years of my life, and I am looking forward to spending so many more years with the man of my dreams! We were chuckling tonight about the many eras we've been through. We've grown into adulthood together and it's been such a ride! I wouldn't have wanted to share it with anyone other than Ked! After dinner, I was finishing up a project for the trip with Cession and I asked Ked to put in some music for me. He asked what I wanted and I said, 'Something that will keep me awake. I'm exhausted!' He replied, 'I know just the cd and it's probably the only one you know all the words to.' (I'm known for listening to a cd 100 times and still not knowing all the words.) As soon as it started playing I started laughing and was instantly whisked back to 10 months into our marriage. We had just moved to Grand Rapids, and in the process of moving I had fractured my foot. Never stand on the couch to get things off a shelf! Ked had just started working at RBC and I was stuck in the new apartment immobile and most of our stuff was still back in Nashville (Michigan). I spent the day sitting on the living room floor because we didn't have any furniture moved yet. I can't remember what I did all day, because the only thing I remember about that day was I only had one cd to listen to - World Wide Message Tribe. And I listened to it ALL day long. We laughed about that together and reminisced about the years gone by. Then we realized it won't be long - just 7 more years - and we will have spent half our lives together.  Today was an extremely busy day for me and I am exhausted! I started out early taking Ked to work and then running to the bank, the chiropractor, and doing the laundry and cleaning the place up and all before noon!! Then I spent THREE hours this afternoon at Office Depot copying, cutting, and collating this project for the Cession trip. And I forgot to take my cd player and headphones! My brain was fried by the time I left there and I was exhausted! The employees kept glancing at me sideways I'm sure wondering if I was ever going to leave!! Anyway, I'm very happy that I got it all done and it's packed away in my suitcase. Then after dinner Ked and I worked on my suitcases making everything fit. I've never packed for 4 weeks before! He's a master packer and thanks to him I didn't even have to sit on the suitcase to get it closed!  Well, I am soooo tired I am sure I will sleep really well tonight, which is good because I haven't slept well the past few nights. I'm not sure how much I'll be able to blog while I'm gone. I should have access at the in-laws and at my parents house. Unless I run into a random open signal in Traverse I'll probably be off all next week. But hey, you never know! I found an open signal in Anchorage!               "

1243,Gemini,"        Hey!  Something new to me!  I decided to finally pick up a comic book mini series... Now, I have not collected a book in over 15 years & I used to be 'big' into collecting Marvel...  The new comics just did not appeal to me.  A lot of the new art just looks slapped together to me.  Oh well... I decided to pick up the limited edition series DC/Marvel cross over, it's 4 issues!!!  JLA vs Avengers!!!  Let me just say I was pleasantly pleased!!!  Woah!!!  Rocks hard core, reminds me of the old Marvel 'Secret Wars' story line...   I will not spoil any of it, but it was very well drawn & written!  Check it out if your remotely interested in comics.            "
1244,Gemini,"        Nothing is as unpredictably horrifying or as eagerly welcomed as a storm. Workers and animals flee in fright and seek shelter under the smallest branch – lovers and friends laugh up at the clouds, seeking solace in the arms of those closest. Hate it, Fear it, Love it, Study it – above all else, Respect it.   -------------------  The snow swirls outside my window, winds howl their woes to the trees and spirits of the land, clouds cover the skies with a dark shadow that both forebodes and invigorates. Oh would that I could be the Queen of the temperate winds and weathers. To be able to control such wonders would surely be a power worthy of this Queen. What say you? Some things should not be controlled? Nay, I’d not control it merely…work it to my will and convenience. From my fingertips would come streaks of lightening that would strike even the darkest corners of the land or the soul. Mine eyes, would seek out those who need avenging or romancing and do justice to their predicament. From my mouth would come the coolest winds to chill the heartless or the warmest airs to thaw any apprehension. My heart…my heart would be at the mercy of those who seek it out, protected by the best of all elements yet vulnerable because of them.   Days like this, I relish being the Queen that I am, I relish those whom I love as friends and family. I am thankful for all that I have, all that I am, all whom I have, all that I have been prevented from becoming.      Instead of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen, not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Tempestuous as the sea, and stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me and despair!           "
1245,Leo,"                 Well not exactly 2 years, 51 weeks I know.  I didn't want to do the math.  Anyway.  Yep, I'm alive.  I have almost survived my first week of law school.  It seems like a blur already.  I feel like I've been here for at least a month.  Things that just happened yesterday seem like they were days ago.  Here's what my week has been like:  Monday, 8:00 a.m.   Begin reading for first day of class.  Start with Torts.  Do not finish Torts until 6:00 p.m.  Eat dinner.  Start with Criminal Law.  55 pages of Criminal Law.  Go to bed at 2:00 a.m.  Do not sleep well.  Tuesday, 6:45 a.m.    Wake up, which isn't hard since I wasn't really asleep.  Feel sick.  Try to finish reading Crim.  Force self to eat breakfast.  Feel sick again.  Get dressed.  Leave house early.  Drive to campus, walk to class.  Wait for friend.  Feel really sick.  Panic about being called on.  Almost head to the bathroom to get sick.  Decide to get bottle of water instead.  Sit down in first ever law school class.  See little prof run around class talking about how important this first day is.  We are beginning our legal career.  How important our first class is!  He doesn't feel up to the pressure.  Cool guy.  Break for lunch.  Head back for Crim.  Feel sick again.  Crim teacher is rumored to be awesome though, so not as sick as earlier.  Crim teacher is awesome.  Feel lucky.  Make mental note to visit her office.  Survived first day.  Feel pretty damn good.  Think, 'hey, I can do this.'  Go home.  Begin reading for class next day (3 hours of Torts).  Eat gourmet dinner of PB&J and Kraft macaroni.  Go to bed at 2:45.  Sucks again.  Wednesday, 7:00 a.m.   Wake up, finish reading.  Worry about being called on.  Do not get called on.  Relief, although realizing it would have been better in the beginning when no one knows what's going on.  Although some people think they do.  They really think they do.  Be annoyed at this.  Very annoyed.  Worry that everyone is smarter, more organized, how on earth will I stay in top 1/3????  Call friend who just graduated.  Get reassurance.  Gossip.  Feel better. Try to start Crim reading.  Can't concentrate.  Try out library.  Can't concentrate.  Spend 3 hours on two cases.  Go home to watch American Idol.  And the Bachelor.  Feel guilty.  Read again, until 2:00.  Try to sleep.  Thursday, 7:30 a.m.   Wake up, finish reading.  Meet upperclassman to discuss Crim.  Get some real help.  Get his old outline.  Awesome.  Feel good.  Go to pointless Academic Skills class.  Get annoyed.  Regret signing up.  Hope it gets more relevant.  Read more for Crim.  Do not get called on.  Return phone calls during drive home.  Inform friends that car time now equals phone time because I can't be studying.  Decide to take power nap.  Phone rings 10 min later.  Return to library at 5.  Do Torts reading until 9:45.  Answer questions for friend.  Feel smart again.  Feel like it is getting easier.  Worry that I am missing something.  Go home, do some Crim reading.  Think about weekend.  Thank goodness.  Friday, 7:00 a.m.   Wake up, turn alarm off (it was set for 8:45).  Decide to clean kitchen.  Sit outside with dogs.  Finally post to blog.  Feel guilty.  Must return to reading.  I am too tired to think of anything funny.  After class today I'm taking a break.  No more law school tonight.  I'll resume that tomorrow morning.  There is a big SBA party tonight.  Should be interesting.  Hopefully I'll write more interesting stuff this weekend.  Just wanted to assure you I'm still alive.  And I don't feel like proof reading this, so if there are error please let me know.               "

1247,Gemini,"                 i can't wait for things to get moving, i want out of here. im lookin forward to uni although it means another 3 years in england. it should be so much fun from my experiences of it so far and my brother's experiences. after uni though it will be another year i guess before i can move, as i'll need to work for 'bout that long to get some money. will be quite lonely i imagine as every1 will have moved on by then. i wana work in a pub, duno why, not any pub, not a big pub, i'd love to work the fox n hound by jill's - it's small n friendly, i think thats what attracks me to bein a barmaid - every1 thinks its somit to look down on but what's so bad bein surrounded by people in a friendly (if smoky :s) atmosphere? mayb im naive... also hav a job lined up with jill i hope :) i love the sound of what she plans to do and she says she'll employ me :) ur pretty much self-employed to be honest so it should happen n im into herbal homeopathic stuff so sounds good for me. after that id love to work in italy or canada. i cant speak italian so that leaves canada lol. although i don't have enough points for a visa :( i hav a friend who's gona help me as he's canadian (thats gota help!) and if i end up workin for a whole year before i go then that shld give me more points, plus im gona try learn french alongside my psychology degree, i wana speak french newas but now i hav a goal for it and will give me more points the better at it i am. the biggest problem is probably death - i.e. getting in a plane... ive been thinkin bout takin a flight course to help me feel more prepared for flying, but i don't see how im gona erase the knowledge that it could crash - and if it does it's the worst possible thing to be in that crashes. i dont wana die. if i do, i dont wana die like that. but then more than not wanting to die, i wana live, i know wot i mean... which brings me onto the fact that i realy should start jogging again. i wana b able to do the 10mile fun run next year to raise money for something that keeps catching my eye, i seem to read about it in magazines n papers all the time, n things through the door, it breaks my heart, if there's nethin i can do i wana do it. not because im such a great person just because ive seen the effects.... newas...will b a new years resolution lol im pathetic camp america should be cool too, wish it was this summer though as im gona b bored outa my brain n probs comit suicide for somit fun to do...talkin of which my mum thinks im on drugs, seriously do i come across as that abnormal n screwed? i guess we just have different views on what's normal, what emotions n behaviour are acceptable, whats good for us etc. o well arrivedechi x      "

1249,Pisces,"             An extremely productive time was had at the Birdcage today as we came closer to wrapping up all the guitar overdubs. In fact, we might be done entirely if Brandt kept working after I left (though I doubt it). Regardless, the light at the end of the tunnel is growing brighter as we progress in large measures towards the mixing stage.  Like last week, I again stepped into the engineer's chair as Brandt not only re-recorded several guitar parts, but committed some new ideas to disk. I won't bore you with the details as it was a tedious but necessary task, but he started off doing some wonderful work in the rapidy evolving CREATION PHASE. The parts he wrote for this song are not simple, but the ease in which he lays them down would make you think otherwise. His attention to detail may be as tight as as Dan Hamill's anus, but it's worth it. Anyway, I think now we can finally put that tune to rest.  Next came the guitar lead for 1956. When the song was originally started in the aggression, Tom had done a riff which I thought was a good starting point for something that could work in the chorus. It was the usual Tom throwaway riff that he probably wasnt even paying attention to when he wrote it, and probably couldn't remember even playing. Anyhow, I remembered it and wrote my vocal melody to it. Realizing his riff wouldnt work as written, I took the extremely rare opportunity to pick up the guitar and re-write and perform the part myself. I'm happy to say my favourite two words: FULL SUCCESS apply here. I am under the impression that this is the only time I have picked up a guitar for this album, and this was the first guitar lick I have written since the verse leads for THE MOTIVE way back when. This worked out well and inspired Brandt to pick up his guitar to layer something over it. In a matter of minutes, the song went to a new level. Stay tuned!  Afterwards, we attempted to re-record Brandt's intro guitars to SOLAR, but I wasn't happy with the guitar tones he was working with. After some time, and much to my delight, Brandt decided to stick with his original recording from the demo and would fix the timing of it in Live to make it dead on perfect. I'm very much sold on that sound so Brandt, if you're reading this, don't change your freakin' mind. KEEP THAT PART...  Sometime during this, we had a special guest visit us in the form of Matt Gentile. As some of you may or may not know, Matt laboured many years as the aggression's manager and my original bass tech. I refer to him often as Mattagement. Thanks to him we've seen places and things on this planet the average rock band will never see or even dream of in their lifetime. He's the guy you call and say 'I wanna play some shows in Russia' and days later,  you're headlining major cities in foreign countries. Along with Dan Hamill, he is the co-conspirator of our MOG trips abroad and has never failed in his duties to us as a mattager or as a friend. I never question a thing when Matt is leading the charge and this had led the some of the greatest adventures of my life.  Anyway, he had some time to kill before seeing Morrissey's last night at the Apollo, so he came to listen to the new songs for the first time. It was good to have a fresh perspective on the material from someone who knows that the hell they are talking about. Because the aggression has gone the way of Suffolk County, Matt and I have existed soley on a friendship level this past year. However, I was excited to see him slip back into his professional mode and start discussing things like what the single should be, what song we should open gigs with and how we should have an EPK on the new CD. All great ideas.   I guess I should ask the handsome bastard to manage the Hype. Someone remind me, thanks. ;-)  I'm off to LA this week, so time is short and we're stealing as many moments as possible to make sure Brandt has everything he needs to work with in my absence. We're in good shape. The idea now is to be ready to mix the whole thing in JULY. I make note of this now to see when we actually DO start mixing someday.  In the meantime, say hi to your MOMS.

1254,Aquarius,"       Who would have ever thought that the Articles of Confederation were ratified in the year of 'dooky foot' or that the Constitution was ratified by a 'thug vibe' or that the Civil War happened during 'tough shit, chill!' There's a mnemonic technique called the Major System I discovered while over at the Wikipedia. It's a phonetic memory system used to convert numbers into words. Here's how it works:     0. s, z 1. d, t, th 2. n, ing  3. m  4. r  5. l  6. j, sh, ch, zh (like the s in vision)  7. k, g (hard - like the g in goat)  8. f, v  9. b, p  The vowels and h, w, and y are used as spacers so that you can spell words. Examples:      'dooky foot' = d _ k _ f _ t = 1  7  8  1 = 1781 (remember, only the consonants get counted)     'thug vibe' = th _ g _ v _ b = 1  7  8  9 = 1789     'tough shit, chill' = t _ f _ sh _ t - ch _ l = 1  8  6  1 - 6  5 = 1861-65    The possibilites are unlimited, but first you have to memorize the phonetic list. Hope this helps with your history.           "

Don't get me wrong, his room's still a mess, I get the eye roll at bed time, I still can't figure out how the water gets out of the shower when there are two shower curtains to keep it in the tub, etc., but he's become attentive, doesn't argue as much, accepts direction and finishes a project before moving on, I'm almost sad (I said   almost  ), I think he's growing up right before my eyes.  Mackenzie is my three year old and from my second marriage.  She is amazing to watch because she is so much like my husband and I, throwing back my own words at me can be sometimes hard to hear.  Her preschool teachers constantly tell me that sometimes they forget she's three because she articulates her thoughts so well.  She idolizes her big brother and he adores her, but they are brother and sister, and when that fact comes into play, it can be ugly.  David is home for the summer, school has been out for a couple of weeks now.  Mackenzie is in preschool three days a week, mornings only.  So today I had both kids home this morning.  David had day camp at school at 9:30 a.m, the same time Mackenzie had her swimming lesson across town (Mom didn't have her organizer with her when she scheduled this mess).  It therefore was imperative that we leave our house clean, dressed, and fed by 8:40 a.m.  No one wanted to get up, no one wanted to get dressed, no one liked my breakfast choices.  St. Vincent de Paul was coming by to pick up the remnants of the garage sale leftover for donation, and I needed to get that stuff out of the garage and leave it up front for them to pick up.  The dog and parrot both needed attention. And for some reason, today was the day my phones started ringing at 8:00 a.m.  David has pulled himself together and I ask him to get himself and his sister in the car.  Mackenzie is all over the driveway, running from flies (our newest fear) and not getting in the car.  David has made the valiant attempt and I tell him not to worry about it, I'll handle her.  At the precise moment he decides to swing the door closed, Mackenzie decides she better cooperate.  Her hand didn't get caught, there were no broken bones, but she did get some skin scraped on the edge of her finger.  She proceeded to cry about her finger for the next four and a half hours -- all the way to David's school (20 minute ride).  All the way to the YMCA (25 minute ride).  Through the entire swimming lesson (30 minute class).  Over to dad's office (20 minute ride).  At dad's office (a very quick ten minutes).  Back to pick up David (35 minute ride) and drop him off at a friends house (10 minutes).  (Now here I must interject the next piece of good fortune.  At dad's office, we utilized part of our visit in the bathroom, she is fully potty trained and I haven't carried a diaper bag or a change of clothes in at least six months.  As she went to the bathroom, I noticed she had what I'll call RB (short for Runny Butt, I'm sure you get the idea).  I'm surprised, she hasn't had RB in a while, and I'm chalking it up to the fact that she's made herself so upset this morning.  I've tried a variety of things at this point to distract her from her pain and get her to smile and nothing is working.)  After the friends house, I decide to take Mackenzie to a local park close to the friends house, thinking I won't have to make the big loop around when I pick David up in a couple of hours.  It was hot, so I decided to take Mackenzie to an ice cream store, counting on the sugar to give her energy at the park and make her happy and give Mom a break because the last nerve was about ready to blow.  She smiled.  Things were good.  Just as the ice cream got to the table, we had major RB.  She lost it again.  I haul her into the bathroom and survey the damage.  It couldn't have been much worse.  I had baby wipes but that was it, no change of clothes, no diapers or underwear, and she's screaming the whole time.  Chucked the underwear in the trash, not salvageable given my current situation. Washed out the pants from the inside, had her put them back on, and I slid baby wipes and paper towels around her bottom.  Cleaned up the bathroom as best I could.  Got my drink to go, left her ice cream (more screaming) and back home we went (25 minute ride).  Changed her at home, caught my breath for five minutes and back for David we went (25 minute ride).  Picked David up and now it was time to take him to his dad's house, he's there every Thursday (35 minute ride to dad's).  Poor David, he pretty much sucked up to his sister every time he saw her, and she still wanted nothing to do with him -- he tried singing to her, making funny faces at her, telling her jokes, I felt bad when he reached for her hand and tried to kiss it and make it better, she completely blew him off.  As I walked him to his dad's door, I told him not to worry about it, she'd be better tomorrow when he saw her.  Let's hope that wasn't an extreme stretch of the truth.  When kids have diarrhea, the things you worry about most is dehydration.  You've got to keep the fluids going down their throat, the idea is to get the fluids in faster than they come out.  Of course, the job is twice as hard when they don't want to take them in at all.  By 3:00 p.m., I was on my way to the doctor's office, she just wasn't right, the constant crying was starting to worry me even though it didn't sound like the pain cry, it was definitely the wimpy cry, but nonetheless, it was time.  And going in to it I knew there was no medicine I could give her, nothing to stop the RB, but I had to try something.  She blew twice while we were there.  (Thank goodness I picked up a change of clothes.)  While the doctor told me lots of stuff I already knew, he did mention something I didn't.  Since he figured out her particular case is viral, he said it would be contagious and adults could get the same thing, but in a much milder form.  Hmmmm, double extra hand washing for me.  Called the husband to tell him what was going on, and was told he had left a little early, had said he was feeling a little tired and run down.  Hmmmm, he hadn't mentioned that to me when I talked to him earlier in the day.  We got home, and there he was lying down on the bed, said he didn't know why he didn't feel so good.  I did.  Why do I direct this column at those stay at home parents?  Because this was one of those days that all these things were going to get done and not a darn thing got accomplished.  Now the health and well being of my child is paramount and my life can go to hell as long as my kids are OK.  But what was shaping up to be a good day fell apart so quickly.  My laundry is still on the floor.  The dishwasher is still loaded with clean dishes and the sink has dirty ones in it.  My kitchen floor is, well, let's not talk about my kitchen floor, OK?  My coupons are still on the table waiting to be cut and sorted and my bed didn't even get made this morning (but I don't think the husband cared when he came home and rolled into it) and I didn't even cook dinner today (again, not high on Keith's priorites right now).  I know I didn't do a damn thing today and I feel guilty and useless.  So it was a surprise when David called me from his dad's, to see how Mackenzie was feeling and to thank me for taking him over to his friend's house today.  And Mackenzie announced to her dad that she didn't want him right now, she wanted Mom because I had taken care of her all day.  I went to bed thinking I had done a good job for today after all.  And maybe if I get up extra early before she wakes up I can unload the dishwasher and fold the laundry, etc. And if she wakes up early, well then we'll just cuddle in Mom and Dad's bed for awhile.

1262,Libra,"       I have watched what I consider an obscene number of movies in recent times. Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban, Girlfriend (to satisfy the curiosity of my friend -- we walked out half-way straight into Harry Potter), Troy, Deewaar and Van Helsing in the theatre's. While Last Samurai, Master and Commander, Nine Months, Dial M for Murder, Matrix, The Insider, Schindler's List, Finding Nemo, Toy Story 1, Toy Story 2, Gladiator and The Full Monty have seen me hog the idiot box at home.

He will be leaving Norway on Sunday to Nanching which is on the south-east side of the country but not that close to sea.  Offcourse I offered Veigar to post some news of his travels on this great page but we have to see how well plugged he is.

I've known for a month, but not many have, because it has gotten near zero news coverage.  Even today, the Star Tribune (the local paper here) had merely a tiny article that was stuffed back in A4.  Fortunately, the amendment was defeated 58 to 50.  The House is scheduled to vote on the same thing next week.  In bad news, Virginia has passed a law that makes it very near impossible for same-sex partners to have contracts (like wills or child custody) with each other that heterosexual couples take for granted.

Twins born conjoined at the head are extremely rare, accounting for one of every 2.5 million births. Parasitic twins like Rebeca are even rarer.   I wouldn't want someone operating on me who uses the  non-word; 'rarer'.  :/  But, I guess if I only made $200/month, I would shut my fucking mouth, instead of having a 'franken-baby' with two heads - especially in some 3rd world country.  They're just as likely to burn her at the stake, as declare her some fucking God.     Rebeca is the eighth documented case in the world of craniopagus parasiticus, said Dr. Santiago Hazim, medical director at CURE International's Center for Orthopedic Specialties in Santo Domingo, where the surgery will be performed.  All the other documented infants died before birth, making it the first known surgery of its kind, Lazareff and Hazim said.

1271,Gemini,"          Ode to Mystery....     There is something precious in our being mysteries to ourselves, in our being unable ever to see through even the person who is closest to our heart and to reckon with him as though he were a logical proposition or a problem in accounting.  Rudolf Bultmann --   What happens to the hole when the cheese is gone?   Bertolt Brecht (whom I adore btw) ------   What am I, Life? A thing of watery salt held in cohesion by unresting cells. Which work they know not why, which never halt, myself unwitting where their Master dwells?  John Masefield ---------   It is the dim haze of mystery that adds enchantment to pursuit.   Antoine Rivarol -----------   Mystery has its own mysteries, and there are gods above gods. We have ours, they have theirs. That is what's known as infinity.  Jean Cocteau --------   Secrecy is the element of all goodness; even virtue, even beauty is mysterious   Thomas Carlyle (another fav.) ---------  Therein lies my ode to Mystery, to the element that continuously suprises me on a daily basis. Discoveries are made within ourselves and within others and sometimes with those others helping you. Mysterious feelings are the truest form of our most honest selves, makes us face who we are inside and who we pretend to be on the outside. It forces us to acknowledge parts of our minds we'd rather hide away, forces a reaction the smallest detail we'd sooner ignore..fear, uncertainty, hatred, sorrows and hurt. It also brings on the purest forms of joyful revelations, the deepest seeds of the most radiant love, a rapt awe in discovering a 'self' thought previously lost or destroyed.  Having a mystery revealed is like picking a beautiful flower from a shrub...the pleasure in it is immeasurable, you know at last what it feels like, smells like..mystery solved..but it will die shortly - leaving behind nothing but a memory of a time wondered about. However...as always...another mystery soon grows to captivate and stimulate our senses and we are thrown into the pulpit of emotion again with a mixture of jubilation and despair.   Do I want my mysteries solved or enhanced? Or perhaps do I want them solved and added to? Oh Fie! Even that is a mystery and I love it so!           "
1272,Taurus,"             Horray for having the same days off as my roomates, finally! today was splendid - we started our morning with blackberry infused pancakes (need i say yum?) and then headed out to the Sooke Potholes, a 45min drive and 20 min hike away. It was glorious - the water was cool, but oh so refreshing, and when we came upon Crystal's favourite swimming spot, there was not a soul in sight... soooo nice, just us, the sunshine, and the water. But then, 2 minutes later a rather large group of people ambled down the path... sigh, so much for solitude - but what can you expect from such a divine swimming place? After swimming up the river aways and watching some boys jump off cliffs into the water (yikes - i just keep picturing my cousin with his lacerated spleen from landing badly off a 30 foot cliff a couple weeks ago), we swam back an prepared ourselves for some much needed sunbathing. (well that only lasted for a little while until we had to break open the food bag and munch for a while - mmmm more good food like samosas and veggies and trail mix, and crystal's homemade candied ginger, oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies!) It was a wicked way to spend the day. When we arrived home, it was time to check out some of the summer olympics - rowing and gymnastics to be specific (those gymnists can do some crazy shit i tell you). Then my good friend Oona came over and we got ready to go dancing at Steamers Pub where Velvet plays dance music with some funk every sunday night. Good times were had. All in all I'd have to say it was a pretty stellar day, obviously (sorry, but that's been the word of the day). :) But sweet dreams are awaiting me, and my eyelids are going on strike.... p.s.

I'm listening to that Carbon Leaf song.  I've been talking about it way too much this week.  Sorry.

Just in case I leave my sister's like you better cook for us.  I think I'm just gonna brown some chicken breast in olive oil and make some pasta.  Hell I like it.  And maybe throw together some Italian wedding soup. yum yum, bubble gum, in my tum, 'gimme some!'    I'm in such a weird mood today.

1277,Sagittarius,"        Oh, now its working   This morning I had wanted to write happy little thoughts about things that make me happy.  But the publishing tool for my blog wasn't working.  And now all the happy thoughts are gone.  Why, you ask?  Well, after not receiving any notice or money regarding the purge payments from my dead-beat-dad ex-husband.  I had been receiving both on a pretty regular basis up until the first week of November.  Then, nothing.  No little love notes from the state attorney's office telling me that he showed up for the court date.  No little envelopes containing the check that was keeping him out of jail.  It all stopped cold.  So, I called the State Attorney's Office for Child Support today.  First I had to hold for 20 minutes, then give the ritual information of name, social security number, current address, yadda yadda, ad naseum.  Then, I finally got to tell the nice lady that I just want to know what's going on.  She advised me that a warrant was issued for his arrest last month, when he didn't show up with the purge payment.    Of course, I have reservations about how this will affect my karma.  However, considering the guy is now unemployed and no longer contributing to the support of his children, I say let him serve his 45 days.  At this point, it makes no difference to me at all.    As long as I don't have to explain to my children why Daddy can't visit us for Christmas.  Diva out.           "

1280,Leo,"                 You would think that with my first final exam week approaching so very rapidly I would have lots and lots of things about which I'd be motivated to write.  Nope.  I just don't.  In fact, I don't feel motivated to do very much of anything.  It's almost 10 a.m., I have class at 2, and I don't feel motivated to do the reading.  I've found it quite hard lately do make myself do new reading when all I really want to do (school-wise at least) is study for exams.  I have two next week.  My first is a three hour closed book Criminal Law exam at 9 on Tuesday.  I pick up the second, a 48-hour take home Torts exam, at noon after the Crim exam.  The torts exam is due Thursday at 2.  I suppose that really gives us 50 hours.  I wonder how many of my classmates will sleep during that time.  We are going to be given 7-8 hypotheticals, each of which we are limited to 2 pages of discussion.  It certainly sounds like a lot--14 to 16 pages in two days, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to have a difficult time condensing everything to 2 pages per hypo.  If I don't answer my phone or return calls during that period, please don't be alarmed--not only am I not on the phone, I'm probably not eating, sleeping, or showering.  Well, I'm sure I'll eat and shower at least...not so sure about the sleeping though.  I guess we'll see.    I'm going to Boca Grande this weekend (my favorite place on the planet).  I just feel like I need to get away from here.  At home it's impossible not to get distracted, and even at the library everyone is around so it's difficult not to stop and chat.  I studied for the LSAT in Boca Grande, so at least I know I can do it.  You can't beat sitting at a table looking out at the ocean.  It's distracting, yes, but in a very calming way.  Plus, I have 7.25 hours of Criminal Law CDs to which I can listen during the drive and during any laying out I decide to do.  I won't feel guilty for wasting the time driving since I'll have those.  I'm pretty darn excited about it actually, and if we weren't having a review in Crim (and if I hadn't missed the max in Torts) I'd leave today instead of tomorrow.  But I suppose I can suffer through 3 more classes--how crazy, only three classes until my first semester is finished.  I know it's not a real semester--but hey, it's a start.  OK, enough procrastinating for now.  I've got to learn about solicitation.                 "

Last night some cretin, or more likely cretins, decided it would be lots of fun to throw empty beer bottles off the balcony.  From waaaaaaay up high.  At about 5:30 in the morning.  I didn't even know what the horrible glass-shattering was.  From under my pillow, it sounded like someone was bowling with beer bottles and getting strikes regularly.   I did finally get back to sleep for a little while, with an occassional score here and there interrupting my zzzz's.  When I got out of bed this morning, I went out onto my own terrace to see if I could find any trace of what exactly had happened.  I discovered on the rooftop two or three floors below me that someone had discarded three empty cases of beer.  So, what, that's like 36 beers?  And strewn across one section of the roof, probably directly below where ever they flew down from, were lots and lots of empty beer bottles.  Some were still entact, some were completely shattered.    Who, on a Tuesday night, can consume 36 beers?  And, why would anyone think it would be fun to toss them over the balcony at 5:30am?  Apparently, someone without work on Wednesday and without any consideration or common sense.    *Grrrrrr!  Diva out.          "
1284,Virgo,"   Another issue regarding the covenant of works is the extent to which it is still binding upon fallen man.  I have no doubt that all of mankind is commanded to be holy and righteous, always obeying God.  However, regarding the covenant of works, because it is broken--Adam and us in him breaking it--can we say that mankind is still  in  the covenant of works?  Are we still under the covenant of works, which demands personal, perfect, perpetual obedience?  If we are covenant breakers by virtue of being born--for we were in Adam's loins when he broke it, making us covenant breakers when we come into existence--then can we be  in  or  under  this same covenant of works?  I think it is safe to say that like Adam, as soon as he broke it, the covenant of works ceased to actually be a binding covenant in which he and we existed.  So, though a covenant of works does not remain binding all of mankind, the curse of it does.  Okay... how does that sound?  But what has that got to do with the price of beans in Brazil?  That simply means we cannot say of the unregenerate that he is under or in the covenant of works, demanding perfect and perpetual, personal obedience.  Rather, regardless of how 'good' he is, he is a covenant of works breaker, unable to earn his eternal life because he is not a member of the covenant of works, but a covenant breaker.  These are simply random thoughts I am putting down on paper as I reflect.  "

I can handle sore knowing it is going to go away WAY better than I can being sick 24/7.  The surgery went fairly well.  I have way more pain than I anticipated due to having adhesions all the way up to my gallbladder from the appendectomy gone awry.  And, when I came to in my room (having no memories of recovery room or traveling from point A to point B to point C) I was hurling, which is nothing new, I always do that after anesthesia.

Come to find out they tore something in my nose when they put the NG tube down it during the surgery and my nose had been bleeding the entire time down my throat.  GAH-ROSS!  And scary to see coming up!  Thanksgiving dinner was good for everyone else!  I wasn't able to eat more than a couple of bites that day.  And that was only white meat turkey, green beans, some sweet potatoes and roll since I am on a low-to-no fat diet for a while.  But, I'll gladly sacrifice this Thanksgiving because now I know that the rest of them will be enjoyable.  This morning I started sneezing.  That wasn't a lot of fun.  I think I popped a few stitches loose before I got it under control.  OUCH!  I may have also invented a few new words.  My belly button is some rather interesting hues of blue and black and green.  There are 5 lovely new soon-to-be scars added to my collection.  And the worst thing?  I can't drive for at least 2 weeks!  ARGH!!!!  Fortunately my mother is here to cart me and the chilluns around.  Especially since I can't pick anything up either.  Certainly not 32 pounds of wriggling, writhing Willabeast.  That child is a buncha handfuls.  So, I'm thankful for the help.  I will be glad to get my independence back though.           "
1287,Gemini,"        SEATTLE — Evil — a word usually reserved for the likes of Adolph Hitler or Usama bin Laden — is now being used by more than a third of Canadian teens to describe the United States.   Well, looks like our neighbors to the north dont seem to approve of us anymore, shame, we used to get along so well, oh well, your beer still sucks (movie line, not a drinker myself)  The article goes on to say:   French-Canadians were even harsher, with 64 percent of them calling America a force for evil.     I don't know much about Canada, but arent French Canadians the low end of the totem pole in Canada? All the canadian jokes ive heard always seem to center around French Canadians.  More:   The anti-Americanism from the United States' northern neighbors seemed to peak when the Iraq war started.      No shit, really? I thought the World Community really loved us for invading Iraq. And damnit, where is my cheaper gas if we went in for oil!?!      In one incident, hockey fans in Montreal booed during the playing of the American national anthem.   Crazy Canadians, sure, that pisses me off, but hey, whatcha gunna do?   Well, thats all I for now, thanks for reading.     "

Especially when making (what should be) declarative statements like: 'I think we have to coordinate our efforts on the technical level, which would allow us to better assess the realities on the ground, to fight terrorism more effectively,' That qualifier (I think) strikes me as waffle-ish - he's leaving himself an out so that if someone disagree's with him, he can argue that he hasn't really said anything.

1300,Sagittarius,"       Now this one topic which has always got my attention, since I am just the type of person who is quite uncomfortable with the thought of making a commitment to someone whom I dont know well enough. This was a bit of a dormant topic, till yesterday, when I was watching this news cut on a news channel about Live relationships, and the gaining popularity of this concept among Indians.  I personally have always liked this concept essentially for the following reasons: 1.  Good check of compatibility under the same roof 2.  Easy transition to a commitment of marriage 3.  Better learning experience 4.  More quality time gets to be spent with your partner In all:  It gives you a chance to test out the waters before taking the Big plunge.  But then, are there negatives to this situation ??? Well, I can only think of the following: 1.  Things are taken for granted 2.  The relationship starts to be more driven by Sex, than that of an emotional commitment. 3.  People get into the mode where they take things for granted and forget to spend time with each other!  Funny but dont these negatives really sound more like the downsides of marriage? Hahaha...!  So whats the difference really! Well, as far as I'm concerned, Live In relationships is a commitment of a non legalised sense, essentially a marriage of two souls which aint on paper!  Well..some people can also see this in terms of Co habitation....kindof like a due diligence process which needs to be completed before the final jump!   Just curious but in this form of relationships...is the independent self maintained at all???          "

1303,Libra,"       Silly question, no? Well, kind of. Let me explain....  I am getting a scooter. It will help a lot with the fact that I cannot walk long distances anymore. I am able to do a lot more during the day and I am less tired at the end of the day. I have the image of that muppet character  urlLink Scooter , the original orange geek! And I can't help wondering whether I look as geeky as I feel when I am 'scooting' down the street at four miles per hour.  But I realized there are three kinds of people:  1)  The people I know whose opinion I respect  -- these people will generally be supportive of the stuff I have to do;  2)  The people I know whose opinions I do not respect  -- these people will probably also be supportive (though I do not really care as much!  )  3)  The people I do not know  -- I honestly do not care at all what these people think. If I piss them off when I am crossing the street then I am happy to do it as the sort of person to be mad at handicapped pedestrians with the right of way deserve to be frustrated in as many aspects of their life as possible.  It does make things easier, and frankly I feel dumb for not just doing it sooner. But it takes time to accept the limitations under which one suffers. I should be glad that I am looking at it now rather than years from now!    "

1317,Sagittarius,"        I'm just a girl  Sometimes I forget that.  I had visions of grandeur this weekend as I walked through the aisles of the discount auto parts store.  I thought, 'I can do this!'  I wanted to save money so I figured I could put oil and coolant into my car, change the air and oil filters, and pick up a steering wheel cover while I'm at it.  When I could barely get the damn cover to stretch over my steering wheel, having to pry my finger from between the cover and the wheel, I should have known I was already beaten.  What the HELL was I thinking?  I ended up forgoing the oil filter when I learned that I would need a special tool.  I tried to figure out where the rectangular air filter went in my engine, but I just couldn't do it.  On my old 70-something Toyota hatchback there was a big round space indicating where to put the filter.  My 98 Nissan isn't quite so revealing.  And for my final act, I put 2 quarts of oil and an oil additive into my engine.  Harmless enough, right?  Well, add that to the oil already in my engine (running very low but still in there) and the 2 quarts I added last weekend, and - ladies and gentlemen - we have a recipe for DISASTER!  I cranked up my car, gripped the squeaky new steering wheel cover between my fingers, and proceeded out of the garage for a Saturday night on the town.  Then, I noticed a black plume of heavy smoke being belched out of my exhaust.  It was so bad that the maintenance guys in my building came running, they thought the building was on fire.  Fortunately, I was able to *have someone else* drain the excess oil out and after a few miles on the highway this morning, the leftover oil througout the entrails of my car burned away and by the time I got to work there was no more billowing smoke from my tailpipe.  So, what have I learned from this adventure (as I always learn something from everything).    1.  I'm just a girl.  No matter how much I believe I can do just about everything, I can't. 2.  I know just enough about cars to get myself into some really big trouble. 3.  The dipstick is there for a reason. 4.  I'm NEVER doing that again. From now on, I will pay for any and all work on my poor little car.    Diva out.           "

1319,Cancer,"       The person who always gets a good job is relentless and persistent in getting the job. The person who goes an extra mile by doing the unnecessary. It’s the person who goes above and beyond by doing something different or unique.   We have been playing by the same job search methods for years. But I found out a startling pattern with the people who bend these traditional methods.   The traditional methods are creating a resume, cover letter, or filling out a job application. Is there a law that states that you must not go beyond these methods? Of course not, I recommend that you do more by striving for what you want.   I guarantee that you will get noticed just from being unique. Now I’m not saying just do anything to get the employer or company attention. You want to think of create of ways that you can show that value that you will provide or the accomplishments and results that you have accomplished in your track record.   Let me give you a few examples that are rarely used:   ** Spice up your resume or cover letter by including a testimonial.   Have a current or past employer give you a testimonial based on your skills and accomplishments. I’m telling you that this will strike the interest of any one who reads your resume or cover letter.   ** Come in with a plan.   Nothing rocks a company’s or employer’s boat like a person who comes in with a plan that will increase the company or association’s revenue or productivity.   Take a moment and brainstorm some ideas that could improve the value of the company you are applying for. It will be well worth your time and effort.   ** Be included within the top 5% by the follow-up.   Yes, about 95% of job seekers usually don’t follow up. Remember that companies hardly ever hire a person in just a few days. It takes weeks to fill a position.   So guess who the employer will remember the most when the time comes to hire that one individual. It’s that person who has multiple exposures. Always remember that our human mind stores much easier from repetition…so don’t be afraid to follow up.   ** You can really crush the competition with a career portfolio.   Yes, it doesn’t matter what industry you’re part of, you can create a career portfolio even if you haven’t been working for long.   Your portfolio doesn’t have to be about how you perceive yourself. You can use the leverage of others to create the ultimate career portfolio so your career can continue to grow and prosper financially over years to come.

1320,Cancer,"           So instead of doing homework right now, which I should really be doing.... I'm gonna write in my good ol' blog while I'm pissed off and have thoughts in my head.   First off..... why they hell do I always like look for compliments but when I get them turn them down and not actually take them to heart? Like seriously I realized during hockey today that I don't really feel like I've accomplished anything at all in that sport because I don't feel like I get enough praise for the coaches or something, I feel like I always get the shaft... but when I am praised by other people I'm like ya right shutup you're only doing that to make me feel better. Then I just get really frusurated and obviously don't get any better. I just wanna tell ya'll that if you ever give me a compliment some how and I like totally reject it's only because I'm immensly screwed up in the head and vitorolic about like everything. I thank you for all the compliments if given but I just need to get whatever thing that's in me keeping anything from entering out.   I know I have to keep everything my own and not compare myself to anyone 'cause obviously we're all different people in every single way. But I do, when it comes to grades and being smart and playing hockey... I compare myself and I'm like dude I suck. That might also be a reason for me being so bitter to accepting compliaments. I just wanna live in a life where there is no stress about anything.  I wish I was 3 again... or in John Mayers song I was I was 6 again. Seriously if you think about it there was like no stress in our lives at all during that age, sure we may have had our temper tantrums but who cares we got over that in like a second and the only reason we acted in such a manner was because we most likely didn't get what we wanted, which clearly isn't related to what stress really is and doesn't fall under that topic. At that age you don't have to worry about school and college and what you want to do with your life. You don't have to worry about having a boyfriend or wanting a boyfriend, hell when you're 3 or 6 we're all basically little sluts messin around with all those little boys out there.... of your you guys you're the ones messin around with us and getting us to like you by calling as stupid (which actually still works to this very day at this very age, ha). But seriously if you can name one thing when you're that age that actually stresses you out I'd like to know, because life is a dream at the age, it's all to yourself and the future and sports and well life is not a problem. For one day I just wish I could focus on just that day, well no, on just that minute during that day, no thoughts about anything else, just what is happening, just like a 3 yr old. I want to go back to playing with my barbies I want to go back watching raffe... I want to go back to fairy tale land and not have to worry my life away. One simple day like that to get away from everything would possibly save me from a total breakdown some day.   I just want to accel in one thing, really be the best at one thing, I want to be really smart or really good at all sports, but really right now I'm just somewhat smart, and somewhat good at sports. I'm really not complaining about that, I'm fine with being where I'm at, it's just that it gets to me when everything I'm in there's someone better then me, I guess that also has to go along with me being so competitive.   I know I've probably got all my ideas from fairy tales and chick flicks 'cause I'm waiting for that perfect moment, perfect time, perfect guy, perfect kiss, and well perfect life. I have come to reality and have realized that is not going to happen, but if I were to have one wish, and to live it for a day, that would be it. But truely life is good, and I really can't complain, the only time I could is if I was dying or one of those kids in like Ethiopia that have malnutrition and dying of starvation. I just wish certain things would evaporate into the air and dissapear from my life forever. But while I'm hear wishing I should probably go to studying for ap us and doing all my hw, oh joy.

1322,Libra,"             Well well, yeah, I decided to try out this kind of a weblog, I used to be a user on  urlLink modblog.com , but I like this kind more, where I can have it on my own page and all that :)  Also, I count on having this one a bit more active, but let’s see!  I hope it will contain my general thoughts of the day, and a little journal on what's going on in my life in general  This,  also is the first post here, so it will just remain an info post about  what I've been doing for the last 3 months or something like that, it  will mainly just tell a little bit about me.  To start off, I'll  start around when my holidays started this year, which was the 19th  June, in the first weekend after this, me and my father left for a  little drive up through Sweden, to Finland and home again through  Norway, we left at Saturday, and was home again the Saturday after. The  special thing about our way of traveling is that my father has a  Land-Rover, where we can sleep in the back of the car, really nice  actually :) The trip was on around 4500 km's, so we drove much of the  time.  After this, I had a week of relaxing mostly, then I went together with some friends on a trip to France, to a  urlLink major gaming event   called ESWC, held in a place called Futurescope, I was there because I  am an administrator in the Danish organization HLTV.org, what we do is  broadcast games for public viewing, an example on the size is that  20.000 people watched the finals of the event. This was a rather nice  but expensive trip, costed me around 300$, which is a lot for an  everything but wealthy student like me :)   That much for the first post!         "

But ya New York is so awesome and it just makes it ten times better that I'm going there to play my favorite sport, lacrosse. I don't know there's just something about New York that draws my attention, it's so suddle, but so loud and out there. Everyone blends together even though the weirdest people on the planet are probably there, but still you can't seem to tell. It's my kind of place, it's somewhere you can be completely heard, yet at other times not heard at all, and I like that. New York is so intriging and just draws me in. I'll tell you more how I feel about New York once I visit Long Island.  Oh and I  love  Christopher Gilbert and ya I'm going to miss you oh so very much!!Oh and I  love  New York!!

1333,Pisces,"             Spent the bulk of the working on two things:  1. The new HF track SOLAR (now jokingly called SOLARIS in my computer). Took a long time to get into this track because I wasn't familiar with a lot of the tracks (mostly Summer Douche's 200 guitar tracks) and I needed to sit and listen to Ash's loops which are REALLY cool. I would say I spent a good 8 hours on this one. My initial version was over 8 minutes long, but as of this moment it's just under 6. I'm going to sleep on it and then decide if any more changes are needed. Then we'll commit it to mp3 and pass it out to the Factor Corp for further development. This song cries for the vocals of Peter Face.  2. Chemlab art and other business things pertaining to OXIDIZER, it's follow up, and a new F.J./Jared collaboration that I hope becomes the project I do after HF2. I have been quiet about Chemlab as of late, mostly because it's now just a matter of waiting for the record to come out. There is a lot of activity behind the scenes. I'll learn more perhaps when I'm in Chicago this weekend for Bradley J. Fox's wedding (S.O. and I are stopping at Crack Central to see the 'family' on Friday night)  I am obsessed with the MTV show NEWLYWEDS. That Jessica Simpson is a nightmare.

1335,Aquarius,"                 With all of the discussion regarding President Reagan over the past week, all the stories surrounding the Lightning's Stanley Cup win, the NBA Finals, and the increasing coverage of the upcoming Olympics, I've been thinking a lot about heroes and champions. I've been inspired as I've watched these athletes persevere under incredible physical and emotional pain to emerge as Champions. I've gathered a few of my thoughts from the stories of the Stanley Cup Champions to put together a profile of the heart of a champion.   Champions persist despite the odds  Many people believed that hockey didn't belong in Florida twelve years ago when the Lightning were founded. Florida?? The sunshine state?? No way. Hockey is for Canada, Detroit, and Pittsburgh. Tampa won't be a hockey town! The team first played in a barn at the Florida State Fairgrounds, and then later on a slushy rink at a baseball field. The franchise nearly went under with various ownership, management, and coaching changes, including one manager who made over 70 player changes in one year. Just four years ago, the Lightning were at the bottom of the division that was the bottom of all divisions. You couldn't get any lower.  Yet the powers of hockey continued to believe the Lightning could one day succeed. Bill Davis, the owner of the Pistons had enough faith and bought the team. A new manager full of fire and life was brought in, and a new coach began to breathe life back into these weary players.  The team recruited Dave Andreychuk and with the urging of his wife he landed in Tampa. Andreychuk was the veteran the team needed. Twenty-two years into his NHL career, he still had not kissed a Stanley Cup. Naysayers were constantly giving him grief, reminding him of his age and that he might not ever see that Cup. Still, he and the Bolts persisted. Dave brought a father figure to the team and the leadership they so desperately needed.  Five games into the finals, things still didn't look good. The Bolts were down 3-2, and only 5 teams in 60 years had ever come back to fin the final two games when down 3-2.  Champions never believe the odds or the statistics, and continue to pursue what they know in their heart they are called to do.   Champions lean into the pain  Personal pain? Forget it. Champions press on. During Game 2 of the finals, Dan Boyle's house burned down, leaving over $300,000 in damage. He continued to play every game, borrowing a teammates clothes.  Doctors commented how they could barely get the final stitch into the players' heads during game time injuries before they were on their feet ready to get back into the game.  The NHL employs the longest season of all the professional sports, and it is also one of the most physical games. The players were bruised, stitched, and beat up, yet they continued to play day after day over 100 games with rarely 2 days in between games.  Champions ignore the pain, lean into it, and continue to play. The prize is worth so much more than the pain.   Champions always believe  From day one of this season, they claimed that 'safe is death' and played all year for the championship. After losing game 5 at home, and now in that horrible position of being down 3-2 they told the arena administrative and janitorial staff on the way out the door 'we'll see you here Monday for game 7.' They continued to speak the next step, 'we'll have a victory breakfast tomorrow,' claiming each next step they needed to win.  Champions continue to believe and proclaim that belief through their speech.   Champions know who they are playing for.  The team manager commented on what a privilege it was to work with a group of athletes who were playing for the name on the front of the jersey, not the name on the back of the jersey.   Champions don't pursue individual egos and glory, they are unified in playing for the greater cause of their team and mission.   We are part of a worldwide, eternal championship team that has been  guaranteed  the victory! Let's not get down by the negativity we are surrounded by and remember that we can already proclaim the championship, no matter what the the odds may be in our lives. Lean into the pain remembering that it is just for a season; concentrate on the victory that lies ahead. Continue to believe, and proclaim those victory promises God has spoken. And most of all,  always  remember that you aren't playing for the glory of your own name on the back of the jersey.               "
1336,Sagittarius,"        Who says you can't buy happiness?  Or at least victory.  My oldest diva-ette is now 10.  As a 10 year old, she gets an allowance.  Not a set amount, and not a great amount, but its all hers.  Her only chores, currently, are to take the trash to the trash chute (10 steps from our door) and to attend to her hamster.  I pay her a dollar for each time to takes out the trash, which generally tallies up to $5 a week (once a day during the week).  Sometimes she will offer to do a load of laundry for me or take the dishes out of the dishwasher, which ups the tally by $1 each chore.  I do not offer compensation for cleaning her room or picking up her stuff from around the house; i.e. socks, shoes, clothes, books, markers, dishes, candy wrappers, etc. etc.   I just request that she do it, and do it now.  Whereby, she never fails to say, 'Ok, mommy'... and then never does any of it.  'Oh, I forgot' or 'I didn't hear you' are her pat excuses for when I go into my rant about what she didn't do.  So, now I have a strategy to improve her memory and hearing.  Now, when she forgets or doesn't hear me, it  costs her  a dollar.  At this rate, based on her current earnings, she could owe me big, fast!  This could be the best 'get rich quick' scheme ever designed.    Well, at least it will save me a few dollars in allowance.  And trust me, that dollar is so much more dear to her than it is to me.  When I announced my new plan to my little darling diva, you would think I'd told her I was cutting off a finger for each offense.  She was horror-stricken at the thought of owing ME a dollar!  I've found my mark and hit it directly.    Nevermind restricting her from TV or video games or grounding her.  Nope, money is the center of her universe; well, actually spending it is what brings her joy.  Mostly on candy or the occasional trinket or toy.    Childrearing isn't so much about strict discipline, yelling, ranting, and so on.  You just have to find their 'button'.  Children have an inherent knowledge of each parent's button - find theirs and the world is yours!  Diva out.         "

Plus Julian McMahon (Dr. Christian Troy) is so gorgeous!! I think this show is different from the other plastic surgery shows such as the one from MTV or the Swan, because they add more 'drama' in the story, which makes it more interesting. Can't wait to see more of it next week.  Today I had a training for my second job, and it started at 9am until 4pm. It was so tiring! We had to walk around campus and went to advocacy offices to get information and learn about their programs. We also had to do a lot of activities like scavenger hunt and a bunch of games.

If my readers will remember I have been in trouble with my boss for not doing a good job and coming in late and basically being a bad horrible person. Well imagine my surprise when I came to work today to find a 'Spirit Award' sitting on my desk. These are given out to employees that capture the spirit of the hospital workplace and go above and beyond what is expected of them. Do they know who they gave it to? The best part is that it can be handed out by any manager and I got one from my bosses boss. This doesn't change my work situation at all, but man was I surprised.          "

1348,Pisces,"             Well the guest stars SHINED last night, even though Ash forced us to record in the dark.   Ash, of course, comes armed to the hilt with gear and Robin shows up being Robin, so you know it's going to be a fun evening. My only demand as 'boss' is that we lay down Robin's fingerpicking piece that I have been in love with. Other than that, it's free reign for anyone to do whatever they want. Ash JUMPS for the bass guitar. I'm not kidding when I say JUMP.  So you put all these rockers in a room and what do you get? Soundtrack music!! moody, atmospheric soundtrack music.  We wrote two songs, both of which sound like music for film, something I have been aching to do for sometime, but never really pursued. Ash's current obession is the bass guitar and his attention to it SHOWS, as he lends a unique rythmn to the material, which leaves me free to indulge in my Peter Hook fantasies, but at a new and subdued level. Robin is a master of the acoustic. Her fingerpicking piece, now titled 'They've Just...', is excellent. Brandt and I stared at each other a few times, knowing that we had something, new, special, different and excellent to add to HF2. When Ash is telling me to record strings, you know we're on a roll. I forgot how fun it was to sit in a room with a bunch of friends and just create music. And it helps that the music is amazing!  Hopefully, this will be JUST the first round with these two...  Chemlab artwork is rolling in and is MASSIVE. Like an idiot I first hated the cover image, wrote Jared to say so, and then an hour later I was in love with it and feeling like an idiot. Anyway, it fits the album perfectly and the guy doing this, Mike, at Burnlab is solid. The contributor to this album and the fan in me both now want this album DONE so I can just hold it and play it for my friends. I'm dying to give a copy of the Chemlab to the kidd and yes, even Mark Mohtashemi.

1349,Sagittarius,"        busy busy day  gearing up for my road trip now.  i tried to resist paying bills, but some i just had to pay, so now i will have less money than i planned for.  but i know how to work a budget and stretch a dollar like the toughest yoga asana, so i know i'll be ok.  thinking happy thoughts and looking forward to hitting the road.  but today i'm in the office with oh so many projects to complete before i go.  so, just a quick post today and then i'll get down to business.  i just wanted to comment on how multi-cultural my girls are.  i have noticed that they have so many different friends from so many races and religions, and it makes me happy.  I never knew any muslim kids, or taiwanese/chinese kids, or catholic kids or even african-american kids.  i grew up in the new era of bussing and desegregation but there was very little socializing done among the different races.  the closest i ever got to diversity was my italian/american cousins and even they lived very far away.  its encouraging for me to see my children playing with other children just because they have fun together.  and sometimes i get to share a little knowledge and teach a little tolerance.  last night, my oldest diva overheard someone talking religion by the pool.  he was talking about jesus to some muslim kids, and my daughter said, 'Muslims don't believe in god.'  I briefly explained the small differences between the two religions.  that little optimist in me can't help but believe that if i can teach my children they may teach their children.  eventually, we will all understand that we are all one.  ok.  gotta get some work done.  diva out.

I think sets are a quite usefull addition to the containers, in facto so usefull that it's legit so I don't have to write 'from sets import Set as set' and can write down set literals. I use them a lot and have asked myself since why it hasn't been adopted earlier. Two thumbs up!   Generator Expressions  It is a little strange at first, but I think it's a natural and powerfull complement to list expressions. There's lambdas which enable lisp-like in place functions. There's list comprehensions which can be used in expressions. And now there's generator expressions, which can not only serve as a short form of generator-defintion, but also this expressions can be used in expressions, for example as arguments to a function, written in place. I like it, it will make for some nice and tidy code. That's pythonic, two thumbs up.   Decorators  I've very mixed feelings about this. On the one hand I rarely use function decoration as a pattern. On the other hand there's some rather large and liked frameworks, which do this kind of pattern extensively. I don't actualy know how many people work with this pattern realy, but I'd estimate that it's not the majority of users, perhaps not even near. So it's a feature only a small group of people will realy benefit. Alone for this fact, I think consideration should be very carefull if it's included or not. Then there's the story of the syntax. I can see that this a usefull pattern, once you start fiddling with it. I can also see that it's nice if a language supports a pattern. But imho @silly is no way to go. I have to type this sillyness everytime I want to decorate a function. For each decorated function it will be an additional @+funtion-name. And if I want multiple decorators nested, which is a nice idea, I will have to fill a line with multiple @. And this FOR EACH FUNCTION. Holy shit! If it must be that the language starts to support this kind of pattern ( of what I am not so terribly sure ), then please, with sugger on top, make it easy to read, nice to look at, and in a way that safes you a lot of typing. That would be like... the decorator block. Runs like this.     class someclass:    decorator require_int, staticmethod:        def foobar( a ):            pass        def another( a, b, c ):            pass    def a_normal( self ):        pass     That's a form that I would actualy like, and it give you the power to easely decorate a whole set of methods/functions.          "
1352,Gemini,"       I was having drinks with some friends the other night at this bar in North Beach. I was with other singles and it was kind of amusing watching everyone watch each other. Always looking for that certain someone to walk through the door. I don't know how you know who that person will be. I saw many attractive men walk by, but never really felt compelled to initiate conversation with any of them. (I guess they felt the same way about me too. Maybe it's because I wasn't wearing my see-through, ultra low-cut, half shirt, halter top, like all the other women there.) I find myself looking for that special someone but it often feels like that special someone isn't looking for me.  I've met many guys and even managed to date some of them, and the one common thing I realized is that we never want the same things. When my friend Kamal and his girlfriend broke up, primarily because they both wanted different things in life and from each other, it made me really think about what people want in relationships. I look at my married friends and see how they initially wanted different things- like one wanting to live near the ocean, the other wanting to live in Colorado. One wanting to start a family right away and the other wanting to wait much longer or maybe never wanting children. They've somehow managed to compromise or one of them sacrificed what they wanted in order to be together. Does this cause resentment? I'm not sure and I would like to think it doesn't.   Some of our wants are bigger than others and can't really be overlooked or sacrificed I guess. The whole 'I want children.' and 'I don't want children' is a big issue for example. We all have these ideas of what we want our lives to be like and things we want to do or ways of living, but there are people who gave up a little of those 'wants' for something worth more to them. Sometimes finding true love is worth enough to put aside some of the wants and other times love just isn't enough and the dreams are bigger. I hope to find someone who wants the same things as I do or at least think I'm worth finding the compromise of what we both want in order to have each other.   I saw this elderly couple walking down the street yesterday (very slowly, I might add) and they were holding hands. It was so cute. Their bodies, so old and frail, but the little signs of affection still very much alive. I want that.          "
1353,Virgo,"   I've alredy done the violin class, and it has gone so well that I feel very pleased. It was a very difficult class, and I had to practise my violin a lot. I don't feel stressed at all! Life's beautiful! "
1354,Taurus,"       Your touch, your eyes, with me all the time your smile, your lies, make me want to cry i miss you, i forget you i'm confused of what i feel i love you, i hate you these feelings are so real you're gone, i want you why did you have to leave you left, i'm here i wish we could have been your picture, those memories they feel so alive your lips, that kiss was that your mistake i liked, you apologized what went through your head your good, your bad things i wish to forget but i still miss you i still love you i still want you to be mine i want to hold you i want to see you i just want to cry your memory is strong your voice makes me calm those calls make me happy those calls make me miss your touch, your eyes, with me all the time your smile, your kiss, imprinted in my heart your friendship, the best the good times that we had your future, my future connected by these times always, forever together through it all friends, buds nothing to seperate that bond dont forger, neither will i those memories of us our fun times, our bad everything in our lives my feelings, you reading please dont laugh i miss, come back your friend you left behind             "
1355,Sagittarius,"       Well, the conference is finally over. Don't get me wrong - it was a great experience and I met some very interesting people... but when some of the students who were helping to organize/run the conference asked me yesterday if I wanted to go out with them last night, the answer was a very fast 'YES'.  It was so nice to get out and see a little bit of the city, and not have to think about work.  We went to a part of the city called Pontao. I can only describe this as 'tropical, but without the sand'. It was on one side of a man-made lake, and it was beautiful. I didn't get to take too many pictures because I was trying not to be too touristy, but I think I would like to return there today (in the daylight!).   Plus, the currency conversion is very favourable here... one 'real' (their currency) is about .44 of a Canadian Dollar... I think I will go shopping!  time for breakfast!         "

1358,Pisces,"             This comes all the way from our new friend Timo, who lives in Berlin, who I mentioned a few posts back about having trouble getting our CD's. Well, looks like he bought himself the entire catalogue! Here's what he had to say (slightly edited)  'hello F.J.  the hypefactor record totally makes my day at the moment. i don't know what to say.....it is such an amazing piece of soulful and of honest music - yeah, this might just sound pathetic but damn, it is without the shadow of a doubt an incredible effort and i wanted to let you know. listening to the ep i really start to think it was absolutely about time that you did something on your own. this is your counterfeit ep. well kinda, but a thousand times better. distracted lover so totally takes me away, this doesn't happen too  often anymore. i am sure i love it as i love the last crack record and man, i truly dig that one.....  i love the hommage to some of the 80s heroes like smiths and new order and just how you turn these so wonderfully around and take out the best from those and give it a 2k3 facelift and throw in all of your honest feelings and thoughts and damn......awesome. i might just not find the right words, F.J., i am sorry. but hey, one thing's for sure. YOU DID IT.  as for the  the aggression material, i almost love flood album as i do love the distracted lover ep, hell it is so mad. there's so many new elements to be discovered that just aren't to be found on the forst two records and i absolutely salute that. it is x times more playful, more versatile, more achterbahn, more  progressive, more of an original sound as on the old ones. i hardly know a band that's joyfully making music industrial-style like YOU, yeah, you hear that all the way thru the album from the first second on, there's musicians at work who do it from the core and from their very hearts. flood has turned out a killer album and you guys deserve a whole fucking lot more recognition (well that's clear anyway, you sure don't need me to tell;-) for your music and your art.  i really like the two old albums as well. i have to say my faves on the debut aggro are the very last track ('permanent' - for its come armageddon, come, come, nuclear bomb - atmo) and the (quasi-hidden) chicago drinking song, that's a fantastic moment. the salvo remix on the remix album is killer as is the cydonia remixis really awesome!  damn, i almost forgot the precious little gem being the deviations single. highly inspired and decently worked out fuck-with-yous, like that one a lot, too. as i mentioned before, i somehow dig the very last remix totally. what  a twisted fucker. cuckooland supreme.  come on, F.J., i want an honest answer, you have been playing with the thought at making a full-length hypefactor album, haven't you?! can't wait for that to happen....'  He's going to be a happy Timo in 2004, I think ;-)  F  PS: 'cuckooland supreme' is the best description of Ash I have EVER heard!            "

1361,Aquarius,"       I think that these ghost stories are fact, they are true. I can't prove it, but I know. I don't know why I think that it's a fact. My mom saw a ghost once, this happened about 10 years ago. My aunt saw a ghost, well, I'm not sure if it was an actual ghost, but she said it was a monster. the monster was sitting on the bed next to her daughter. She said she was yelling at the 'monster' to leave her daughter alone, the next night, the 'monster' was gone.         "
1362,Sagittarius,"            Today SUCKED.      I had to work, and it has never been that boring, EVER!!  Then after, I went to visit Aaron, but he was done, so we waited for heather and jon to come out of a movie, and went to pizza hut with them.  It was fun...But I was sad the whole time, because I still miss heather.  Ah well.      The I took a movie back, and followed an STi for a long time.  It was so cool.  It sped up, with no problem at all, and the muffler was about 3 or 4 inches from the ground. OOOOOOOOOOOO      Okay, I'm gonna go now, because I have to work tomorrow, and it'll suck a lot.

1375,Sagittarius,"        My day was better  Just when you think things are rough, you find out someone else has it rougher.  I spoke with DBD this morning to find out when I can expect my first child support payment from his new job.  He informed me that he wasn't sure, but that I would be receiving something very soon, since he was arrested over the weekend.  What!  Yup.  DBD went to jail over the weekend.  He was stopped while driving and as there was a warrant out for his arrest, he was taken into custody.  He had to borrow $1000 - exactly what he's owed the judge for purge for almost a year - to get himself out of jail.  I feel bad that it went that far.  I never really wanted him to be arrested.  But, he could have borrowed the damn money when he got the notice of contempt a few months ago.  Avoiding his responsibilities finally caught up with him.    The amazing thing is that no one in his family told me about this.  I was there all day Saturday and not one person said anything.    So, at least I should be able to get my car out of the shop soon.  What he had to pay to get out will come directly to me - and it should do so very soon.  Diva out.           "

Very grateful to have the father that I do.    I don't show it enough.  Someday I would love to take him on a trip with me.  France perhaps and walk the beaches of Normandy.  Or London.

1383,Sagittarius,"        The Dragons are coming!   For some reason, there is an increase in Asian culture in Miami.  And I couldn't be happier.  I'm volunteering this weekend with the  urlLink First Annual Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival  this weekend.  I'll be behind the performance stage, doing whatever they need me to do.  Hope I can actually see the boats from where I'm stationed.  I'm looking forward to the exciting races, with the deep beating of drums urging paddlers to row faster.  I'm also looking to the food and merchandise.  I'm hoping to find a relatively inexpensive Kwan Yin statue for my altar at home.  And its really hard to find good Chinese food, so maybe this will be a very  tasty  event.  And, I must confess, I am looking forward to all of the Asian men.  My Asian boyfriend in NY sounded just a little jealous when he pointed out this very obvious benefit to this particular event.  I do like Asian men *blushing slightly*.  So, this is pretty much a win-win for me.  I get to do good by helping others, bring cultural awareness to the city, eat good food, shop, see great cultural performances, and enjoy the eye candy as well.

1386,Libra,"       A sentence from  Atonement  that strikes a chord:    There was desperation in all she said, an emptiness at its core, or something excluded or unnamed that made her talk faster, and exaggerate with less conviction.    It strikes a chord, of course, because it reminds me of myself. When something in art - literature, music, movies, photography, whatever - reminds me of myself, then and only then do I love it. Any interest I have in art proceeds from my search for myself - my love-hate, attraction-repulsion infatuation with my own reflection. (Hence this one-way mirror of a blog.) Actually, it's not so much art I'm referring to but anything esthetic, such as a finely built house or a well-designed kitchen appliance. Not that a house or a kitchen appliance isn't art. In esthetics, I look for myself first and foremost. And only in esthetics do I condone such narcissism on my part. Everywhere else, that narcissism is something I regret and hate.  My love affair with Ivory soap has ended amicably. We're friends. We still hook up. I've started seeing Dove.  I am considering 'Jinjer' as a porn star name for myself. That's 'Jinjer' with two j's. As for a surname, that's still up in the air - let me get back to you.  Potential digital art concept: 'Helena Handbasket.' Or 'To Helena Handbasket.' I don't know what that means, yet. But it's a potential digital art concept in a vein similar to 'Ground Apple.' By 'Ground Apple,' I'm not referring to this blog - I'm referring to the term 'ground apple' and what it could connote and inspire. Some other time, I'll explain why the term 'ground apple' preoccupies me.  Hmmm, 'Jinjer Handbasket'... Maybe. Come to think of it, 'Helena Handbasket' is worth consideration as a porn star name too.         "

1388,Aquarius,"                  All the Things I Hate   Today I got to do all the things I hate! At least I got them all out of the way on a Monday so I can enjoy the rest of the week! I've got this weird paranoia about Dr. offices, hospitals, needles and x-rays, and today I got to go to the Doctor AND get my blood drawn (all just routine stuff). I have no idea how, when or why my paranoia began, but I remember almost passing out during x-rays in the 6th grade. Then in high school I DID pass out after some shots. I remember telling the nurse I felt queasy and next thing I knew I was staring at Barney on the ceiling. If you ever want to get  me worse than running your fingers on a chalkboard, just tell me about your recent ailment. Be warned though, I might throw up! Whenever I go to a hospital or nursing home to visit someone as I approach the parking lot, my chest starts to tighten. I have to take slow, deep breaths to slow my heart down and control that nauseous knot in my stomach. So this afternoon I went through the whole routine as I pulled into the parking lot and sat in the waiting room. THEN she said she was going to draw some blood. I've learned to just flat out tell them I'm a sissy and that I should lay down. They're always quite happy to oblige since they don't want to have to pick me up off the floor!

1389,Aquarius,"           I've just thought of an ingenious invention. Well, not really, but it would be cool to do. Ready? It's an automagical dog house thingy. It has features such as automagic dog food / water dispenser that allows you to program feeding schedules, climate control, solar cells with energy storage device to save on energy, self cleansing, automagic back-scratcher, shock button (for disciplining), and self destruct button (in case the dog goes Kujo). Throw in a camera or two for monitoring as well as a microphone/speaker so you can communicate with the dog ('go and get me the paper boy') and you've got it made.          Snowflake out ...     "
1390,Gemini,"           For the past year or two, it has been a rarity to find me actually  urlLink glued  to the TV for more than an hour. Increasingly I find there just isn't that much on TV that can keep me watching from show-to-show. I might tune in for the occasional show, but then I'll head off to get online, or read, or continue writing up my plans to stalk/romance  urlLink Samantha Mathis .  Tuesday nights are beginning to change this. Last night I tuned in for  urlLink The Gilmore Girls . I swear the writing on this show is getting better with each season. To the casual observer, it looks like nothing more than a girly  urlLink 7th Heaven  style family program, which it very easily could be. The difference is that the writing on the show is hysterically funny. There's rarely any real plot to speak of in any given episode.   The classic scene from last nights episode involved the Rory and Lorelai Gilmore visiting a Harvard Allumni to get tips on applying to enter Harvard. I almost fell off my couch laughing when after meeting his family, Lorelai repeatedly insinuates that there is an incestuous relationship taking place in the household. Not funny to read in a blog. Hilarious when spoken by the ever so spunky  urlLink Lauren Graham .  Usually this one hour of TV would be the end of my TV watching. Not so. Tuesday nights also herald the greatness that is  urlLink The West Wing . Honestly, the show kind of sucked last year for the first 3/4. But this year I'm falling in love with it again. The writing has steered away from the heavy political nature of season 3 and is returning to what the show did best. Focusing on the humanity of these professionals. I just wish I could understand how the hell the US electoral process works. I've been trying to work it out for years, but all this business with Primaries has me completely bewildered.  I actually sat through an episode of Star trek: Deep Space Nine. Never done that before.         "
1391,Sagittarius,"        Feeling Much Better    the holidays have passed, and life is back to normal.  Kids are in school and everyone is back in the office. *BIG sigh of relief*  and, as i have had to wait 5 months for that bail bond payment from waaaaay back in August, and am still waiting, i have come to realize something.  i have allotted that money to everything from rent, to long overdue bills, to paying back debts to friends that lent me money, to buying christmas presents.  oh, and repairing my car.  in the meantime, some of those bills have somehow been paid without receiving that money.  christmas gifts were bought.  well, the car still needs repairing.  but i'm still waiting.  now the circus is coming and i want to take my girls, and the car still needs repairing.  there are so many new ways to spend that money, and yet, somehow, even without the money i've managed to keep moving.    i can't help but see the lesson in all of this.  although i would have preferred to have had a check instead of a lesson, my own nature finds yet another way to be grateful for what i haven't got (yet).

1392,Aries,           this is too funny... must share www.muffinfilms.com         
1393,Taurus,"       From Friday's Boston Globe:     'Boston is too racist for me,'' he said. 'I couldn't play there.'    'Only what guys have said,' he said, 'but that's been going on ever since my dad [Bobby] was playing baseball. I can't play like that. That's not for me, brother.'  When it was suggested the racial climate has changed in Boston, Bonds demurred.  'It ain't changing,' he said. 'It ain't changing nowhere.'  They built a tunnel to honor Ted Williams in Boston. What did he imagine would be built for him?  'Nothing, man,' he said. 'I'm black. They don't build stuff for blacks.'  ------------------------------------------------------------  O.K., why does Barry Bonds have to go out of his way to diss my city, huh?  I'm sure if he was confronted on his improper grammer for the use of the wrod, 'ain't', he'd probably blame that on 'The Man' too.  Does Boston have racist undertones?  Yes.  Even the Red Sox do (The original owner, Tom Yawkey, was from Tennessee and a former plantation owner).  If you ever get a chance, read Boston Herald's columnist Howard Bryant's book, 'Shut Out'.  Great stuff about how the Sox were the last team in the MLB to have a black player (Yankees were 2nd to last.  You see?  We CAN beat them at something!).  That was also the famed tryout of where Jackie Robinson, Willie Mays, and Josh Gibson were on the Fenway grass and someone yelled out, 'Get those niggers off the field!'   The city itself has had a shaky history, I'll admit it.  We had the segregation of busing in South Boston during the 70's, the Charles Stewart dibacle, Bill Russell's house getting ransacked in the 'burbs, former Celtic Dee Brown being confused for a bank robber in a Wellesley bank when he was a rookie, and of course Malcolm X calling Boston, 'The most racist city in America'.    It's still somewhat uncomfortable to minorities.  Ever listen to WJAMN (Jam'n) 94.5?  Yeah, it's a 'Hip Hop' radio station not owned or run by black people.  Listen to it someday.  It shows because it sucks.  But the people in Boston arn't THAT bad!  This isn't fucking KKKtown, Arkansas.  For every one racist moment we have had, Anytown, MS has had probably around 20 to match it.  It's not like we're burning crosses on lawns or having different proms for white and black students.  Even black Boston athletes are being recieved more here than they ever have. And they feel more comfortable because of it. Look at Pokey Reese; corn rows n' all, he's by far the most popular player out of all of the new additions this year (AND that's including Schilling and Foulke).  Plus, if Barry had known Boston's history, he would have known that when the first federal census was enumerated in 1790, Massachusetts was the only state in the Union to record NO slaves.  He also said that Boston doesn't build stuff for blacks, where in fact, the African American Meeting house was built by the city in 1805 so blacks could have a church to call home (because they faced minor discrimination in white churches, and that was just by forcing them to the bleacher seats - but hey, at least the city acknowledged they're bigots!)  In addition to its religious and educational activities, the meeting house became a place for celebrations and political and anti-slavery meetings, including a famous speech by Socalist Frederick Douglas.  See, Barry?  We arn't so bad when it comes to racism!  Maybe if you came here and saw for yourself how warm of a city Boston is to minorites (And unlike in New York City, you'll even get a cab from the airport!), you would think twice about what you said.  Plus, we would EVEN build something for your arrival to prove we're not racist AND to make you feel comfortable.....  We'd build a needle.......a BIG GIANT needle.  You'll feel right at home.  Prick.         "

1395,Sagittarius,"        Is this progress?  Sometimes its hard to tell whether I'm moving forward or backward.  So, let us review, shall we?  Littlest diva has recovered from her week-long fever.  Only last night did I find the source of the fever - she's cutting a new tooth near the back of her jaw.  Molar I guess.  So, now I know what caused the fever, and I know I can look forward to another week long fever episode soon - when the tooth on the other side starts.  My office space is almost done.  Its sort of miraculous how these men have managed to tear down walls and what-not and put up new walls and such.  Its like the bathroom never existed at all.  I should have my *new* desk and chair by next week and will move in then.  My ankle still hurts and is still slightly swollen.  Not 8-months-pregnant-swollen, but swollen nonetheless.  And I discovered a lovely bruise of deep deep purple just below my right ankle, which explains why this sprain hurt more than any other I can recall.  I thought I broke it, but no.  Just a sprain.  I'm getting caught up at work, and I've managed to sell 4 tickets to the  urlLink Cystic Fibrosis Miami Wine Opener  - only 96 more to go!  Let me know if you're interested in tickets - I've got plenty.  So, perhaps there is some progress, now that I step back and look at it all.  Not bad, Diva, not bad.  Diva out.           "

Time to go repeat the Bible again.' I am godless (almost)! I am Unitarian! And then our teacher wants to stuff Jesus down our throats? Hahahahahaha fuck no.  Okay that's all I really wanted to say but I think I'll ramble for the fun of it.  I am a fellow of two very pleasant young ladies now that I do not think I had met before. One, Miss Whitney Adsit, also attends AP Biology (but not Lab) with me. The other is miss Amber Birch, who joins me in Economics and AP English. I think they are lovely and amiable.

1398,Gemini,"             ...Of really actually doing this. Let's see if this works. It may be a complete disaster. I am a big pussy about trying new things. I would like to be able to think of myself as 'spontaneous' and 'unpredictable', but sadly that's not really the case. I am such an stubborn old lady sometimes, which is bizarre, as I feel like a complete child in relation to the world. Why am I doing this? Well, I am at work at the Seattle Art Museum right now. It is very slow. I get to play online when it's slow. Which is a lot. So this is something new to distract myself with. Because that way I won't check my email 500 times every half an hour.   Maybe. I am actually surprised how easy this is. Perhaps this is just because I am a more accomplished typist. And I am enjoying this... ...Because isn't this every writer's dream? To see their writing in print in public? But I don't want to focus on that aspect. I am doing this because it really is just the act of writing that I am interested in.

1399,Sagittarius,"        Random bits & pieces  First off, I think I may have figured out a way to fit yoga AND meditation into my daily schedule.  I've been working in one or the other for the past few weeks, and my yoga is really suffering.  Last night, I managed to do both before bedtime, and it felt great.  So, I'm putting both on my daily agenda; now if only my little diva-ettes will cooperate by going to bed on time...  I took my now 11 year old diva-ette, along with 5 other 10-11 year old girls, to see Hidalgo on Saturday night.  No, it wasn't penance for my sins, it was a birthday party for my daughter.  It was a lot of fun actually, and I really enjoyed the movie on many levels.  There were some subliminal messages that I got from it, like comparing the 'Arabians' to the American Indians, and the lack of knowledge about the culture creating hatred for that culture.  And, finding yourself, being true to yourself... so many levels to appreciate.  The girls liked the horses. :p  And, they've installed monitoring software on the internet here at work, so that may mean fewer installations.  I know... I know... you're wondering how will you ever live  without your diva.  But, have no fear, dear reader.  I'm working on getting internet at home (which will probably end up being monopolized by the above-mentioned 11 year old).  So, when I should be doing my down-dogs, I may end up blogging instead.  And, one last note; I saw two things downtown on Saturday morning that I've never seen before.  Not counting the new farmer's market, I saw several 'Help Wanted' signs in shop windows, and I saw an overhead construction walkway, encompassing one whole street corner.  To me, these are indicators of growth in the area.  Downtown hasn't seen growth in many many years.  It was just a place to get the occasional bargain, but never considered a serious business/shopping/entertainment area.  With new businesses, growth in current businesses, new construction of housing; Downtown is fast becoming a really great place to live.  Diva out.         "

1404,Sagittarius,"        2 tragedies in 2 days in Florida  After seeing the news this morning, I realize that I need to sit my girls down and have a serious talk tonight.  Everyone probably knows by now about the missing 11 year old girl in Sarasota.  Luckily, they have the abduction on tape somehow, so they know who did it.   Sadly, the abductor isn't being very cooperative, so the girl is still missing.   Something you may not have heard about is the murder of a 14 year old boy by classmate in a South Florida school.  One 14 year old boy cut the throat of another 14 year old boy in the school bathroom early Tuesday morning.  While the boy has admitted to the crime, the motive has not yet been established.  These are the things parents dread and fear.  Horrific stories of brutality that you wouldn't bare to hear happening to an adult, much less a child.  And we all think we are impervious to such assaults.   That could never happen to my child.  My child is too smart for that to happen to him/her.   * Tell your child to never go near or into a stranger's car.   * Tell your child to scream, yell, blow a whistle, make as much noise as possible.  Even if the stranger threatens to hurt them if they make noise - be as loud as they can. * Even if the stranger has a gun, run away.  Either the person won't bother to shoot, or if they do shoot, and by some luck actually hit you, you're still better off bleeding in public where someone can help you. * Grab onto something bigger than you and don't let go for anything.  If you're holding onto your bike, a big stick, a telephone pole, whatever, you won't fit into the person's car. *Don't try to help an adult who is a stranger.  You can find an adult you know to help the stranger, but don't do it by yourself. * 911 is a free call.  As soon as you get away, dial it.  The cops will find you no matter where you are as long as you stay by that payphone.  And for school, these rules may have to apply to other students unfortunately.  Its hard to know if your child is being bullied at school.  But, you have to talk about it.  It's the only way to really know what's going on there.  They spend anywhere from 5 to 8 hours there every weekday, and you really need to know what's happening to your child.  These are the things I'm going to tell my very smart daughters tonight.   And then I'm going to hug them very very tightly.  Diva out.         "

1406,Taurus,"           Had to take this one down, but I liked it, so I'm saving it ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Duc, in case you didn't know D is what we call a member of the 'angry left' - pissed of the president is principaled, pissed off we're in iraq, pissed off at halliburton, pissed off that the economy is turning around. An altruistic, nihilistic, pot smoking, tree hugging hippy. Imagine 'Office Space'....  *shrugs*   I dont know what he's trying to prove. If anything. I think he thinks he's smarter than the rest of the board - so he posts cryptic messages that only other pot smoking hippies can understand. In board terms he's relegated to 'shit-stirrer' status, b/c, for all intents and purposes, he has nothing else to say, but he's angry damnit.    For reference, other members of the 'angry left' have things like this to say:  Quote: I Hope the Bloodshed Continues in Iraq Well, that should bring the bats out of the attic with fangs dripping. I won't be hypocritcal. It is politically correct, particularly in any Dem discussion to hope and pray and feel for our troops and scream 'bring them back now'. I'm fighting something bigger. I'm a 58 year old broad and I can tell you that what is going on in our country isn't the usual ebb and flow of politics where one party is in power and then another; where the economy goes through ups and downs.......yawn, yawn--just wait a bit and things will turn out peachy keen. That stupid la-la land is over. I realize that not every GI Joe was 100peeercent behind Prseeedent Booosh going into this war; but I do know that that is what an overwhelming number of them and their famlies screamed in the face of protesters who were trying to protect these kids. Well, there is more than one way to be 'dead' for your country. They are not only not accompishing squat in Iraq, they are doing crap nothing for the safety, defense of the US of A over there directly. But 'indirectly' they are doing a lot. The only way to get rid of this slime bag WASP-Mafia, oil barron ridden cartel of a government, this assault on Americans and anything one could laughingly call 'a democracy', relies heavily on what a shit hole Iraq turns into.  They need to die so that we can be free. Soldiers usually did that directly--i.e., fight those invading and harming a country. This time they need to die in defense of a lie from a lying adminstration to show these ignorant, dumb Americans that Bush is incompetent. They need to die so that Americans get rid of this deadly scum. It is obscene, Barbie Bush, how other sons (of much nobler blood) have to die to save us from your Rosemary's Baby spawn and his ungodly cohorts.   AND, they get really REALLY pissed off when they read sites like:   urlLink Healing Iraq   Written by an Iraqi in support of the US 'occupation'.  And what fires them up most of all is pictures like  urlLink this .  Oh, and one last link from the urlLink  LA Times  - from a reformed lefty who had this to say:   Quote: We put them in those rowboats — we antiwar demonstrators, we sophisticated, smart guys. The war was nearly over when I graduated from high school. But high school students were old enough to demonstrate. They were old enough to feel superior to the fools who were running the government. And they were old enough to have known better. They were old enough to have understood what communist regimes had cost the world in suffering, from the prisons of Havana to the death camps of Siberia. Today we are haunted, in thinking about Iraq, by the fact that a noisy, self-important, narcissistic minority talked the United States into betraying its allies. (Loyalty didn't mean a lot to antiwar demonstrators; honor didn't mean a lot.) We betrayed our allies and hurried home, to introspect. They stayed on, to suffer. We were eager to make love, not war, but the South Vietnamese weren't offered that option. Their alternatives were to knuckle under or die. It was my fault, mine personally; I was part of the antiwar crowd and I'm sorry. But my apology is too late for the South Vietnamese dead. All I can do is join the chorus in shouting, 'No more Vietnams!' No more shrugging off tyranny; no more deserting our friends; no more going back on our duties as the strongest nation on Earth.   *************************************** I'll be the one to protect you from  Your enemies and all your demons  I'll be the one to protect you from  A will to survive and a voice of reason  I'll be the one to protect you from  Your enemies and your choices son  One and the same I must isolate you  Isolate and save you from yourself. ***************************************         "

1408,Capricorn,"             Yeah, the third day of Forensics at La Salle.  Today, I am having more people interaction.  I guess everyone is loosening up.  And that could or could not be a good thing.  I'm not in such a remembering mood now.  But there was this retelling of a conversation after lunch.  Some people are just so sheltered.  Its not even that.  Maybe sheltered isn't the right adjective.  Some people are just ignorant of certain facts about sex.  Sure, why would they care about them?  I guess I'm just looking it at a curious person's point of view, but a person should know what goes on in the body of the opposite gender.  I won't begin to tell you how sad it would be if they don't even know what is going on in their own body.  So people were explaining to this girl about circumsizion.  However you spell that.  Anyway, they retell that conversation in front of me thinking that I will turn red or something.  Instead, I turn slightly insulting in that I call the other girl sheltered.  And turn around to really focus on the work.  Since we were dealing with somewhat lethal chemicals, neurotoxins and whatnot.  Somehow, a lot of people there think I'm a genius.  Or really smart.  Or they're just joking.  Which is confusing but anyway.  So we're doing the experiment and every so often, I wow they with random science facts.  I guess they like that.  Like the agarose gel.  The enzyme for that is procured from seaweed.  I think.  Tch.  I thought these people were smart.    I told them my story about how I went to Condom Kingdom with my friends.  Great adventures.  Suddenly the sheltered girl just says 'Can we talk about something else?' which was kind of dumb since I wasn't really talking to her to begin with.  So I go on a whole rant about how it'll do her good to hear about these things.  And how she should go down to the ghetto to learn a few things.    Its funny, cliques.  They form.  Which is a by product of the small group.  I can't complain too much, the cliques sometimes interchange members.  Everyone knows each other now.  Insulting each other in a friendly way.  *shrug*  So I was measuring the lines from the standard protein samples from the electrophorisis test when someone behind me puts their hand on my shoulder.  Actually, she has been doing that somewhat during the whole day.  And its really bothering me.  I hate it when people touch me for no apparent reason.  Like a 'oh, how are you?' sort of thing.

1409,Aquarius,"             This  urlLink Korea Times Business Section editorial  speaks of Jwa Seung-hee's (president of an economic research institute for the Federation of Korean Industries) 10 mysteries of the Korean economy.  #1 Western-style economic reform has eroded the dynamism of the Korean economy.  #2 Seoul has become bigger and bigger despite the government's policy of balanced regional development.  #3 The rural community's life has become dismal despite the policy of promoting the balanced development of the rural and urban communities.  #4 Income disparity has widened despite the policy of promoting egalitarianism and redistributive policies.  #5 Competitiveness of small companies has weakened despite the policy of curbing chaebol.  #6 Economic concentration has deepened despite the policy to diffuse the concentration of economic power.  #7 The exodus of primary, middle and high school students for overseas study has increased as the government seeks to standardize schools.  #8 Government control of finance has deepened amid sloganeering for financial liberalization.  #9 The Roh administration seeks to scrap the Park Chung-hee’s economic development model, which created the Miracle on the Han River. #10 The government has strengthened policies, which would erode corporate competitiveness.  To this business/economic list I'd like to add a cultural 10 mysteries of modern Korean culture, if I may.  #1 Koreans often speak of love for their children and the sanctity of marriage but many men (and women) have lovers on the side. #2 Many Korean parents (or grandparents) insist that children marry Koreans, even though they send their kids overseas to study, or to hagwons (language academies) here. (N.I.M.F.T Not In My Family Tree) #3 Everyone seems to like the promise that is living in a different country, but very few can make the move out of Korea. #4 Koreans (especially the young) love the outdoors and clean air, but they hate to live in the country. #5 Korean students hate learning English, but older ones seem to love taking English classes. #6 Even after years of incredible progress Koreans always compare themselves to foreigners: the Rodeo Drive of Seoul, the Silicon Valley of Korea, the Harvard of Korea. #7 Most Koreans seems to have a negative attitude toward U.S. soldiers here (especially those who served in KATUSA-Korean Army Training with U.S. Army) but they don't seem to want them to leave (and leave South Korea vulnerable). #8 Koreans spend 10-16 hours a day (for years on end) studying for major exams but at the end of it all don't seem to have a stored library of knowledge to use in everyday life (or even at work!). #9 Koreans are very (over) protective of their children, and yet they have few child restraint seats and no one uses seatbelts in the back seats. #10 Many Koreans have dogs as pets, but many other Koreans eat dog!  Another interesting story came to me from a friend of mine. A group of 20 or so young people were on the subway when it came to a station with about 20 older folks waiting to get on.  The kids were sitting down in the seats, but without a word or any signals they ALL stood up together and offered their seats to the older folks.  Unreal.  The more things change, the more things stay the same.         "

It's been really hard to find a vet for Buddy. The one I had in mind is in the hospital 'How ironic' my brother says. The only other one I can tell is about an hours drive away, so I'd rather have somewhere closer. If anyone knows of a good resource for turtle information please let me know. I have been on the web and bought a book, but I want to get my little guy checked out. Maybe I'll upload one of my crappy pictures of him just so you can see.    "

1415,Leo,"       Bonjour les petites madames,  This time, I am all inviting you to the Collection, Tuesday, June 15, 7:30pm.  For the last few weeks, we have had a lot of fun discussing women issues, relationships, the impact of media, women role models, etc. But this time, I would like to propose something a little different.  First:  Each one of you should bring a baby or kid picture of yourself. Then, you need to present us a passion that you have, a book that you read, or an activity that you do and that the other girls don't really know about.  I think it would be a great way to solidify our bonds =)  By the way, the Collection manager told us he would do any Martini we want, who knows, we might even be able to negotiate a discount hihi!  Hope to see you all Tuesday and tonight (Friday) at our little potluck party.          "
1416,Libra,       Ooh.. I wanna see Sleepover!! I'll go w/ you Erica!! Or we could see A Cinderella Story.. even tho i've already seen it.. but i HIGHLY recomment it.. its SO adorable!! I thought it was gonna be cheesy too.. but it was REALLY good.. oh yea.. and Chad Michael Murray is so dang HOTT!! And Erica.. i agree.. even tho i haven't seen Sleepover.. that guy looks FiNE!! :-D haha.. but i need to go to bed now..             
1417,Scorpio,"   What is wrong with me?  Now I seriously think I've lost it!  Why do I let him screw with me? My tactic for today was supposed to be evasive!  E-V-A-S-I-V-E!!     Screw it!  At the request, or rather insistence of our mutual piece of work, I called him. MR, was worried about some work that he had done for him; I had to call him!  I had no choice! Narcissistic, the guy is Narcissistic! So I try to be friendly; mind you, did he not just have dinner with me a week ago?  Did I just not talk to him LAST MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDS, and did he not just call me on Thursday?  And he can't remember my voice???  Ok, I was calling from the cell, and yes I have a freaking cold, but still... He didn't know who I was???? A complete blank???  He told me that our mutual cannot rely on me for help, and that it was nothing that I did wrong... I didn't think I had done anything wrong! I should have said, K--'You know, if you don't try to belittle me or insult me it will be a first!  In fact, every time I talk with you, you have something really crappy and demeaning to say!' Oh, But what the hell is his problem?   I shall not ascend to his greatness no doubt--the enlighend one indeed!  Ah, he really troubles me; he works me all up for nothing! I feel like crying over this complete ASSHOLE!  He's not even worth my tears!  Ok, back the phone coversation; So the mutual is stressing out in the back ground while I'm talking on the phone.  So I say, 'I'll call you tomorrow... What time is good for you?'  He gives tons of explanations, and lets not forget how my phone call would interfere with his damn swimming... 'I have to go swimming...' Does he want me to be proud of him because he goes swimming?  Like his stupid, long and lanky body could use the muscle building!    Nevertheless, I said, '7:30.' He said, 'I have my daughter..' What difference does that make?  We're not going to have phone sex!  I said 'I don't want to leave a message...' He said, '7:30 that should work...'  Did he not suggest to me on weds of last week that I might call him for next week for this very reason?  And now it is a little game?  Jumbled Chaos indeed!  He's putting me on the rack!  I don't feel my age.  I feel like a sixth grader. And the worst part about it is that I know he doesn't care if I call him or not.  This man delights not in me! All of this TRAUMA he is putting me through, and it doesn't touch him one way or another...  How does one live his life like that?  Just absoultely numb to the vivacity around him? I don't get how he could be absoultely numb to this passionate, youthful, feminine, sexy, creation fluttering around him! Don't get me wrong, I'm not flaunting myself; I haven't sat on his lap.  I haven't been agressive.  But I have been simply me, and that energy I carry with me is undeniable.  I know my own strengths!   Usually, I am so noticed... Not that I look for it, but it is just always there.  He's working me up to no end.  I don't want to talk to him anymore!  But in this instance I had to for the sake of the mutual.  It was a mutual intervention if you will... I have to talk to him tomorrow, and I'm going to be BOTHERED all day about it!  But K--he's probably not even worrying either way...  I feel like telling him: 'You know, I don't expect you to remember my voice... It doesn't sound like yours!'  No narcissus, it doesn't sound like yours!  He's conceited.   I'm not competing with him. I hate competition!  I'm not a game player. He's got a chip on his shoulder.  And maybe that's where I feel sorry for him.  'Pathos' he said at dinner.  I don't want people to feel 'Pathos for me'... Well, I DO feel sorry for him!   I can't help it!  He's stuck on himself.  He's got a cold and rotten temperament.  He's selfish, and dark!  He doesn't know what he wants; he's on a search. And when your searching for what you dont know, you end up with what you don't want...   'Oh, I am Fortune's Fool!'  You know when EB, beautiful EB, exited my life, I told him, 'I am never going to be this close to your lot Again.'  I meant it! I passed my education, away from the like.  And with K, it is the same thing.  I am never, ever, going to be in contact with the like! You see, maybe I have this wierd twisted fetish for men like this?   And here I go, breaking everything down, analyzing it, for NOTHING!!! I am happy. I love my life.  I just don't speak his language. I said that to him too. 'I don't speak your language,' and he spoke to me in Thai, so I spoke back to him in French!    He has to compensate for his cantankerous personality through this illusion of good looks!  I saw his picture tonight; the mutual showed it to me.  I just looked at him, and I saw a very old man!  In the sense that e.e. cummings writes; 'When men insist they are always right, then they are old.'  I can't touch that; I can't break through that!       I don't want to either!  I just wish he wasn't getting to me; he's in me, in my gut, in my heart, and all over me like skin! Skin--Dammit!    Jumbled Chaos "

1421,Scorpio,"              Halp...  There are just some days when you come off feeling inadequate, and often times, insignificant. Tuesdays are those for me, often times 'coz the Exec. team meetings are long and arduous, and whatever little I contribute seem of even lesser importance.   But that's just today. Most times, it's pretty all right, it's just that being surrounded by thinkers and visionaries and perpetuators of God's kingdom is pretty intimidating. Plus the fact that it starts at 8.30 in the morning and coupled with the sore lack of sleep the previous night for goodness-knows-what reason.  Sometimes I question my calling in this ministry, this field. Where do I truly fit in, in all of this, in the ever-changing environment that I've been planted in? A lot of issues on self-worth and -centredness get thrown up in the mix, and I have to keep reminding myself that there's a greater purpose involved and at stake. To be honest, the sore lack of sitting down and meditating on his Word and doing my devotions is probably a key cause of this. Need discipline!!  Ah wells, just a bit of a whinge s'all.            "
1422,Leo,"           Everything I know, I learned by killing smart people and eating their brains  hey, go listen to 'mope' by the bloodhound gang. following is my favorite part of the song.

I'm high on crack! Wanna freebase?' band: 'No Pac-Man - Drugs are bad!' 'Nope, can't help you man.' Pac-Man: 'PUSSIES!' (sounds of someone taking a hit) WHOA! HOLY SHIT! (music is the Pac-Man theme over a drumline) (song resumes)  I also feel the need to quote Pantera now. Actually, I think I need to go to church, stand up in front of the choir, and sing this over the p.a.  Pantera, 'Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills' (mostly spoken, with a nasty 'i fucked your girlfriend last night' kind of drawl to it)  I fucked your girlfriend last night. While you snored and drooled, I fucked your love. She called me daddy and I called her baby when I smacked her ass.  I called her sugar when I ate her alive till daylight.  And I slept with her all over me, from forehead to ribcage I dripped her ass. Sometimes I thought you might be spying, living out some brash fantasy, but no. You were knocked out.  But we were all knocked out you know. In a way I serve too many masters. We didn't know you'd break the bottle that the magic came in to use those jagged shards to slit our wrists and neck. And you'd do it too, you're that kind of dude. But you wouldn't know what you were doing because I didn't, your girlfriend could have been a burn victim, an amputee, a dead body - But god damn I wanted to fuck. I'm serving too many fucking masters. I told you. I told you motherfucker          "

1424,Gemini,"        Great, Im back!  Last few days have been pretty good!  Spent all day Wednesday with my kids, had a fun day just veggin out in front of the t.v. watching movies & trying to stay cool.  Worked during the day today & everything went by rather quickly.  Did not even find time to be bored.  Branden showed up a 'little' late, hehe not to slam him but he called at 1 ish to say he over slept!  Was all good though everything got done & the day is over.  He felt pretty bad, & I really did not mind.  He's a good guy.   Found out from Kevin, one of the guys I work with at HW that I have some 'worm' that infects PC's if they are just, browsing the net!  Dont need to open an email or anything!  Wowzers, it was rebooting my pc every 5 minutes or so, whenever I would connect to the internet.  He was nice enough to tell me about it & had 2 floppys with the fix & prevention on them.  So, Im all good again, up and running.  Reason, I caught the virus?  Im a smuck & did not have the Windows XP default firewall running in the background...  I'll steal a page from Branden's blog & post my schedule for the next few days if anyone wants to know where I'll be.  Friday     :  9am - 2pm Taco John's / 3:30pm - 12:30am Hollywood Saturday:  Off Taco John's / Off Hollywood Sunday  :  Off Taco John's / 3:30pm - 12:30 am Hollywood  Hopefully I'll have fun this weekend, who knows?

I argue about whether its' necessary, then I'll argue about the extent of work that needs to be done.  What sucks is he is like 1% more stubborn than I am, so I eventually just say 'fuck it' and do whatever.  The kicker is when the response comes back and I was right in the first place.

1440,Gemini,"        With a conventional mechanical transmission gear shifts require an interruption of the connection between engine and gearbox which not only harms the comfort and the performances of the vehicle, but also represents a loss of kinetic energy. A shift under load, without disruption of the torque transmission is thus desirable. This is commonly performed by automatic transmissions composed of a hydrodynamic torque converter associated to planetary gear trains. But these automatic transmissions are complex, expensive and their efficiency remains lower than that of manual mechanical gearboxes. The simple and effective twin clutch concept invented by a brilliant French engineer before WW II has at last been developed and its mass production launched by VW and Audi. The competitors certainly do not intend to be left behind…   The new Octavia offers the truly revolutionary DSG technology (Direct Shift Gearbox) which combines the foremost benefits of a manual gearbox with the advantages of a traditional automatic transmission. The result is a smooth yet dynamic acceleration while providing excellent economy. Moreover you can choose between an automatic or manual Tiptronic versions.

1443,Capricorn,"                 I've realized that my life falls to pieces when I'm not reading a good book. You may think I'm exagerating, but I am in earnest. Every time I go for a month without reading a good old novel for myself (as opposed to for school) I start to get depressed, discontented, unmotivated, moody, and bored with life's daily tedious drone. I'm feeling that way right now because for over a month I haven't been reading anything for myself, but I'm thinking of reading Willa Cather's The Song of the Lark. It has a sentimental title, but I've heard it's really good and it's about a girl who lives in a rustic town and wants to be a singer. Already the main character has some similarities to myself.      "
1444,Aquarius,"       This past week was my Spring Break from school and I spent most of it tidying up loose ends and looking for a condo (not successfully).  All in all, not an exciting week considering that this time last year I was getting over my jet lag from London.   Last year that I had a longing to revisit my favorite city in all the world.  After my first tiring and horrendous year of teaching, I was planning on going backpacking through Europe with a girlfriend of mine, but she backed out.  Then, I thought I would spend a summer in London as a reward for getting through the fire, but I failed to ever find out how to rent a flat for a reasonable fee for a few months.  So, two years later, after 9/11 and with a pending war in Iraq, I decided that I would go to London, by myself.  There is a time when you realize waiting around for other people isn't worth it.    Luckily, British Airways had cheap tickets and AAA travel helped secure a great cheap hotel and off I went.  My family was not pleased AT ALL.  My brothers were convinced I would be blown up mid flight, my mother thought I would be killed on the streets, but I (and my therapist) thought why live in fear?  I almost backed out though, because at the time the war in Iraq was only a month old and I did get scared.  But I knew I had to get through the bit of fear for many reasons.  So, here is what got my on the plane; I thought, sure I can stay here and be safe and not take the risk and it will drive me crazy because the plane on which I have a reservation will be flying with or without me so I can be on it and be in London or sit here for a week and wish that I had gotten on it, because after all the worrying it didn't blow up.  So, I got on the plane and I loved every minute of it.    It was wonderful and fabulous and there are not enough cliched things to say.  I saw 4 West End shows and revisited my favorite spots and went to museums and shopped and loved it.  A good many people think that it was ballsy of me to go and to go alone.  I've never had that feeling about that trip.  My parents instilled great traveling skills in me and traveling just feels like breathing sometimes.  I love it and I must do it.  I think I am my best self when I am traveling.  I'm an easy traveler.  I don't stress about what the day will bring or getting through an itinerary because the best things happen when you don't plan.  There are too many stories to back up that statement, but the places and cities at the moment should be the tour guides, not a piece of paper or a set schedule.    I missed the traveling this break.  I had planned to treat Richmond as if I were a tourist this week and go to the historical places and museums that I've been meaning to go to, but the week slipped away from me and now I have a paper due.  Sometimes, the real world is not quite a nice as the magical, mystical, travel filled one inside my head.  Oh well, there are always books to take me there.  I'm currently (and just now) reading CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET by Sophie Kinsella, a British novelist.  I bought the book last year in Harrods of all places because I knew that it was not in the US yet and I enjoy her books.  They are the mindless Chick Lit type that a girl just needs sometimes (don't worry I also bought some Seamus Heaney).  So, I hadn't read it until now because I've been trying to read a little more high-brow (though not much more- maybe just a brow lift).  So, I got it out the other night and read a few chapters each day.  Then, in B&N the other day I saw it is out in hardback as a new release.  Funny, how it's not new to me at all and yet it is new, now.     Last year I took Kinsella's book SHOPOHOLIC TIES THE KNOT to London as I had just begun to read it before the trip.  It's about a girl who loves to shop (obviously) who is British, but lives in NYC, but goes back to England to get married (again, obvious).  I would take it on the Tube to read between stops because I also feel that when traveling, you don't need to always act like a tourist (do what the locals do, read on the Tube).  So, I was on the Circle line train going to Leicester Square by way of Embankment reading and reading and being nonchalant. The funny thing is that I was reading about the main character visiting her friend in London and going out for tea in Sloane Square when the train stopped and the doors opened and I heard the announcement of Sloane Square station.  Sometimes, the universe just aligns.  And, no, I don't believe in that crap, but sometimes... Sloane Square and Sloane Square meet and I just can't compete.           "

1447,Gemini,"           Fuck the corporations! I've been thinking about the ways that the music industry, and now the movie industry are attacking people who pirate their copyrighted goods. I'm going to start by throwing out a few thoughts that you've undoubtedly considered yourself, or in the very least have read many times before.  It's well known that most artists don't make much cash directly out of their album sales. So, for the average 'pirate', its basically a battle between them and a faceless corporation who are just out to make more money. The corporations don't retaliate by working towards getting the consumer to be enthusiastic about the product again, instead they're trying to imprison or at least put some fear into them.  That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Companies peddling other wares would kill to get the consumers to sample their products, what makes music any different? Logic dictates to me that if a consumer would rather steal your product rather than buy it from you, you should try to work out what makes it appealing to them. Adding more content makes it much more expensive to produce, so that's not necessarily an option. But surely there's a way to do it?  Yes, I've thrown out an oft-repeated question out there. But where am I leading with this?  Apparently Universal Music in the US have lowered their RRP on CD's. Logic is finally rearing its head. If consumers want to steal from you, why not lower the price down enough that its a no-brainer to spend just a couple of bucks more than the time and effort involved in pirating a disc. I'm sure the average person would rather spend a few bucks on a disc, rather than download 10-14 mp3's, convert them to wav's, then burn them to disc. You're wasting bandwidth, time, and a blank disc. I don't know if my high school economics is about to let me down here, but the average rule of supply and demand means that if you can get a lot more product out there, it can become cheaper. If its cheaper, chances are more people will buy it. You just have to market it correctly.  My purchase a few days ago of The Goodies on DVD have me thinking about TV shows on DVD. Why the heck do they tend to cost so much? Recently Fox did a pretty smart thing and released some X-Files, Futurama, Buffy, and Angel episodes on DVD for $15 a disc. Thats genius, but even so, lower the cost a little and mass-market the hell out of them. Charge, say, $8 for a disc with 2-3 episodes on it. Eight bucks for a few hours entertainment is perfectly fair. Its practically the same price as a video rental. Sell the discs everywhere from petrol stations to supermarkets, to department stores. People are sure to pick up at least one or two discs each week, if not more if they get really hooked on the show. There's so much product coming out of          "

Holen: wanna go out tonight? Me: no cash, man.  di pa ako binabayaran ng pebo ko  Holen: it's alright,  libre kita.  Me: Why? what's up? Holen: i wanna leave the house. Me: Ok!  I froze. But that was the start of a long night of drinking and gripe sessions about everything that is unfortunate in our lives. I won't divulge context of our discussion or how it ended. But i really just wanted to say:  It feels good to vent. For the longest period of time, i could never really say the things i want, and i felt pretentious being around people.  It's primarily the reason why i left my previous webjournal in livejournal.com, it was too crowded for me, it was so hard to be myself. It seemed that i always had to sugarcoat the things i had to say, for the sake of not pissing anyone of.   Now, i have you, i can be myself - i am free of the cares of people, my great escape.         "

1452,Aquarius,"           Went to work on thurs, expecting a slow & boring night... I went into the staff room, and plodded about a bit, then noticed quite a rough looking young guy bent over doing his laces! Wow quite fit, but i dint really think anything more at that moment. Eventually over the course of the night i got chatting a bit to him, but it was imposible to get him on his own. But found out that his name is C, he's 20, and studying Politics and french. The best way to decribe him is - you know the film Bring it on? Well C. looks like Cliff from the film! nice! he he and he drives an old volvo, but it all adds to his uniqueness.   Today i hoped he was working, but sadly no he wasnt. But he did decide to go for a swim, and wore little speedos with 'Australia' printed on his arse! nice! lol i did perve quite a bit, but then had to swap with R. After that C. decided to sit in reception and mess with the computer a bit. Me, R. and T. started chatin about ginger babies, well R. and T. did, and they said how ugly they thaight they were, then C. jumped in saying something similar to 'I think women with ginger hair are always beautiful' (yay) then the convo went on bla bla bla. But yey, soz im v.sad, but this kind of stuff excites me coz i have nothing else to do.  Also dad swaped my nice corsa for a shed of a peugeot 205. ITS SHAKES!!!! i'm so angry! it wasnt even his to start with, i payed for the  car , but dad seems to think he can swap it however he likes. My cd's were in the clio. Damn him! He goes on about little car's being death traps, and then he goes and gets me a shakey shed of an excuse for a car. Just becaus i've had theirs for over 2 weeks now, not letting them use it. But i was forced into buying the clio, and then found out that it over heated and needed over £150/£200 of work done to it. Silly man!!          "

'where did you get this body?' you asked me at least twice. inside your dreams. the smooth body of cupid is yours. paint us here, before the dance falls.  troglodyte vituperate sybaritic  you played the first act of Wagner's Parsifal--the CD with Peter and the Wolf. oh, your body was a marble statue of naked Cupid.  you told me: 'you are so beautiful.' but, love cannot be? why am i so sad? you are leaving--will i ever see you again, the way you said i would...? i can't count on it. no matter what, you will be dear to me always. you said: my one wish is to 'have a family' and you asked me to live with you over the summer...even to marry you, lol. of course, our last contract was to 'go with the flow.' the feeling i have of tears during Brahms' andante. it will pass like a kite through the leaves, barely touching their veins.  if you have more time to think, you will think against me--though my whole soul is for you as an angel emerging out of the tulip's purple petals into violent dusk. i cannot have but true feeling for you. your warm skin and statuesque form remind me that Casanova's figures can be given life. Galatea lived once, too. G-d Bless you all. mother working in the garden with a smile on her face...the birds chirping at 4 a.m. have a place in this too. xox to you, Peter.  of course, your reply contains no such xox. the joke's on me. cruelty is in everyone, a burning desire to vanquish the one who holds your heart.   you have exercised your right, as a tiger would, extinct in your precision, wise in your decision to shut me out. why not be prudent with a fat girl like me? fuck you, too, honey, and take your stupid dick elsewhere. have a nice life.  i have the honey ingrained in my leaves, a moment of hell needed to deceive, a heart through a wire festering on a spear of hope. you have the  cleanest cuts, the words protected from pain, the olive skin for the desert sun. what have i done? given myself away as a drummer  crashes his drum, washed your feet as a sinner washes those of Sin. bitter, my blisters multiplying in the growing heat, i walk away from the idea of you, almost protected now from further surprise, feeling sick enough to kill what little love i have left. i should have struck you instead of kissed you, and in the dark, taken your soul to cast into the flames. what have i now but regrets? what have i now but the  certainty of further pain?

I might add a picture to my profile, that is if I do conjure up the bravery to do so.  I've deleted all the entries before the last one as I feel they sounded a tad bit dull to be honest, I think most of them followed the pattern of, 'I'm so bored, there is nothing to do' when I know well that I didn't even try to find or do something interesting atfer complaining about it.

At times, I still yearn to work with those kids again.  I'm damn good at it, but the culture of Autism is too abrasive for me.  It's a complicated, long story.  I love the kids, it's just everything that surrounds them and thus henders a teacher's effectiveness was too much for me.  I like what I do now, but not sure if I love it.

1465,Gemini,"       Tuesday morning I crawled out of bed about noon and was confronted with yet another test of my strength. My mother announced to me that she thinks she had a heart attack two days before. She had called the doctor, but could not get an appointment until Friday morning. It is now Thursday afternoon, and I have been feeling like an elephant has been kickboxing my chest ever since. Memories of the times I spent sitting in emergency rooms and waiting rooms of ICUs came flooding back to me. I have a big ache in the pit of my stomach. I know no matter what happens, it will be ok. I just want to know something now, not tomorrow and not next week.  Oh well, such is the life I lead. I'm at the library, where I usually am when I decide to pound out a rant. I just tried to access nerve.com. I was not allowed access due to content. That of course makes me curious what kind of content is on it, that I am not allowed to view? I guess the sex survey done by the unemployed for this week, may be it...but is it really that different than the stuff on slate.com? Where are they drawing the line? I love lines....they lead to slippery slopes. Slippery slopes are fun...because you never know how far down people and morality will fall.  My hands hurt, from hours of typing, and my eyes ache from staring at the screen. Why do we subject ourselves to spending hours in front of a keyboard, only to communicate with people who are no where near us? Why do we race home from work, or school to check e-mail from people we see everyday? Why do we seek this validation?  If anyone has any answers to my questions...please let me know. I am sick of trying to answer them for myself.          "

1471,Libra,"                 Someone please explain to me how someone can become so far gone as to set their 3 children on fire, along with their mother and themselves?  If you didn't hear, a guy in Seattle poured gas on himself and his ex-girlfriend and their 3 children, ages 6 months, 1 1/2 and 2 1/2, as they were driving down the road.  The car then crashed and he jumped out, on fire, and started firing guns.  He and the kids died at the scene, the woman lived for 8 hours and was able to tell authorites what happened.  She had recently filed assault charges against the man.  I have 4 children, ages 10, 8, 2, and 6 months.   I can't even fathom a situation where I would intentionally do something like that to them.  They are the most important things in my life.  Anyone who tried to harm them I would kill with no hesitation and no remorse.  How could I possibly injure or kill them?  I could never be that far gone.  Or evil.  I realize the Bible says all sin is the same in God's eyes, and hell is as hot for one soul as another, but being human, I can't help but hope their is a little hotter corner of hell for this person, and people like him.  And I pray the children were asleep and never knew what happened, just woke up in Heaven.             "
1472,Capricorn,"           Okay that's it, I am in love, just wanted to tell all the guys who already kindda knew about it...and all the others! Dumped the girl for me. I am in love. Gracias a Barcelona where we made it for the first time ;) . Gracias a Barcelona who gave me the courage (and the alcohol) to jump on him. At last.  Gracias at that boy who waited for me 3 yrs (yes...). I am in love when I thought everything was over... I ll always remember our first kiss on Passeig de Gracia... Calls me sweetheart, honey and all the stuff, and i dont even think it s stupid! VIVA BARCELONA (and the crazyness it gave me)...         "
1473,Libra,"       Today I dropped off two blouses and two pairs of pants at the dry cleaner's so that they're nice and fresh for me to wear this upcoming weekend. They're clothes I bought within the last couple weeks. I love new clothes.  I love how couture nowadays includes styles inspired by the 1920s and the 1950s, even mixing the 1920s and 1950s together. I just love that. Those decades particularly intrigue me, the 1920s because of the whole flapper girl, Charleston dance thing, and the 1950s because of the whole 'I Love Lucy' thing and whatnot. Weren't the 1950s a backlash against the 1920s, interestingly enough? I also like the late 1800s, early 1900s Gibson girl thing; I wonder what the chances are of styles from that period being voguishly reincarnated.   I'm driving about three hours north to San Luis Obispo Friday evening to attend a friend's twin sister's wedding on Saturday. I'm staying at my friend's place along with a friend of hers until Sunday. After church and lunch with my friend and her friend on Sunday, I'm driving two and a half or so hours further north to the Monterey Peninsula to meet my ex-boyfriend at a restaurant for dessert, and then I'm driving back to LA. I don't know how long I'll be hanging out with my ex - probably not long, because chances are he doesn't like me much - I called him up and asked him to go out for dessert with me, because I really miss him and still love him, and he said yes probably just to be nice. If I were to never call him and never drive up to see him, I would never hear from him or see him. We broke up at the beginning of last December, and I'm still not over him. I still throw fits over him. I didn't want to break up. I'm still having a difficult time dealing with it.  I find that I really like going on road trips and driving long distances by myself as long as it's a leisurely drive (i.e., not for the purpose of meeting a dreaded or important appointment), I know where I'm going (i.e., I don't get lost), and I have music that I'm really into. If I couldn't have music in the car, then a road trip would be painful and pointless. It's all about the music. I like road trips much, much better during the day than at night because the day is so much more scenic. On a road trip at night, the world is a black mass.  Today I bought three domain names, of course with money I don't have. Three just to have like pretty trinkets and baubles, because I like pretty trinkets and baubles. I think I'll use them in the creation of different Web design concepts for my portfolio. A design concept certainly doesn't require a domain name, but the domain name contributes to the look and feel of a site in the way that the title of a poem or song helps set the mood for the poem or song. I love the canned template of this blog - it's an inspiration to me. I'm really digging this color scheme - if it were clothing, I would really rejoice in wearing it. I will definitely steal this color scheme. I wanted to buy a fourth domain name - Shepherdess.com, but that's taken. I registered the domain names with DynoNames.com, but I think I want HostGator.com to host them, and I want reseller Web hosting - I just need to figure out which reseller package I want.  Watched the movie  Along Came Polly  on DVD with my sister. It's cute - I enjoyed it. I usually shun romantic comedies.         "
1474,Cancer,"           I was at school today at 11:00 am..... tomorrow I have to be there at 9:30 am! Oy! It's depressing 'cause school hasn't even started yet and I've been there almost every day. But ya I was there for like 4 hours today and ya first off I came in my pajamas...... but ya then I got home and watched tv and fell asleep at 3:15 and woke up at 5, it was nice, and then I watched more tv until like 9 when someone finally called and asked if I wanted to do something, so ya I hung out with joesphine, freddie, and and gabby (gandy), nick, and kate, but mostly jo and fred 'cause everyone left early. I hate drama. I haven't had to deal with it for like a year or since jr. high 'cause that's when everyone was stupid and talked shit about everyone. But I'm starting to realize that is coming about again. It has to deal with 2 people, one person I just don't give a shit about 'cause they're mean, but they're still apart of it all. So if you're really good friends with someone you tell them like everything, well at least that's what I do and a lot of my friends, but lately one of my good friends haven't been telling me anything that's happening between her and this shithead, whom he and I have history. Like you've gotta tell you're friends if a relationship is happening with anyone, and if you're a good friend you woudln't let a relationship happen with anyone that your good friend has history with. Well this friend, is basically going behind my back and I'm starting to get really pissed off. Another thing is that she's trying to start like excluding me from like hanging out with our 'group' and I was actually the one to introduce her to the group, like before if whoever called me to hang out I'd call her to have her come with now if they call her first she never calls me even though she told me that that day she'd hang out with me, well she doesn't call me right away but not until like 9, I think she does that to piss me off.... and ya it's working! But she needs to start getting over herself and start thinking about her close friends 'cause soon, it'll all go down. Drama sucks balls.  I think I may have made progress on a homecoming date..... Fred thought up 4 people for me and he's gonna try getting the 'connections' with one of them, it is Fred though so we'll see. Hopefully something happens! Just a reminder there's 7 days left of school! The countdown begins! : )~Kati         "
1475,Virgo,"   A conversation ensued between a 'more or less supporter of NPP' and me regarding the objectivity of baptism regardless of personal faith ever being present in the person baptized.  It seems as if I've heard this numerous times from such NPP sympathizers.  In this latest conversation, this person told me that baptism was efficacious regardless of faith ever being present.  I guess we must define 'efficacious' when used in such a way.  Are we equivocating when speaking of the efficacy of the sacrament for the reprobate and elect?  I do not know.  All I do know is that one absolutely cannot claim the heritage and teachings of John Calvin if one asserts baptism is efficacious without faith.  The conversation revolved around Calvin's view of the efficacy of baptism from the Geneva Catechism (the Latin translation of 1545).  I was somewhat unfamiliar with the catechism, but am thankful I was forced to review it to actually see what Calvin DID teach regarding the objectivity of baptism in relation to the efficacy of it from the Gevena Catechism.  It is overwhelmingly clear John Calvin taught baptism was only efficacious if accompanied by faith, but that faith could either precede or follow the sacrament for efficacy.  Either way, though, if faith--before or after the adminstration of the sacrament--was not possessed by the person, then baptism was of NO value or efficacy in relation to 'union with Christ.'  The 1545 Latin version translated into English can be found  urlLink here .  There is a version wherein the questions and answers are numbered, rather than labeled 'Master' and 'Student,' denoting who is asking and who is answering.  That version can be found  urlLink here .  Either of these are good resources for further studies, devotions, reflections, and the like.  Here are some examples of Calvin's view of the efficacy of the sacraments.  What must ALSO be noted is Calvin's clear distinction between the sign, the thing signified, and the power of God using the instrument of the sacraments.  The sign is never the thing signified, and the thing signified is only present through the sign if faith is present in the person.   Master . - But what confidence can there be in the sacraments as a means of establishing the conscience, and what certain security can be conceived from things which the good and bad use indiscriminately?    Scholar . - Although the wicked, so to speak, annihilate the gifts of God offered in the sacraments in so far as regards themselves, they do not thereby deprive the sacraments of their nature and virtue.    Master . - How, then, and when does the effect follow the use of the sacraments?    Scholar . - When we receive them in faith, seeking Christ alone and his grace in them.    Master . - Why do you say that Christ is to be sought in them?    Scholar . - I mean that we are not to cleave to the visible signs so as to seek salvation from them, or imagine that the power of conferring grace is either fixed or included in them, but rather that the sign is to be used as a help, by which, when seeking salvation and complete felicity, we are pointed directly to Christ.    Master . - Seeing that faith is requisite for the use of them, how do you say that they are given us to confirm our faith, to make us more certain of the promises of God?    Scholar . - It is by no means sufficient that faith is once begun in us. It must be nourished continually, and increase more and more every day. To nourish, strengthen, and advance it, the Lord instituted the sacraments. This indeed Paul intimates, when he says that they have the effect of sealing the promises of God. (Rom. iv. 11.)    Master . - But do you attribute nothing more to the water than that it is a figure of ablution?    Scholar . - I understand it to be a figure, but still so that the reality is annexed to it; for God does not disappoint us when he promises us his gifts. Accordingly, it is certain that both pardon of sins and newness of life are offered to us in baptism, and received by us.    Master . - Is this grace bestowed on all indiscriminately?    Scholar . - Many precluding its entrance by their depravity, make it void to themselves. Hence the benefit extends to believers only, and yet the Sacrament loses nothing of its nature.   Calvin's exposition and defense of infant baptism, too, requires faith in order for any baptism of an infant to be efficacious.  Let those who claim baptism is efficacious to believers and non-believers (in the same way, or in any way at all) be assured that they do not adhere to the historically reformed position of baptism; the sign and seal; the sign and the thing signified; or the likes.  As long as those who argue for a view contrary to Calvin and the reformed admit it is contrary, I am a happy man.  Let those who hold such a view contrary to Calvin, who claim Calvin, be forgiven of their lies and blatantly false misrepresentations.       "
1476,Scorpio,       关于悉尼的生活水平之高，略有耳闻，这次终于亲身体验了一次。 从机场到预定的酒店，全程大约30分钟左右的车程，一路上计价表狂跳，到达的时候已经是60澳元了(1澳元=6.0人民币)，相比之下新加坡的车费真是便宜太多了，当初从机场到学校，还是临晨需要加价的情况下，也才20多新元(1新元=5.0人民币)。公交巴士也是新加坡的几倍，一两站就要1.6元，3，5站就2.7元；也许是因为司机的劳动量大点，需要收钱找钱。地铁更是不得了，从市中心到机场的地铁票居然要12元，快赶上直接打的了。澳洲的公交系统，真是摆明了宰人的嘛。  吃的在澳洲就更加贵得离谱了，唐人街的一碗面就是标价8元左右，如果在新加坡的话，最多4元就了不得了呀，在学校吃的话就更便宜了。怪不得我的一个自费的朋友，在墨尔本读书的，每天回家自己做饭，真是值得同情呀。  在澳洲的时间短，住的价位还是不太清楚，租房的话，一般都是120元左右一周(一个房间)。比较起来，比新加坡稍贵一点。其他的关于房价什么的，就不太清楚了，因为澳洲福利还比较好，应该会比新加坡好点。  总的来说，澳洲(或者说悉尼)生活消费实在是太高，但是收入却不是特别多，但是所幸福利还好，再加上美丽的城市风景，惬意生活也是比较畅快的。

1478,Pisces,"                 Okay y'all- my project for the last few weeks was to figure out my finances.  I have learned a bit, many of you might already know a lot, but if you don't- I suggest you figure out you bizness now!  I am poor now and don't want to be poor later!!!    What I learned:  1. Save the first hour of your salary every day and put it into a mutual fund.  2. Open up a Roth IRA for retirement purposes.  3. Be involved in investing said mutual fund and make it grow!!  This is a public service announcement brought to you by the letters- A and J and by the company 'Make lot of money so I can visit your ass in exotic places, Inc.'  No seriously, I don't want any of us to be broke and old- that would be horrible- and on another related note- during this election year we should get more involved in what is going on with our generation because the incumbent and candidate won't really care about us unless we make our voices heard.  We are too young to be apathetic!   Plus we are getting royally screwed as of now!  No social security for us, a huge national debt and having to deal with the old baby boomers!  Take it to the head!  Get involved but at the very least, we must all vote.  Except for you, Mambo, you don't get to play- you're Canadian!                 "

1481,Taurus,"           Went out to  urlLink Chino Hills  with some of the  urlLink Team Basso  guys this morning.  Up at 6, small breakfast (my undoing), out the door by 7, riding by 8:30.  Rides with these guys typically go 12 miles or so - decent pace when you're actually riding, but some group members like to be more social than others - so you can rely on taking breaks every few miles or so.  What I'm tryin to say is the rides are never slug-fests.  After riding for a couple hours riding with the main pack (about 10 of us), we come to the fork in the road, easy home = left, more riding = right.  I'm feelin pretty good, crunching people on hills and I think I'm having a good day - so, right it is with 3 other guys.    At that point, its about 10:30 and heading into the hottest part of the day (hindsight = 20/20).  After dicking around being lost for about an hour or so, we find this 3.5 mile downhill run.  Sweet you say, save your energy... nope.  The rule in mountain biking goes, what you go down, you must go up.  Also, you gotta get your ass off the seat, which means all your weight is on your quads.  At the bottom of the hill we made the mistake of stopping - both my quads went out like Michael J. Fox in jenga.  I literally had to  punch  the back of my knee's to unlock the cramps.  Little did I know we probably had about 3,000 feet of elevation to climb.  LOL.  After borrowing a GU from a buddy, and stealing another's water, we set out on our way.  At this point, I've already stopped sweating (dehydrated), I'd had the chills for about an hour (dehydrated), was getting dizzy (dehydrated), and was about to  urlLink bonk  (not enough calories/sugar), all in 100 degree heat that isn't letting up (dehydrated).  My only thought, 'I'm fucked'.  Needless to say, I got home, and in the event you are writing this off as me being a drama queen, see below.       That's almost 4 beats per second folks.  Per  second .  If that  still  doesn't mean anything to you,  urlLink read this .     UPDATE :  The graph of my ride.

1483,Pisces,"             Acumen brought the pain to NYC and the way I am feeling this morning, the pain has been brought. First off, thanks to The Significant Other for putting up with the madness even though she had to be at work at 7am this morning. She probably doesn't read this, but she is appreciated. Having 5 guys crash in our tiny pad is not the most logical or easy.  Because of the graduation party for Ciao Baby and his sister, S.O. and I were late for the acu-gig. We missed the DJA? set, but got the full brunt of the rawk. I was quite pleased with the set list, especially since they played my old favorite, fuckface, which came out around the time the acumen/aggression (back when it was me and PH) pally-dom started. Such memories. I think. Anyway, the new songs are good and despite the lack of the ILC material, I was happy to see them for what they will never understand was a good and appreciative crowd for NYC. Also, I remain a huge fan of the Acumen rythmn section. Dan Brill blows my mind on drums and I'm not just saying that because he was sporting an aggression T-shirt onstage. He's no Robin though, but someday maybe he can try to be as good ;-)....  It was nice to see some familiar faces, like the kids from the message boards and thanks to Aaron the Pak for buying Irene and I some drinks. It took him 7 years to get around to it, but he did it, even though he is from a town made fun of on Sex In the City. the shock of the night was running into Charlie from Form, who just moved to NY from Dayton (Charlie and his bandmate Paul did a great remix for us on our newest single). And to Charlie, also, thanks for the drink.  Late night drinks were had locally, which of course led to the usual debates/discussions/rows, etc. and which of course leads to the one thing men need in the morning..Egg bitches. You can email Jason Novak about that one.  And now, a round of apologies....  First, to Matt Gentile. Acumen played 'Gun Lover'. I was told they weren't going to. Forgive me. it was good.  Second, to Ryan 'The Sarcastic Bastard', who drank sour low fat milk in my house. I can't feel THAT sorry for Ryan as he CHOSE to be the merch guy for Acumen. That's masochism enough. No wonder why he's drinking whiskey at 11 in the morning.  Ok, gotta clean this place up now. rrrrr.  F           "

Gonna feel damn sick cause I hate Maths. =/ As usual, I chill around wif my classmates to 'study' but end up eating in the canteen. ^^ I reached home at about 5pm and started sleeping. Zzzzz.... Woke up at 7.30pm to eat my DINNER!! I'm feeling sleepy again... Haiz. How on Earth am I gonna study Maths in this manner? Well, i guess this Mid-Year Exams wouldn't really help me in my promotion exams at the end of the year. Just hope a small miracle would happen. Well, I always believe that some things are just fated. Though we can manipulate fate in some manner, still, fate plays a major role in our lives.

Inevitably, something always does. So, in the spirit of making dealing with tickets a bit more palatable, a few of us here have taken to writing and including haiku in or about our ticket responses.

1494,Sagittarius,"        And My Day Continues to Improve  I may have mentioned before that I have one of the greatest bosses ever.   urlLink  Just one example of his great sense of humor.      Well, today he was the subject of a photo for a local newspaper.  He's not normally in the office until around 1pm on Thursdays, so seeing him at 8:30 threw me way off track.  He was waiting for the photographer to arrive.  So picture this:  A very professional hotel executive, grey wool suit, conservative tie and starched white shirt.  Well groomed 40-something trim and good-looking man (I love a man in a suit!).  Barefoot. *huh?*  Then, he stepped waist-deep into our 2nd swimming pool, and waded over to the middle of the pool.  I'm ready for my close up, Mr. DeMille.  Yes - in the pool with his shades on, in his suit.  It was so much fun to watch, and everyone around the pool was enjoying the view.  When the shoot was over, the view got even better.  Ladies and Gentleman, I have seen my boss in his underwear.  I may be changed for life.  And, nice package *wink*.  I hope I didn't say that out loud.  Well, Valentines Day may be a wash, but today was so much better.  Oh, yeah.  And now there's some guy named Ah-nold lounging around that same pool.  Yes, THE Arnold.  With his arm in a sling from an injury trying to do some stunt.  But for me, the true star has already left the building.  Diva out.         "
1495,Libra,"       Friends can surprise you. You can be surprised. Everything was fun. The Band. The really crappy-gay 80's board games. Sitting at the end of her driveway at 1 a.m. The deep convos. Cold Pizza. Sparklers. 'Coke-a-Cola.' Yelling out the window like a retard at Ryan, Jon and T.J. Barb-b-cue Chips.  I thought. 'Hey dummy, it's new years. I need resolutions. Cool resolutions.' So, I thought what better place to put them but my blog-of-fame. Or, blog-of-shame. 1.) Forget about any feelings I have previously felt for *shall remain silent*  2.) Become a in-cogneto-super-hero. (anime-style. ah-hahaha.) With select powers I will list after..*grin*  3.) Become more self-confident.  4.) Loose (atleast) 10 lbs. (I kno, I had to throw it in!!)  Thats about it. I only want to make those I think I can accomplish! And I think those are pretty good. Ok. Now I'll elaborate on the super-powers. The power to fly. ( a must!) Ablity to teleport! (totally awesome) MindReading. (another must) Immortality. (^^) The power to make guys fall in love. Any guy. *wink* I think thats about all for right now. I'll for surley come up with some more later on. I'll update again then too. Ugh! School starts again in 4 days. That is Monday. Too soon. I don't want to deal with *HIS* bitchass and the problems that risen over break. Oh, well. I guess I'll say enough is enough cuz it's not comming back from him. I can't win. I need to stop expecting change.     "
1496,Libra,"           My little Haus Meri that I mentioned last email came on Tuesday morning and she stayed the whole day, cleaned everything in sight.  I gave her a tip of 2 Kina (big of me I know).  I felt guilty about her staying all day as I didn't have a key to give her to lock up and leave, so I did walk back home at lunchtime and asked her if she wanted to go home, but she wouldn't have a bar of it saying she still had clothes to iron, floors to mop.  She wanted to come on Thursday as well, but I told her once a week is plenty, for a single guy.  I have met quite a few of the other Volunteers around, who are from VSO (British mob) and GDS (German Development Service).  A couple of the VSO guys are actually working at the uni, and one has a car.  I have already buttered up to him and have managed to jump on board for a few trips into town, which has been handy and means that I have now stocked my fridge with a slab of SP Lagers (the local brew, tastes like cat's piss, but you get used to it).   Well my next-door neighbour Martin and myself are trying to organise a joint house warming party for this weekend, for all the local volunteers to get together and christen our places.  Martin only moved in just before Christmas and then went back to Oz for a month.  We should have had it organised for last saturday, but I have not got my phone connected yet and Martin's has been dead.  Trying to get Telikom to do anything is like trying to get Telstra to do something.  Work has changed gears and instead of being in Neutral we are now moving along in First.  Last week I built 6 old donated laptops that I needed to give to the site coordinators who came for a seminar.  This was no mean feat, as out of the 20 laptops we had, only about half work. I also had to give a little presentation on the technology we are going to be using, for the project, which went down pretty well.  It looks like my first trip around the country should be in a few weeks, and the destination is lovely Manus Island a few hundred k's north of the mainland near the equator.  It is supposed to quite pretty with great places to swim, which will be good as Lae doesn't have any.  Martin has offered to lend me his snorkel, goggles and flippers.  It is pretty tough, but someone has to do it.  The reason for going is just to collect some old radio equipment that DODL set up about 6 years ago, but they never use, so I will probably fly up and then catch the boat back.  Well the staff club has opened up, which is conviently located on the walk back home.  They have a TV there that I think will suffice for me to catch the news occasionally.  It is amusing over here in the fact that if you join any club (Golf, Workers etc) they give you a key to the front door, not sure why though.  Having no TV has not fazed me yet and I have not really missed, I might even be able to get away with not needing one at all.  We shall see.  Books have been my main source of entertainment, and the library is well stocked.  I shall probably get a decent laptop soon through work so I can watch all my movies that I have brought along.  My Pidgin is slowing coming along.  All the guys in the office want to help me out and they have decided to speak to me only in Pidgin.  This has been half successful as they soon forgot and went back to speaking English to me.  I have been asking questions on how to say things and phrases and as I said it is slowly coming along.  Pidgin is a bit of laugh, when you read signs around the place.  Went for a trip on Saturday up the valley, where there are quite a number of cattle properties.  Signs along the way warning about cattle straying onto the road say, 'Luk Aut: Bulamakau long rot!' (say it as it is spelt).  As a side note, Bull is 'Man Bulamakau' and Cow is 'Meri Bulamakau'.  It is pretty funny.  Another thing that cracks me up is that people here don't buy cigarettes by the packet, but individually.  Your waiting in line to get something from the Kiosk and the guy in front asks for 3 smokes and the girl opens up a packet and pulls out 3 and hands them to him.

1497,Leo,"             I took a 'Color Quiz'. Here's my results. YIKES! Check it out at www.colorquiz.com   Your Existing Situation Unwilling to extend herself or exert undue effort (with the possible exception of sexual activity). Feels that further progress requires more from her than she is willing or able to give. Would prefer reasonable comfort and security rather than the rewards of greater ambition.  Your Stress Sources Wants to overcome a feeling of emptiness and to bridge the gap which she feels separates herself from others. Anxious to experience life in all its aspects, to explore all its possibilities, and to live it to the fullest. She therefore resents any restriction or limitation being imposed on her and insists on being free and unhampered.  Your Restrained Characteristics Believes that she is not receiving her share--that she is neither properly understood or adequately appreciated. Feels that she is being compelled to conform, and close relationships leave her without any sense of emotional involvement. Feels that she is receiving less than her share and that there is no one on whom she can rely for sympathy and understanding. Pent-up emotions and a certain egocentricity make her quick to take offense, but she realizes that she has to make the best of things as they are.  Your Desired Objective Needs a change in her circumstances or in her relationships which will permit relief from stress. Seeking a solution which will open up new and better possibilities and allow hopes to be fulfilled.  Your Actual Problem Feels restricted and prevented from progressing; seeking a solution which will remove these limitations.  Your Actual Problem .2 The fear that she may be prevented from achieving the things she wants leads her into a relentless search for satisfaction in the pursuit of illusory or meaningless activities.

1498,Libra,"       Phew!!!  what a day./.....   Its week 12 at uni this week, so I am trying to organise 12 weeks worth of notes for 3 subjects and do all the reading, questions and learning..  Today wasn't bad considering it is my least favourite day. Something good happened for a change, which was good and has given me renewed confidence in myself.   It started yesterday though, when I got back an assignment I had worked hard on . The mark on the paper was 55. My tutor said she wanted to see me and said that it was one of the best reports she had read, and that it was well written and argued.   I thought to myself, 'am i hearing this right?'.. and told her I wasn't happy and that I wanted something to happen. I asked her if i could re do the assignment and she said she;d ask ...   so needless to say I was pretty fired up yesterday afternoon. ...  whilst on this fired up trippy thing i wrote email to the lecturer and course coordinator requesting to see him to talk about it..  long story short I went today and got him to read it and it was remarked too.. got 70!!!  I almost fell off my seat!!   The moral of the story is that if you know yourself, then no one can tell you otherwise. I knew I was capable of more than a 55  - I usually get average marks like 70 and in this case I knew it was worth about that...   Hehehe... what a day!   ;P         "
1499,Virgo,"       Finally, my blog is out!! Feels weird to find myself making a blog though... Lol. Boring day today. Sux2beme.  Still kinda pissed to know that England lost to Portugal. That Beckham is a bloody dickhead, taking a penalty as though it was a free-kick. Nevertheless, it didn't dampen my mood to play Shattered Galaxy(SG)!! Taking damn bloody long to max stats and get my units to max lvl.  Gotta do homework before my chem teacher, Mdm Koh, starts running up to me saying :'Stay back and do your work!' ;( Lastly, must thank Qifang for guiding me through the process of making this blog. ^^  Thanks alot, Qifang ~         "

Where's  urlLink NOW , when you need 'em I say?   Very original, and it appears to be working (damnit).  I (with the help of  urlLink Libbo  kicking me in the toofises) came up with the also very original, and very brilliant idea of beating  urlLink Frank  at his own game.  So, again, with  urlLink Libbo  doing all the heavy lifting (I'm fat, remember), he designed the  urlLink first ever 'Fat Kid' t-shirt !!!       urlLink  BUY IT HERE!

1501,Cancer,"           Only a hopeless romantic could take such a movie as Win a Date with Tad Hamilton into relieve and wish all that could happen to you. Yup, that's me, if you didn't know by now I'm a hopeless helpless romantic. I'm not saying I want to enter a contest to win a date with a hollywood star and then have them all in love with me, I'm just saying that I want to find someone. One scene in the movie was where this one girl was telling this guy who was in love with this other girl that everybody has their Tad Hamilton, everybody is a Tad Hamilton to somebody. They may not be a star in real life, but somebody is a star to someone else and somebody has that little spot for a star in their hearts. I just want to be that star and be that Tad Hamilton to somebody and I want somebody to be a Tad Hamilton to me, I want to find my Tad.   It's pathetic though, Larissa and I were talking about how many guys I just pass by or go through, it's kind of depressing too that I haven't even gone out with any of them, there was only one guy that I felt something for out of all of them but still nothing happened. Let's see I think we counted 6 guys that I could have had a relationship with and that I didn't with any. Interesting, very interesting..... I wonder what that says about me. Well if you've read in my blog before, I've already pondered this and realized that maybe it's just because I'm waiting for that movie scene, that perfect person and person place, and that I'm not going to get it, but set on the idea that I will. I am getting better though, I'm starting to get little crushes again and am trying to work my way back into someones arms.  I don't realize how much I like dancing until I actually dance. Dances are so fun, but ya if you don't take advantage of them it wont be fun at all, if you don't dance, there's no point, and if you don't dance with people, even less of a point. The point of a dance is to have fun with all your friends and to socialize, it gives you the opportunity to dance with maybe the one person, the only person you've ever wanted to dance with, and no one is going to care who you dance with either, it doesn't matter if you know every single person at the dance, not one person is going to judge you for dancing with someone, if they do, that's just not cool. But I love the fact that dancing takes your mind off of everything and you can make up your own world.    Man bye to the closing of valentines day weekend, started it off with winning a hockey game and ended it with a chick flick, ya one more day before school, but doing hw all day doesn't really count. Oh and for those of you wondering, I sadly didn't find my prince charming, well maybe I did meet him last night, I just don't know it. Nothing special like my dreams or in fairy tales once again, but good never the less.   muah *Kati          "

1508,Capricorn,"                 When I don’t post it’s usually because of this:  I wanted to watch a movie, And check a site on-line,  But then my mother told me,  “You can’t! Look at the time.”  “It’s half past ten,” my mother said, “It’s time for you to be in bed.” I never liked that clock, I thought. And now I wish that it would stop.  When my homework is complete, My Mother says to go to sleep! And always when my work is done, There’s no more time for any fun.

1509,Cancer,"       Without the snow.  And the giant tree.  And the blinding lights.  Ok, so it doesn't look a lot like Christmas around here.  Yet.  Have y'all seen those pine cones that are cinnamon scented?  Mmmmm yum!  Those are awesome.  I found them at Michael's and WalMart both.  However, they are a bit bunged up.  I'm kind of obsessive that way.  I don't like for things to be messed up in anyway, especially not something you have on display in your home.  So, I didn't buy any.  Instead, I thought to myself 'Self, you can MAKE these for a whole lot less money and have them look a whole lot better.'  And the kids will have fun at the park pickin up pine cones.  We always go feed them to the prairie dogs anyway.  May as well throw a few in a sack and bring em home and cook em up.  Then it will at least begin to smell a whole lot like Christmas.           "
1510,Capricorn,                 Does a writer have to experience much of what he writes about to write about it well? Can a person who is not an adult write about adults convincingly? Does one have to have experience in the world to write about it?

1516,Sagittarius,"        urlLink Plagiarist.com Poetry � Archive � Mark Strand � 'The Room'  This poem is from Mark Strand's BLIZZARD OF ONE, which won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1999.  ***************************************    Old Man Leaves Party  It was clear when I left the party That though I was over eighty I still had A beautiful body. The moon shone down as it will On moments of deep introspection. The wind held its breath. And look, somebody left a mirror leaning against a tree. Making sure that I was alone, I took off my shirt. The flowers of bear grass nodded their moonwashed heads. I took off my pants and the magpies circled the redwoods. Down in the valley the creaking river was flowing once more. How strange that I should stand in the wilds alone with my body. I know what you are thinking. I was like you once. But now With so much before me, so many emerald trees, and Weed-whitened fields, mountains and lakes, how could I not Be only myself, this dream of flesh, from moment to moment?                    *************************************** >From BLIZZARD OF ONE by Mark Strand. © 1998 by Mark Strand.

1521,Aquarius,"                  So Sad   Today was one of those days where I felt like I really didn't get anything done. I think it's because I didn't sleep very well last night. Last night was the first night we slept on our new mattress, and it's sooo comfortable! I kept waking up throughout the night and thinking, 'wow this is so comfortable!' I have no idea why I kept waking up though! I must have been concerned about whether the new mattress would work out or not so I think I kept waking up to make sure I was really comfortable...or something! So I was kind of groggy today.  Well, it was a sad night on American Idol tonight. George went home. I knew he wouldn't win, but I was hoping he'd make it to the last three. He's such a friendly guy.

1528,Capricorn,"                 There has been a great amount of discussion due to the proposal of some of the Southern Baptists to remove their children from the public schools. At this point I will not argue my entire side of the issue, mainly because I don’t have time, but I just want to briefly reflect on one point. One reason people give to keep their children in the public schools is so that they can be a light to the world. They consider putting their children in a Christian school or home-schooling them, as hiding them under a bushel. Or they say it would be ignoring the Great Commission to put them there, unable to interact with and shine among non-Christians. This is not true because:  1. The whole point of school is to get an education; it is a time of learning and development on the child’s part. The main point of going to school is not to evangelize. Also, putting children in a Christian school, or home-schooling them, does not mean that they have no opportunities to interact with non-Christians.  2. Putting a child in the public school from Kindergarten through high school means they will be spending much of the day in the secular world, more than they spend in Church, Sunday School, youth group, prayer and devotions put together. Without the time spent in a Christian environment how are they to evangelize well, anyway?  3. Putting Christian children in public schools brings in a lot of competition for the parents. They have to compete with their children’s exposure to all the enticing temptations of the secular world. Even if Christian children avoid the temptations, they will certainly not try to evangelize and mark themselves out, risking seclusion. Peer pressure like that from Kindergarten is not healthy for a young Christian’s growth, and if a Christian child is weak, how can we expect strong evangelism?  4. From a scientific perspective, it is unwise to put Christians in the public schools because it will only make them weaker in one part of evangelism: the public schools teach the theory of evolution as a fact rather than a theory. Even if they refer to it as a theory they offer no alternatives. Christians, then, will have no knowledge of the Creationist theory, and will not know all of the scientific evidence against evolution and for Creationism. This will leave them very weak, and ignorant. And if they try to evangelize later on, this could be a very weak point.  5. The triumphs and down falls in Christian History are not taught in the public schools, nor are they taught in Sunday Schools. (The Sunday Schools have a hard enough time combating with what the kids are bombarded with in the public schools to even think about teaching Christian History.) Where are Christian children ever to learn about their heritage? The children of the secular world will have more training in their beliefs than the children of God. And then God’s children will have their impressions of History, Science, Literature, Art, Music and Math molded by those of the secular world. (God isn’t the Lord of all His creation for nothing. God is present in all areas of learning, and we should teach our children accordingly.) The children of God will surely suffer for it.   Well, that wasn’t very brief, but I think that it shows why I believe that, on the whole, putting our Christian children in the public schools will only weaken their light, and will only weaken them in their fulfillment of the Great Commission, rather than the opposite. I will also add that the responsibility to give children an education falls solely on the parents of the children. Therefore if the parents chose to educate their children through the public schools, any mistakes made by the teachers in the public schools fall on the heads of the parents of the children, for they are ultimately responsible.

1531,Gemini,"           I remember a day when they used to deliver the comedy. Much like Chevy Chase and Dan Ackroyd, they've bought into their own ego and have sunk their cred completely. I'm talking about those that now call themselves members of Working Dog Productions. Many a year ago when they were doing the Late Show, each of those kids brought the funny through both writing and performance. Their next gig Frontline was sharp for the most part and worthy. But everything since has been a great deal of ick.  Yet strangely I still watch the Panel weekly. They're pale shadows of their former selves, losing it more each week. It dawned on me earlier this week what symbolises their fall from grace in my eyes.  Jo Stanley.  I have no idea who she is. She seems to be gradually replacing Kate Langbrook of whom knew how to deliver the occasional laugh. But this Jo chick does nothing. She stays silent for the majority of each episode, speaking once or twice with the most uninspired comment she can conceive at the time, then goes back to her solemness. There's so many talented people out there who could be bringing more to the show than she does, yet they've got her on weekly doing nothing. I'm all for developing new talent, but all she's doing is supplying the new. Back when the guys knew comedy, there's no way they'd have her on air each week.  At least Tony Martin and Mick Molloy still seem to know what they're doing. I enjoyed Molloy's directorial debut Crackerjack a heck of a lot. And I have complete faith that Tony Martins debut flick Bad Eggs will be inspired when its released in July.  If only we could find out whatever happened to Jason Stephens.         "

1539,Pisces,"             My former neighbor John Cale has a new EP out called '5 Tracks' which I believe is a precursor to a full length album due out early next year. This is great stuff. Anyone who is interested in something different, interesting and catchy should snag this. He's a tad grumpy in real life (he once almost kung fu kicked Chris Connelly), but he's a fantastic musician, who, like his former bandmate Lou Reed, seems to improve with age (not counting Reed's dumbass Edgar Allan Poe thing). 'FRAGMENTS OF A RAINY SEASON' remains one of my all time favorite CD's. Many moons ago, Chris Link made Dr. Fury and I go see Cale at NYU while he was touring for 'FRAGMENTS' and to say it was one of the best things I ever saw would be selling it way too short. I've seen the man perform dozens of times since and he never ever once failed to be incredible. To my knowledge he hasn't peformed here in NYC for quite some time, but when he comes, it's an absolute must see.  I have asked some of my other MOGpac members to post on this board about their likes/dislikes of all things music/film/books etc, cause honestly, I am bored reading myself. We all have such diverse tastes that I'm sure anyone who reads this as it progresses will wonder how we all haven't killed each other yet.

1540,Cancer,"       'ello. Much has happened since I last posted. I can't remember most of what has happened, and that which I do remember, I shall tell.  On Saturday morning, I went bright and early (10:00 am) to the Junior Bridges meeting, where we did relatively nothing for three hours but repeat our summer experiences indoors. Afterwards, Elise and I joined each other with Whitney A., one of her friends, Laura (companion of Elise), and Nisha at the not-so-nearby McAlister's, and we all had lunch. Elise made me (she really did make me) eat a pickle, and, like I maintain, it was disgusting. I washed it down with cheesecake. Elise hit me several times for being ridiculous. She makes me so very happy.  Then I went home and killed myself with car wax.  That evening, I drove to Alanna's house, for we were planning to see Big Fish. (Brock drove his bloody nice car to her house.) Brock was there, and so was Morgan, and so was Laylee, but Laylee couldn't go to the movie (goddamn regulations). Laylee and Alanna were showering when I arrived, so I watched and listened to Alanna's computer with Brock and Morgan. Alanna asked me to call Brock wordy-durds for her, so I complied: 'YOU FUCKING CUNT! WHY ARE YOU SUCH AN ASSHOLE?' I apologized to Brock.  Big Fish was sold out. We rented A Life Less Ordinary instead, and watched it at Brock's house. Morgan had me scream 'Get your hands off of my woman, muthafucka!' in the car on the way there. And Wesley definately thinks I am not human. So fun.  I wrote this of late, and was encouraged to post it:   Your back is bent against the side of the mattress Head, thrown back to touch the frame And your eyes, closed As the blood rushes to your ears And feeling that peaceful euphoria on ultimate Calm, in one spot One single place in the universe Where everything is correct, for one hour One hand flung carelessly to lay on the floor The fingers slightly curled And the other in my palm, for me to hold As I peer over the mattress edge At your eyelids, and half-open lips Lightly laying one hand on your naked stomach For the sake of feeling flesh And muscle and tissue, pulsing For the sake of inhaling your exhale For the caress against skin, produces a dizzying Carbon-dioxide-inhaling sensation, like I can’t breathe And I drink my own dopamine That tells my body, you are attracted to The body that hangs over the edge of the bed Even if it isn’t for sex or marriage or legality It’s a natural love potion And I want to roll over and sigh Writing on her stomach in Sharpie:  The scents of your natural perfume And my sense of compassion for you When your back is bent And your heart inhaling The quiet lullaby of your breath Weaves the dream over my eyes And allows me to sleep more deeply.

1541,Gemini,"             Do you think that you would SINK or SWIM&nbsp;in a giant pool of JELL-O?  What color do you think the gelatin mass would end up being if you invited people to help fill up this pool?   How many pans of the scrumptious gelatin desert would it take to fill up a normal size backyard swimming pool?&nbsp;   Do you think that someone would donate their pool to the cause?  How much fridge space would it take to hold all this Jell-o?In cubic inches of course?   THE ANSWER WE CAME UP WITH IS, I DON'T KNOW, LETS FIND OUT?  My&nbsp;old roommate&nbsp;and I,&nbsp; were sitting around pondering various theories and philosophies on women one fine Sunday afternoon, when a Jell-o commercial came on featuring a Mom that was having quiet a pool party where this gelatin delight was the featured treat for all the good little boys and girls.&nbsp; Then it hits us, as I see a kid jumping into the pool with his little swimmies on, wouldn't it be awesome if we filled a pool up with Jell-o and went swimming? You know&nbsp;you probably heard someone talking about it at one time or another, usually 4 or 5 in the morning after a good party where all the marathon&nbsp;party goers and sea skimmers are left talking about absolutely intelligent stuff, bad thing is everyone usually forgets all the conversations and the bright ideas&nbsp;after a few hours of sleep.&nbsp; Well anyway when ever a few of us get together and hang out until the crack of dawn we always get to talking about it, now here's our chance.&nbsp; We haven't made and real plans yet but that's what this website is all about.&nbsp; I recently moved to Arizona to check out how people live in the desert, its not to shabby.&nbsp; But out of all the destinations my friends live in I chose here to do this feat.&nbsp; Not only because its close and I wouldn't really have to spend any money to travel (leaves more money for Jell-o), but because the winter is a nice temperature, people would be willing to jump in and it would be cool enough to keep the Jell-o in its prime form, whatever that may be.&nbsp; Anyways I don't know many people out here and the ones a do either don't have pools, aren't willing to donate to the cause or their parents aren't willing to donate to the cause.&nbsp; So I call upon you, anywhere in the country preferably South or Southwest USA, to do your duty to all those crazy thoughts you have had, have now or will have one day, and donate a pool to the cause or submit your name and email to be put on a list to donate your time and effort to making Jell-o to go in this pool whatever size it may be.&nbsp; If I get a good response I will be getting in touch with some of my contacts at the radio stations.&nbsp; Who knows maybe there is a World Record to be made?&nbsp; I just checked on the website and I don't see anything there . . . Is it a sign??&nbsp;   Anyways welcome to my blog, more intelligent ideas to come I am sure . . .            "

1548,Pisces,"             The weather suddenly gets good and things get going here! First off, my laptop is back and to make a long story short, when upgrading to OSX, something went wrong and I wiped out EVERYTHING I have ever done in this laptop. Let's not use words like 'backed up' or 'saved', ok? Needless to say, thanks to the geniuses at DRIVESAVERS, I have all my erased files and I am significantlly lighter in the wallet. However, now my computer is running super amazing out of control awesome. Though I have no music software at the moment.  However, we have some amazing stuff brewing for this new album. Ash's bass playing is incredible on MORNING AFTER and the bridge we wrote for CREATION PHASE was looped over and over again when I spent my Saturday at the studio.  Before all this, Mr. G, Brandt, and I checked out the face in Brooklyn, just a block away from where my mom grew up. This venue, Southpaw, is the bestfor Saintface.They thrive there. Memo to the guitar player: Dont punch your guitar after the first song unless you have a backup guitar, pally. Just sayin.  Morrissey has often failed me in his solo life. I have yet to enjoy myself at any of his solo gigs that I have been to. His last album was utter shit. Saintface, who I have described as 'what Morrissey wishes his solo career was' has my heart in recent years when it comes to music. However, he is always forgiven. I will buy his new album and already spent way too much money on tickets for his gig next month. I have to admit, I'm enjoying the Morrissey comeback. We live in an age where we DO need someone like Morrissey to be, ahem, our frank role model. Reading his intelligent and witty criticisms of our world in the NME this weekend made me smile. However, the SPIN article was terrible. Not because of him, but because SPIN is the worst music magazine pretending to be cool I have ever read. Put Peter Saintface on the cover and maybe I'll by it again.  I think the first photo session for HF2 is this week. Maybe Thursday. I'll keep you posted.  F           "

1550,Taurus,"   This is my first entry. I have long wanted to a place write down my thoughts but have never gone through with the process. Today I saw an article on Yahoo that talked about this web site and decided this would suit my needs just fine.  Today is my last Monday working for this company. I am a production planner. The company is closing operations in Mexico and our office, located in San Antonio, is no longer needed. I have worked for this company for twelve years, initially in Laredo Texas, and, for the last 10 years in San Antonio.  Losing my job has me filled with anxiety. I have two children, a nine year old son and a seventeen year old daughter. Although my wife has a good job, I am unsure of what our future will be. My daughter will be a senior in high school next year and will go to college the year after. How we'll pay for that I do not know.  My dad worked as a lithographer and lost his job when I was the same age my daughter is now. We moved to a little town in Illinois where I finished school. My senior year of high school was six weeks long. I had enough accumulated credit from the district I was in to graduate in Illinois and only had to wait through a probationary period to receive a degree. Knowing money was tight, I never asked about going to college but rather started working. My first job was with a company in Merriam Kansas near where I grew up. Finding myself in the same position now as dad was then is really scary. We kids never knew how difficult it was for him.  On one hand I am sure all will turn out well and on the other I am consumed with guilt for failing my family. I worry about how we will survive financially and how we will give to our children the things we want to give them. I look at mom and dad today and see two people that have survived the years still waking each day happy and with a bright outlook. I know, I hope, I will be the same when I am their age.  One of my brothers is currently searching for a job and it worries mom and dad so much I am reluctant to tell them about me. I feel so alone not sharing this but don't want to add the stress to their lives. They will probably be upset when they do learn of this but I'll accept that when it comes.  Luckily, the company is giving me a generous severance package which will keep us afloat until Christmas. I have started searching for jobs here in San Antonio. I will probably have to take a job outside my experience at much less money. Finding work would be easier if I looked outside the city, or better, outside the state. I won't do that as I have promised my daughter I would not move the family before she graduated from high school.    "

1552,Gemini,           I had a GREAT time yesterday.  ♥          
1553,Sagittarius,"       Apparently, and unfortunately, I am not the only one receiving incensed messages from people with more passion than enlighted knowledge.   urlLink Astrology - Horoscopes - Jonathan Cainer's Zodiac Forecasts   And thank you readers for your comments.  I feel better already!   Diva out.         "
1554,Taurus,"           So, I have to admit, I went to this thing not expecting much more than a 1) stay off it, 2) ice it and 3) come back in a week so I can charge your insurance another $200.  Let's just say I was pleasantly surprised.  First off, the guy who 'runs the show' is an avid cyclist (like myself), a surfer, an MTB racer and many other things that I'm also into.  So, he's cool shit.  On top of that, he's also a very nice guy.  That would have been enough to keep me satisfied, but no, he had the obligatory really really really cute girl working at the front desk.  In any case, I'm sittin there chatting about how the injury occurred (my stupid ass pushing myself too hard - as usual), and he was having me walk around, probing the achilles and other shit.  He sets me down to give me some ultrasound with some special anti-inflammatory gel.  He looks at me, see's me checkin front desk girl out, and mentions, 'Hey, why don't you come back here and help out Mr. Murphy with his ultrasound'.  WOOHOO!   The 'cool' factor of this guy just went up 10-fold.  Hah.  She comes over, starts preppin me, and we're just chattin away.  Found out some fun stuff, but stupid me, I forgot to look for a friggin ring.  Gahd-damn.    In any case, real nice girl, real pretty and seemed pretty damn cool.  Gotta make it a point to try and get her # next time I head back there.  I'm usually shy about shit like that, but I gotta get over my stupidity at some point, right?  Net net net, I'm catching the tendonitis at a very early stage, it hasn't yet traveled up the achilles itself, which would be a *very* bad thing (entailing surgery).  Doc's got me on Vioxx, apparently some heavy anti-inflammatory prescription stuff.  Stretch twice a day, ice twice a day, go easy on the tendon, I guess I can get some easy biking in (but no hills).  I should be good to go in a couple weeks if I want to baby it.    I'll keep you schmoes posted.  Oh yeah, and keep your eyes posted tomorrow for a post on african ants.  I saw a show tonight on these things that blew.my.mind.  Heh.         "

1556,Virgo,"           Holy Moly! There is one thing in this world I will never fathom: the consistent sketchy behaviour of some people. And they are consistent, in their sketchiness. Now with sketchy, I'm not talking about the drug induced sketch of today, I'm talking the old school definition: adj. one who is routinely late, and usually coupled with being unreliable. Yes. Well, much of my friendbase consists of these such people.   There's Damian. Damian's wicked. I love Damian. What Damian does is promise you the world, but in the end he backs out, or changes plans without consulting you and you're left potentially with packed bags anticipating a cottage weekend, mentally preparing yourself for bug bites aplenty, but the phone doesn't ring. You try to call him and the phone doesn't answer. Damian is so sketchy that you can't even leave a message on his phone because his mailbox is constantly full of people in exactly the same situation I am. He makes up for it, though. He's always very, very sorry. But mostly he's disarmingly charming and eventually I did end up going to said cottage and having a wonderful time with him and other friends.   Then there's Jeremy. Jesus Christ. He has this affliction, not unlike Leonard Shelby's, from the movie Momento. He has little to no short term memory. It's fascinating and it's irritating both at the same time. For example we'd made tentative, unconfirmed plans to see a baseball game. Things were fine. We'd been chatting throughout the week via email. Nice, nice, nice. Then at one point I'd asked him how his Friday was looking. He said he had these tickets to go see a baseball game. No mention of going with me, just that he had these tickets.... Yeah. It's impossible to make plans with him mostly because there's no real way of knowing if he's going to remember he'd just made plans with you. It's wild, really. He's really bright, but there are moments that I think, 'Jesus, he can't be that stupid.' So, I'm now the stupid one because *again* I've made plans with him and he's completely sketched out again. He called today around lunchtime. Chat, chat, chat. Fine. We make loose plans for tonight. He called firming them up. Said I'd receive a call by 5:00. It's now almost 8:00. Yeah.   Okay, well he just called and he's not a totally unsensitive jerk-wad. He was out with a female friend/ co-worker and she had just told him the most heinous, horrific tale of her marital predicament. It turned out that he'd also received a package from his lawyer outlining his divorce proceedings. So he and his friend had much to comiserate. He had just lost track of the time. It happens. Not to me, but it happens. When he did call he sounded totally shaken up, mostly from the tale told to him by this young woman. I'll never know this story, which is just fine. I'm glad that he was a friend to her, in this world of not-too-friendly people sometimes. And this is why I can still be friends with Jeremy and forgive him his own very unique brand of sketchy behaviour. If we can't understand and then forgive our friends their foibles and inconsistencies then what kind of friend would we be? Not so good.            "

1560,Taurus,"        The planes at the airport aren't the only thing flying about these days. Yep, you guessed it. Rumors. I'm getting tired of what everyone is saying about the Public Safety Program coming to a close shortly, but the more I hear the more I seem to believe that there may be some truths to these tales.  They've been doing a lot of remodeling lately, security wise at Indianapolis International. They've installed truck-traps and new permanent type shacks that with government funding is costing over 500k per. But here's the kicker....Just recently I spoke with one of the contractors and he said that they are designing them now where they can be unmanned. UNMANNED! WTF!!! What was the sense of putting the Shitter-The AC and The Heaters&nbsp;in each one of those shacks.  Also the vehicles that were bought for us to get out to some of these shacks that lay on the tug roads next to the taxi-ways and runways, will be taken away soon..The Ford Expedition is going to one of our K-9 units and the Escape is going to either the Fire Dept. or Another one of the K-9's.. either way all the tell tale signs are there...I think we're doomed. It'll be unemployment city soon for me if these rumors are right. I cant see how they cant be right.  This guy that is Vice President of Customer Service, just recently came to Indy from Britain and right away he started talking about the PSO's being more customer friendly and that we the pso's were going to be part of 'Customer Service'&nbsp; even talk of new uniforms, not those ratty old navy blue bdu's ..we were going to move up in the world and wear khaki pants with some sort of shirt...whether it be a polo type or a sleeved shirt, not sure yet..but that's under scrutiny. Can you imagine having to climb up into a truck to search the inside wearing khaki pants?!?!  The next thing we know the Director of Public Safety gets up and hands in his resignation (no big loss there, the guy was a loser)  Anyway, it's been 3 weeks since this new head honcho shows up and he hasn't even made an attempt to get to know any of us. Today was actually the first day he came to roll call and introduced himself to us and that's only because the other day we had a UPS delivery man come to the airport and on his way inside the building his heart decided to give out..Who was the first uniformed officer on the scene???? A PSO! (public safety officer) The police showed up a few moments later with an AED (automatic electronic defibulator) The first two officers to start CPR were pso's recalling their training. Unfortunately though, even after everyone showed up, medics,police etc. the gentleman still expired. It was not a good day to say the least, however in some selfish reasoning..it was a good day for the pso's.&nbsp; So this guys introduction was a ploy for the Chief of Police to hand out certificates of recognition to those officers that responded to that situation. Our&nbsp;condolences do go out to the mans' family.  My point is, The Public Safety Officers aren't only the customers first point of contact but also the first impression...I know there are some officers that could use some classes on kindness, but the airport also needs to take into consideration that we were hired also as security and were trained accordingly. But it appears that Security has relaxed way too much at Indy International, and not by our doing. I've been with Public Safety now for a little over 2 years and LOVED my job until just recently..Now with all the restrictions they have placed on us..and thats another blog...believe me.... I just dont enjoy my job anymore. I'm definately experiencing&nbsp;the Security Blues.  Until Next Time..We'll be seeing you and remember if your party isn't on the curb ready to load just park the car and go inside and get them, because all we're going to do is have you paged back to your vehicle.  Boy, I miss the days when Indy's Finest Showed up with the flashing yellows and it costed you over a hundred bucks and a release form to get your car out of impound for an Unattended Vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;          "
1561,Aquarius,"             In the past, employees have been permitted to make trips to the restroom under informal guidelines. Effective August 2004, a Restroom Trip Policy will be established to provide a more consistent method of accounting for each employee's restroom time and ensuring equal treatment of employees. Under the policy, a 'Restroom Trip Bank' will be established for each employee. The first day of each month, employees will be given a Restroom Trip credit of twenty (20) trips. Restroom Trip credits can be accumulated from month to month. Within two weeks, the entrances to all restrooms will be equipped with personnel identification stations and computer linked voice print recognition devices. Before the end of December, each employee must provide two copies of voice-prints (one normal and one under stress) to the material department. The voice print recognition stations will be operational but not restrictive for the month of August. Employees should acquaint themselves with the station during that period.If the employee's Restroom Bank balance reaches zero, the doors to the restroom will not unlock for that employee's voice until the first of the next month. In addition, all restroom stalls are being equipped with timed paper toll retractors. If the stall is occupied for more than three minutes, an alarm will sound. Thirty seconds after the alarm sounds the roll of paper will retract into the wall, the toilet will flush, and the stall door will open. If the stall remains occupied, your picture will be taken. The picture will then be posted on the Distribution Centre Bulletin Boards. Anyone's picture showing up three (3) times will be immediately terminated. If you have any questions about this policy, please ask your immediate supervisor. They have all received advance instruction. Thank you and have a nice daySource: The Himalayan Times - Jul 18, 2004         "

1563,Taurus,"           The Achilles has been feelin alright for about the last week (better and better every day).  THEN I went on a site inspection today up in Torrance - no big deal, just had to *walk* about 25 units, shouldn't have been a problem.  Well, I don't know how I did it, but somehow I pissed off my achilles BAD walking to the *first* unit.  The next two hours were spent cruising up and down flights of stairs and running all over this 10 acre property - all in all must've been about 3 miles, on the messed up leg.  Oof.  Went to the PT guy tonight, got my shit checked out - the tendon was all inflamed, so he stretched it out some, some more ultrasound, some more stretching, some ice, and a SICK tape job.  I feel great again!  Woo hoo!  I've got 2 appts scheduled for next week.  In any case, now, getting to what you've all been reading for: the 'front desk chick'.  As I mentioned in my  urlLink previous post , I was gonna make a conscious effort to check the left hand ring-finger to see if it was cool to chat her up.  Well, lets just say I found this ' urlLink true-to-scale ' picture.    Bling.   DISCLAIMER :  From here on in, this post gets serious, and rather grumpy.  Thanks for the reminder (and the KICK ASS! 'title pic'  urlLink Chad !)  So, honestly, why the fuck do girls always want to get married so fuckin early?  I hear the whole ' urlLink biological clock ' argument, but WTF.  Maybe I'm just immature, but shit, I'm 25 and though I've come a *long* way since 18 in terms of relationships, however I  still  can't see my lame ass getting married within the next 10 years.  I got too much shit to do!  Between starting my  urlLink real-estate empire , living in  urlLink NorCal  at some point, living in  urlLink NYC  at some point, living in  urlLink TX  at some point (don't ask), and spending some *serious* time in  urlLink Alaska , who the fuck is gonna wanna follow my fat ass around?  B/c God knows I don't see myself compromising any of my life aspirations for anyone at this point (and maybe that's the problem, eh?).  Though it's nice to be 'unencumbered' at times, at other times it sucks some pretty fat,  urlLink hemherroid-ridden ass .  I mean, I *DO* actually have a good time going camping in  urlLink Yosemite  by myself (for example) - which absolutely horrifies some people.  Alternatively, stick me in the corner with a  urlLink book  and I can bop till I drop.  At other times, all I want is someone to share things with - whether it be feelings, experiences, joy, pain, whatever - it's the act of sharing that's important, it's the catharsis.  I guess I want someone to care and listen, but I don't want to be beholden - is that an  urlLink oxymoron ?   As much as I say I have that with my friends, I do and I don't.  Does anyone else ever wonder what your 'friends' would think of you if they didn't get the 'watered-down' version?  I do, and I withdraw b/c most people can barely handle 'fat kid light' - so I make the compromise to have some semblance of companionship - but how real is it, who am I fooling, and WHY?!?  How shitty, huh.  That was a rhetorical question.  :b  In any case, I don't know why I went off on that tangent.  I must sound like a little bitch, but damn it all if shit doesn't build up in every one of us - I guess it just takes me longer to 'let it out', as it goes.  'The little one' would probably laugh that I have to vent to the internet.  QED I guess, hah.           "

1574,Gemini,"           Last week my Uncle had a minor accident. While traveling along a busy narrow street, his truck mirror clipped the mirror of a van parked along the curb. He couldn’t stop right away because of the location and the amount of traffic, so he went to the end of the street, turned around and went back. When he arrived, the van was gone. (Apparently it was someone stopped at a yard sale.)  Not wanting to let this go, he went to the Police Station and told the clerk what had happened. They said they did get a report of the incident and the investigating officer was called in to interview my Uncle. During the interview, the officer said they had several ‘eyewitnesses’ willing to testify. Depending on which report he read, they either swore that the alleged hit and run driver was driving a red or green truck. Once he heard this, my Uncle took the officer outside and showed him his  white  truck. All white with some thin black body molding on the sides. The officer told him that they had actually seen him coming back up the street, but they never would have stopped him. They were looking for a green or red truck. So my Uncle told him that he must be innocent since he drove a white truck (He has since paid for repairs to the mirror, by the way.)  My question here is this, how can we rely on eyewitness accounts when something like this can happen? The traveling speed on the street in question can’t be more than 15 mph. It is too narrow and the traffic was too heavy. The witnesses swearing to the color might even have been able to run alongside and gotten a license plate number. But the ‘sworn reports’ were so far off that the police could drive right by the person they were looking for and never know it.  This incident is a minor one. What about major ones where people ‘swear they saw everything?’ Minor story, but kind of scary to me.          "

Just watched the movie Super Size Me, if you haven't heard about it, it is about an american man, only living from food from McDonalds in 30 days, yeah... one month that is. This movie, or documentary as you might call it, is far beyond informative, I really found it interesting watching it.  Here are some facts about the american way of living:  -  Each day, 1 in 4 Americans visits a fast food restaurant  -  In 1972, we spent 3 billion a year on fast food - today we spend more than 110 billion  -  McDonald's feeds more than 46 million people a day more than the entire population of Spain  -  French fries are the most eaten vegetable in America  -  You would have to walk for seven hours straight to burn off a Super Sized Coke, fry and Big Mac  -  In the U.S., we eat more than 1,000,000 animals an hour  -  60 % of all Americans are either overweight or obese  -  One in every three children born in the year 2000 will develop diabetes in their lifetime  -  Left unabated, obesity will surpass smoking as the leading cause of preventable death in America  -  Obesity has been linked to: Hypertension, Coronary Heart Disease, Adult Onset Diabetes, Stroke, Gall Bladder Disease.....  [ Lend from supersizeme.com where you can read the rest of these facts ]  I myself is one of those people who could possibly have been in this movie, I don't eat fast food often, but I sure like it, at the moment I am on a diet arranged by my mother mainly, and untill now, I have already lost 6 Kg's (~13 pounds), in a little more than a month... And I personally and mentally feel so much better from it.  So well, back to the movie... This guy, Morgan Spurlock, gains more than 20 pounds during these 30 days, he gets sick, and whatmore... This is for sure a movie worth watching, and I am sure it will change your view on fast food how we see it today!         "

1581,Libra,"                 Today SUCKS!!!    And it's only 9, I can't wait to see what happens later.    1) I forgot my phone so the only way I have music to listen to is if I go outside to get my CDs out of my car.    2) I got a ticket this morning, 44 in a 25 (School Zone).  Fuck that, I swear I was going 35, I was still in 3rd gear.  I'm going to do some internet research into the efficacy of Laser in adverse conditions.    3) I haven't heard back from the Dentist Bitch (I'm sure she's perfectly nice).    4) I may or may not be allergic to some of the skin care products I've been using; I can't stop sneezing.    5) I can't think of number 5.    6) I'm going to Jender's tonight, and without a phone have no way of letting her know what to order from Red Pepper (If you're reading this just pick something that we wrote 'good' next to)    7) Dave Thomas, Wendy's founder and friend to all grease lovers, died.    So Have a Fucking Good Day!  I know I won't.    PS. Hey I think I may have come up with some sort of general idea for a script, but I have to flush it out in order to see if it would make a good flick.

1582,Libra,"       Yep, thats right, I'm invited back!! Yahoo!! I have to go back on tuesday, and do a presentation to the line managers. Here's the paragraph from the email:   Congratulations you have been successful in moving through to the second round of the Masterfoods Australia/NZ Graduate Recruitment process, which will be held on the week commencing Monday 10th of May.   We will require three hours of your time, on the day highlighted below.  In the first two hours you will prepare a case study to present to Masterfoods Line Managers, followed by a half hour presentation of this case study.  Finally we will require you for an interview to commence immediately after the conclusion of your presentation.   Its a bit daunting! But so exciting! I'm ready!!   In other news, nothing much else is happening, except that I clumsily sprained my ankle whilst coming home from the station.. I had plannned to go to Bowral to see school friends but that came to an end. Tonight is Allys Bday party, i didn't know what to get her (the girls all went in and got her something already, didn't even ask me) so I just got her this hand cream set with little gloves. I think its so cute but i don't know, if she doesn't like it i guess I'll give her the receipt so she can change it... i am over caring what anyone thinks, if they are getting a present from me, they'd better just like it.   I think i'm good at presents, unlike some ppl (one yr the girls went in and got me a picnic basket - i already had one so now i have two cause i didn't want to rude and say anything)......and last yr i asked for cds and a toiletry bag for my upcoming trip and i got this white make up boxy thing which isn't really what i meant (and now lives underneath my bathroom sink in the cupboard as a general stoage thing), so i am going to have to be specific this year indeed...   Sigh.. Dave's bday is coming up and I have no idea what to get him. He is so hard to buy for! Particularly cause I think i am running out of ideas... He needs alot of things for his apt, like towels and a broom but i think getting those might be boring.  Hahah speaking of boring I asked him if he wanted concert tickets to the John Butler Trio and he said he'd like towels... so I guess towels it is then.. and I might take him for a nice meal... he loves king st wharf, as I do, his work always has these social club (yes he's in the social club) dos and the last one he raved on and on about!!! But i'm glad that he's enjoying his work!  Well, better go do some Uni work.. thats right I still have uni work...   BYE!!                 "

1584,Capricorn,"       Much to YingKs! disappointment, I have decided to for-go my initial plan of continuing my ramblings with 'Lowly Situations 2', but instead write on my earliest memories....  Have you earhtlings out there wondered why we can only remember things that don't strecth far back from the day we were born but instead only start at maybe 3 to 4 years of age. Surely, a memory as horrenduous as coming out from dear mommy's womb is not something very attractive. However, why is it that our brains are rewired intentially?  I was reduced to conversing with myself the other day, thanks to boredom, my very,very close companion.I started thinking about what I could remember from my days as a very little child. Somehow, I could only make out three, vaguely that is. I simply concluded these golden three were my earliest because I couldn't precisely make out my age from them and because they were as brief as a bolt of lightning. I have chosen to speak of only one though.  I woke up on a misty morning still shy of the sun. The windows were still dark in my grandmother's house and I was blinking repeatedly to get the blotchy feeling out of my eyes. I rubbed my them rather vigorously and heard the birds early morning chatter on the world news. My grandmother's powder room had the lights on, a clear indication that she was up and about. I reluctantly flipped my blanket and was welcomed by the cold breeze of the fan. Standing up, I dizzily walked to the kitchen knowing without a thought that she would be there.  I saw her, standing near the sink. She was peeling something or another and I went closer with the intention to help. Odd = somehow as a child we accept our roles outlined by the respective gender more readily than when we are adults. She handed me the white miniature pumpkin with a severe case of dry skin but refused to give me the small knife. She then briefly disappeared.   I heard the screeching of a chair being lifted up far off and then put down again very close to me. With one mighthy movement, I was carried and I soon found myself on a raised platform. Previously, without the chair, I could only reach the sink if I was standing on my toes.  Within a few minutes, I was dismissed. My little fingers couldn't compensate for the speed she wanted to work with..  That's all...unfortunately. I wish I could remember more on the time when I was a little child under the watchful eye of my grandmother. Those days when life was so simple should have lasted longer and cherished.   Having accounted mine, what's yours?         "
1585,Sagittarius,"       I awoke this morning in a foul mood.  Why??  I don't really know.  I had become a little testy on the phone with my girlfriend last night but not enough to justify it carrying over to the next day.  One thing I do know is it is setting the precedence for the rest of the day, which isn't really surprising as once I get in a foul mood it is extremely hard to pull myself up out of the trenches of self loathing and hatred.  I've been at work for the last 4 hours and have thus far accomplished nothing, at least a lot more nothing then what I usually accomplish while at work.  In recent times I have slipped from a model employee to the try to do as little as possible disgruntle employee, reason being my boss recently hired a new employee and our office is turning into a good ole boys club where I being of the opposite sex feel out of place.  I work at a university and have worked in the same department for the past four years, my official job title is Computer Support Assistant yet my responsibilities have grown much since I started gainful employment here.  Yet now I’m feeling under appreciated as the new guy is getting paid more than me and is perhaps destined, in the near future, for a pay rise, just to stick the knife in a little deeper.    You could argue that his job title carries more clout then mine as he is officially known as a Web Developer, yet I as a lowly old Computer Support Assistant should technically be paid less, yet it appears that I have moved from the illustrious realm of shit kicker to web developer over the years, yet I still kick the shit when ever someone is in.  Technically we should be on an equal playing field, yet this too doesn’t seem to be the case.  Because I have been here the longest I am given the added responsibility of maintaining our servers while my boss lays on a beach somewhere smelling of coconut oil and slowly burning flesh.   But alas it is not to be, I must suffer in silence, I know I’ve not been very silent.  I do however feel much better now after this little venture, perhaps my foul mood was simply due to pent up frustrations which have since subsided as a result of this writing.  I feel better now and perhaps well enough to do some real work.          "

1592,Pisces,"        - what happened yesterday -    So much happened yesterday.  If I wax essayistic about each *thing*, I could write an alternate universe.    So I'll try adapting the idiom of the internet -- brevity.  Ang & Ryan moved.  (after a long battle with U-Haul clerks who were annoyingly friendly)  Mark & Toby successfully installed the upstairs toilet! (no more midnight treks down two flights of stairs!)  Jeff, with my cowardly help, transported a SKUNK in our mini van from Marcia's back yard (it had lived under her house) to the local park / frisbee golf course. (Wives & Kids cheered as 'Sonja' ambled through the grass to her new life.)  A woman in A & R's church told them, just before they went to sleep Saturday Night that a woman SHOT herself in their bedroom.  Where they have lived for the last year.    And though Ang didn't say this -- I'm pretty sure that this is a secret that their whole church has been keeping from them.  (The house they lived in is the 'youth pastor house' for a string of youth pastors.)  Of course my interest in the story is primarily Proprietary --   PITCH: young couple moves from house where ghost has lived unbeknownst to them.  Ghost liked their life so much that she moved WITH them -- but started to act up once she was in a new * place *.

1594,Pisces,"       i mean that title NOT in the way you first read it.   there's been a horrific shift in the american political landscape which conflates:   celebrity culture *&* infotainment *&* religious discourse   and now people say things (regularly) like:   but, how you know that he (X politician -- fill in the blank) is _a good christian_.  OR  at least you always know _where he stands on things_.  He takes one position and always sticks to it.  OR  its our duty to support _men of god_ in their political office.  I understand that in the post-clinton / monica-gate / it depends on the what the meaning of is *is*...  that the idea of a SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD LEADER seems like a good solution to the danger of legalese shiftyness.  but this morning, while reading the news, I bumped into  urlLink this story about the 'godly' John Ashcroft  whose minions have been working night and day to carefully parse the meaning of  SEVERE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERING -- words which constrain the define the borderland between torture and coercion within the US consititution....  Of course this stuff probably won't get airtime or real play in the mainstream newsmedia -- but the reality is that politics and government and legislative demand an ability to live in the murky realms of grey which define the ugly land of legalese...  why won't the evangelicals pass around excerpts from this memo on email linked up to what a faithful upstanding member of his congregation Ashcroft is?   ...  and the problem with voting for George Bush because he's a simple, straighforward fellow is this:    he *is* responsible for all of the specific policy decisions that have been made on his watch by his people.   Cheney's Halliburton fiasco -- is PART of G.W.'s moral character.  Ashcroft's careful legal defense for the untenable torture/coercion at various sites in the U.S. occupation --- IS part of of GW's moral character.   The new US foreign policy of unilateral engagement based on the simple (and wrongheaded) suspicion of WMD  -- is part of GW's moral character.   that is -- if moral character is why we vote on presidents or politicians -- I'd much rather vote on their policies and their appointments.      "
1595,Gemini,"       Opportunity, is it always present or is it once in a blue moon?  When is it best to go after opportunity and when is it not?  These are questions that I'm currently asking myself.  I believe I'm a natural born opportunist rooted in wisdom and realism.    The question that I'm asking is,  can it be wrong to pass on opportunity when you feel and believe it may not be the right time?   Actually, opportunity from what I've gathered is when luck and preparation meet.  I feel somewhat lucky that I was approved for a home loan for the price range that I wanted.  However, I just don't think I have everything in order.  For example, I need to increase my monthly income and reduce my current debt to feel comfortable enough to commit myself to a mortgage payment.  Then if I say no, I don't want to disappoint my family.  So what should I do?  Well opportunity should put you on the path of progression rather than regression.  The path that you choose to walk down will determine whether or not you'll pursue certain opportunities.  I am not a pessimist, but I'm just cautious and I like to operate within reality.  Reality dictates that if I commit to this mortgage, there really won't be any wiggle room or margin for error.  Also, we have a baby on the way and that in itself is going to increase our monthly expenditures.  I guess to summarize, my response is the same that I give when people ask me how did I know my wife was the one?   When you know, you just know.   The fact that you have doubts or unanswered questions, should be the red flags.  There's no philosophical explanation, no magic formula or anything.  When that opportunity is for you, a sense of confidence and peace enshrouds you.   The bottom line is that it's okay to say no to some opportunities, especially if it is not time or it was not intended for you.          "

1598,Pisces,"       - rededication to blogging - going meta - travel anecdotes - are people MADE for something -   Just returned from long weekend in Michigan with family and am now committed to going public with this blog (thanks, Marcaus, for the prompting...).  Please pardon the 'dust', all, because its going to be a work in progress shaping the right links and figuring out what i should and shouldn't say here.  Blogs seem to me to be sort of an odd (con)fusion of private and public kinds of disclosure.   I realize that I have a painful tendency to go 'meta' when i'm writing in this venue.  I tend to constantly wrap layers and layers of commentary around everything I'm saying.  I'm sure this is a cultural symptom of something, but I'm not sure what.   So the weekend away was great.  Lynn and I have a great tradition of unravelling the experiences of the trip as we ride home together.  J & A are at the age where they are able to entertain themselves and each other for long enough gaps that we're just starting to have those conversations again.  I must digress for a moment here.  We were pulling out of one of the new 80-90 rest-areas-that-look-like-churches-or-malls-or museums last night and the light was on and Lynn was standing on and over her seat helping the kids settle into the 'beds' that we made for them and we passed a cop.  He backed out of the median and started following us.  We weren't speeding at all, so we're pretty sure that he started following us for Lynn's illegal stand-and-turn.  If only he could have seen HOW illegal we were with the kids makeshift beds all sprawled everywhere.  Someone needs to make a laying down seatbelt for kids and long trips.  Is there such a thing?   So it turns out that not only do i go meta a lot -- I also digress a lot.  But if you know me in person, you already knew that...  My favorite times were a family history video session with my grandparents and my dad, a long chat by the pool with my dad & throwing the toddlers around int the pool with my brothers.    The *delight* that they had: splashing, jumping, getting thrown, climbing up the backs and shoulders of uncles: it all seemed so core: as pure as I imagine Plato's idea of the forms to be:  something sacred and divine.   I really had a good time smashing together the 30 minute honorific dramatic presentation of my Grandfather's life story.  My aunt Nan had written down all the great stories and structured them in four acts.  It was up to us to make them theatrical.  My sisters in law (and Ryan) have low tolerance levels for Rudd - Theatrical - Performative- Production - Projects.  And the show was bumpy -- but a crowdpleaser none the less.  from script to stage in 5 hours.   It reaffirmed all of me that IS  urlLink Max Fisher .  Have you NOT seen that movie yet? (DAVID!) Max explains so much of me.   My back burner question for the day is this:  are we made for something?  And I don't mean are we ALL made for something -- because I know what our chief end is -- and I affirm it.  What I mean is -- are we made to DO something?  Are we -- as individuals?  I'm lamenting / considering / reflecting on my profession and it seems so wrapped up in this question of -- but am I doing the BEST thing?  Is this the RIGHTEST that I can get it?    This year the water at our cottage was Incredibly Low this year.  So low, in fact that, for the first time in my life, I found the Fresh (very cold) water springs that feed the lake near the shore (well -- they were kinda ON the shore at low tide this year).  The experience seemed seminal (did you hear that Kristy? Jared? ) and deep (not literal).  These springs were so -- i know its corny, but -- inspiring!  They were just these ridiculous little bubbles of water -- that looked like a broken drinking fountain -- no bigger (until you stepped into them).  But you look up and there's a LAKE in front of you. A BIG lake.  A lake that is connected to Lake Huron -- which is also just fed by these little miniscule -- ridiculously poignant bubbles.   And so I journalled:   I was thinking that every person must have SPRINGS inside of them.  That some things must feed  us just because that’s where they are in our souls.  Aren’t there some currents some bubbles in us that are OURS only and not  simply products of the world out of which we were borne?  Some desires that we have, some gifs that we offer that don’t come only from the people who shaped us and the places where we’ve been?  Shapes that are somehow essentially ours?   But I'm not sure of it -- and i have lots more to say, but I have to off-to-marcs to stock up on Diet Coke (5 cases for 10 dollars).  And I KNOW that I shouldn't like Coke.  Jakki did a speech all last year about aspartame (which is just in diet) and J. Baker had  urlLink THIS  on his site today.

1599,Scorpio,"             I have something called an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder when it comes to turning off the lights. My mother always gets pissed at my living in darkness, and she always says something about darkness making her depressed. As if she needs anything at all to make herself depressed... But anyway my thinking today revealed to me why I always had these vampire like instincts, living in the dark and at one point biting others.  You see I've always wanted to die, like in my previous post. Just get myself away from this horrid and cruel world. But then, after I pass from this world, where will I go? In the Bible, we will supposedly go to heaven, a place of joy. We will be there for the rest of time. Just imagine yourself feeling nothing but happiness forever. Knowing that this will never end. Looking at it like that Heaven may not be too desirable after all. And I won't even need to talk about hell.  Now for the vampire part. You see vampires will never leave this world. They just live and live and continue living on in this world. The only difference from heaven is that these vampires live in a changing world. A world with emotion other than joy. A world that is free for you to explore. A world that you know, and if you don't, will grow to know. Vampires live in a world where they are free to do whatever they want, without facing consequences. Of course there's the downside of having to take lives.  By belief, vampires are servants of Satan.

(for all those who don't know, the house I rent is owned by the owner of an old folk's lodge, and they've retained the use of the basement for their offices.&nbsp; therefor, we have people from the lodge going in and out of our house all the time, driving our dogs crazy.&nbsp; sometimes I just bring them in the house for a little, which is actually against the terms of our lease, rather than listening to them bitch).&nbsp;  OMG!&nbsp; my family is wonderful!&nbsp; they brought me home an iced cappaccino! so, Brad now has a blog!&nbsp; lovely!&nbsp; now I can delve into the innermost thoughts of another person, who's motivations, and interests have previously eluded me!&nbsp;  um...anyways.&nbsp; I'm going to invite Brad to do things with the Collective (oh!&nbsp; did I tell you?&nbsp; Gareth is now a part of the Collective!&nbsp; we have assimilated him!) this coming year.&nbsp; Cause Kevin, his best friend, is leaving for Taiwan soon, so he'll be semi-at ends with his time.&nbsp; I should definitely invite him to hang w/ the Collective more often.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; maybe we could even assimilate him by the end of Grade Twelve?&nbsp; I would like that.&nbsp; I've always admired Brad for his talents and affability. k, one of Sherayna's friends is scoping me out to sing some of his songs.&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; Depends on if his stuff is any good or not.&nbsp; apparenty he's just looking to sell some of his songs, and get songwriting credits.&nbsp; No good.&nbsp; He doesn't have a band, and I doubt what he writes is arrangable.&nbsp; I don't even know if he's even ever written a vocal arrangement, and if you're not familiar with them, you tend not to write very good ones.&nbsp; Hell, I'm familiar with them, and I can't arrange very well at all! huh.&nbsp; I thought I had something to say in this entry, but I guess not.&nbsp; w/e. oh, yeah.&nbsp; I went over to Geoff's last night, and he totally ditched me for Erin and Alex!&nbsp; they went downtown to play some pool, and left me sitting on an uncomfortable bus stop bench for an hour waiting for the last bus of the day!&nbsp; and the infuriatingly ironic part about it was they were headed to a place that's about five minutes away from my house!!!! but Alex couldn't drive me cause of the new one passenger law.&nbsp; shitty deal. in other news, I'm so jazzed!&nbsp; I have readers!&nbsp; from Georgia no less!&nbsp; woo-freakin-hoo!&nbsp; ok, enough with the random enthusiasm.&nbsp; but I was excited.&nbsp; Maybe, given some of the personaly nature of this stuff I shouldn't really be excited that people I don't know are reading this (*blush*), but w/e.&nbsp; I'm a shameless exhibitionist.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deal with it.&nbsp; :)       "
1601,Gemini,"       Today is the first time i brought my little darling Bubs to the park. I don't know why as i was walking towards the park, i guess i was more excited and nervous than Bubbles. Im not sure how my baby is going to react to the rest of the dogs and having an extremely cute and sweet face she is probably gonna attract alot of male dogs. As i expected, this dog (not sure whats the breed) by the name of Oscar felt in love with Bubs. Its definitely love at first sight for him. He charged towards my baby as we were approaching the park and started playing with her. Oscar really adores Bubs, he followed her everywhere in the park. Everyone in the park started giving her attention and think she is super duper cute. Being her mummy, i was so proud of her. Bubbles has brought a bundle of joy into my life suddenly and i never regretted buying her. When i first got her i was very apprehensive because she is my first dog, first pet and frends didn't have confident in me. But i decided to go for it. Bubs indeed has been a challenge. She also kind of a change my life as well. I so so look forward to come home,hug and kiss her. No matter how busy, moody, shitty or tired my day is, i want to give her 15 mins of my time. She brought the maternal instinct out of me,and i came to understand why all mothers will love their kids no matter how naughty, spoilt or rebellious they are and you will always want the best for them. The irony of it all is, in the mist of teaching her things i learn things from her as well. She taught me alot of patient (something i think im never good at) and she also taught me the big word RESPONSIBILITY. I thank God for her everyday and i also thank God im a much happier person now. This year has not been very good for me. I came back to Melbourne with this emptiness and wallow alot in self pity about things. I kept searching for answers for many things in life. My christian's path is often very rough, thorns and briars grow on either side,  theres like a dark cloud hang over it, and no cheering prospects appear to animate my heart. Sometimes i asked myself are trials really a mercies in diguise? But no matter what, i finally realise i have to learn to trusts in an immutable God. Theres this very special Sunday, that i felt God kind of spoke to me. Don't ask when, why, where for your answer prayer just live by simple faith. As simple as these words may sound to some people but i kind of a understood what God wants to tell me.  We walk by faith.'  2 Cor 5 : 7                "
1602,Sagittarius,"                       I am so in love.  It is ridiculous.  I'm sure that he loves me too, but I don't know if he loves me with the intensity that I love him.  Shit I'm thinking of him throughout the day.  Talking about him constantly.  It seems to come from out of no where.  Natay this, Natay that.  I know people get tired of it.  I do too.  It only makes my fall harder and stay deeper in the feelings I cannot seem to control.  I just want to be with him forever.  It sucks, because when it doesn't happen I am going to be sooooo hurt.  Man, I can almost feel it just thinking about it.  Why can't I just have him.  I don't know if I can't, but I don't know if I can either.  This not knowing sure sucks.  I don't like it.  What did he do to make me fall for him so.  He is just wonderful.  He's beautiful.  He has a beautiful person.  He's so true and so honest.  How many guys out there are this good.  There probably are  a lot, but how much rubbish do you have to crawl through to find them.  Too much.  I just want to keep him.  It makes me feel so dreamy and so longing and the same time thinking about it.  I think I'd be so happy if I could be with him forever.  We have so much fun together.  Laughing, talking playing, smiling.  We just genuinely have a great time in each other's company.  Love, it is something funny isn't it.  The emotions it takes you through.  But it can feel so good.  Just being in love.  Man I want to see him right now.  I can wait until I see him this weekend.  I'm like a kid getting ready to go to Disney land for the first time.  May the lord bless me with sweet dreams tonight.               "

1608,Aries,"           Having grown up in Mississippi, I can say with some certainty that I agree with my future husband about his assessment of Lott.  He is intelligent and charismatic -- and ignorant as Mississippi Mud.  And I believe he, like many whites (and blacks, for that matter) from the Deep South, have latent issues with racism.  But I also agree that it's a social, not political issue.  Mississippi & Alabama really are almost different worlds from what goes on closer to the Mason-Dixon.  I had never seen such unconscious segregation until I moved there.  I am very happy to be further north now.  Remember also, Chris...that while Lott was attempting (poor thing) to cover his ass on BET (once again, having grown up in MS...BAAAAAHAAAAA!  you have no idea how funny THAT was for me)....he was asked why he voted against making MLK day a national holiday...and he responded by saying (this was voted on in 1983 or so, mind you) something to the effect of having not realized MLK's social-political-historical significance at the time.  What a jackass.  As for his future in the Senate, I don't really shive a git.  I don't live in MS anymore and am no longer directly affected by his decisions.  If government is what it was built to be, i. e. an accurate representation of its constituents, then Lott is a perfect representative for Mississippi and its beliefs.  So there ya go. I'm done.          "

1612,Pisces,"             Saw Year of the Rabbit again with S.O. the other night at Mercury Lounge. We stood right at the front and just smiled the whole time. Put simply: they're GREAT and play excellent rock and roll. It was fun seeing them after having heard the whole album. They opened their set with a cover of The Cure's 'PLAIN SONG'. That right there earns my respect. Afterwards, it was a quick stop at the Pub to catch up with Pater and then an Indian meal with my agent/lawyer/advisor/houseguest. Yes, I ate Indian food. S.O. is trying to make me more diverse. It's working...  Well the long awaited package arrived from Cracknation containing the next two Cracknation releases: Acumen Nation's 'LORD OF THE CYNICS' and a final yet unmastered version of the (extremely) long awaited and anticipated Chemlab album 'OXIDIZER', which as you may have read, I worked on a bit ;-)  Here are my brief thoughts:  'CYNICS' is the best written and produced Acumen record to date. The whole key to this album is Jason wisely making the most out of his new rythmn section, Dan and Eliot, and writing with them as a band. Their welcomed presence is very obvious in the material and the album is more akin to the live Acumen experience than any previous album. Also, Jason is finally singing more (something I had been nudging him to do for some time) and his grasp of melody is fantastic. the songs are catchier than the last album and the last song, CAPSULE, is a fantastic and soulful tune. Production is Cracknation standard, meaning its aces. I look forward to getting further into the album.  'OXIDIZER' is tougher to review because of my closeness to it. I co-wrote some of it, did a lot of sounds for it, and have been extremely passionate and vocal about this record for a long time. i can't review it. I am in love with 90% of the album and the other 10% I like but that mostly has to do with certain choices that were made for the album that I don't agree with, but thats real nitpicky stuff (i.e. 'oh i would turn the guitar up here' etc) and thats what happens in a band. 90% is a super figure. My curiosity about public reaction to the album is quite strong. I'm sure some fans will love it and others will not, and probably for the wrong reasons. They have to accept that this is 2003 and not 1995. This album is a full success and the hidden track on OXIDIZER will make the old schoolers happy!  Meanwhile...  Last night, S.O. and I saw the film SWIMMING POOL, which was quite good. I feel a certain member of the aggression, known for his love of the part of the female anatomy called the BOOBS, would like this movie, as it has a young woman running around without a top on quite a bit. Anyhow, I'm glad we saw this instead of SWAT.  Ash is in Boston visiting relatives, but informs Brandt that he will have an mp3 arrangement of 'THEME FROM PROPAGANDA' for us late tonight or tomorrow. Brandt intends to have some rough versions of the other songs for me on MP3 before I head back to LA tomorrow night. Hopefully this will happen and I will have a lot to study on the plane. What a great solo album? I'm home packing for LA and playing the new INDIANA JONES video game on mp3 while everyone else works on the songs. HAH! winner.  Seeing Saintface tonight...more later maybe.  F         "
1613,Pisces,"        I feel like a bum...a rushed, working bum. I can't muster the energy to exersize and I'm at a loss on my assignments. Work is horrid, relationships suck, and hole generated by the calories I burn at my job is immediately filled when I indulge myself in a three-dollar heath icerage afterwards. I need to call Ash but I'm on the depths of despair. I'm at the beginning of a long mood swing, a great bout of depression I haven't experienced in over seven months. I've had almost-longings of old friends, but thankfully haven't sunk so low to try to rekindle anything. Aloof and astute, that's me...or is it?    I HATE my depression. It comes at me in a rush, taking me by surprise (although in my subconscious I know it is inevitable) and leading me to a special hell reserved for my mind and body. A constant loathing of one's self, bitter hatred concerning one's body, occasional suicidal thoughts (none so far, this time) and a nightmarish feeling that every person is criticizing me all the time. This happens way too much. I hate it. I don't know if any words I give allusion to can represent these feelings as accurate as I would like. I read recently an article about silver amalgam tooth fillings consisting of half-mercury, a horribly dangerous neurotoxin, which leak mercury into your bloodstream and consequently your brain all the time (look it up if you don't believe me). 90% of people, after getting their silver fillings removed, never experienced depression again. I wonder if that's the kind of fillings I have...they certainly are all silver.     And like I said earlier...I don't have any clue about my newest assignment. The questions are hard. I can't comprehend them. They can mean any of three things to me at times. I wish they were easier to understand. Such as, 'What are contemporary activities and influences from Greece that overlapped the early developments in Italy?' What the hell does that mean?    God this entry is dark. Just ignore it, okay? It's total crap things coming out of my brain from somewhere-I-don't-know-where.      "
1614,Aquarius,"        IT'S RAINING NUPTIALS!!!   so last night iya and i went to our friend's wedding shower. she and her soon-to-be-husband are getting married in the philippines so this gathering was kinda like their reception with the friends and family who won't be able to attend the actual ceremony. they had it at the crystal springs hall in griffith park. for awhile iya and i were the only ones (aside from the bride and groom) we knew at the gathering until two more of the bride's friends, who are also our friends from high school, arrived. one of them brought her husband and the other girl is married too. these girls are two years older than us and when we were in high school we SO looked up to them. and yesterday we were all reminiscing about the IMAC glory days. iya and i listened for the most part and were beside ourselves laughing at all the antics and drama that high school doted upon us.  and then on the ride home, iya and i were talking about how, in the midst of all the nostalgia, we realized that these girls we admired in high school were now married women and how that could be one of us in 2 years' time. everyone knows how much I love weddings. i love so many things about it that most of you just roll your eyes at me when i start going on about it, but i can't help myself. and seeing and talking to our three friends yesterday just validated exactly how much it can mean, especially to the bride and groom experiencing it.   it's the day AFTER the wedding that the real part of marriage starts. it's the questionable days two people undergo when they're trying to decide if they can afford to buy their own home. it's the time when they're trying to figure out if they're ready to raise a family. all this time i've fallen in love solely with the preparations for the wedding itself; the flowers, the church, the dresses, etc, hardly ever thinking of the more important days thereafter. all i have to say is, i can't wait until one of you gets married cuz i know it'll really be something to remember.

1616,Taurus,"       I'm paranoid. I was thinking about this today at work when I sat at my desk wondering if everyone was talking about me; then wondering why I cared if they did or not?!   It all started on Monday when a good friend and co-worker announced that she'd quit. She had been off work on medical leave for quite some time, and when she came back, there were a few people out to get her (they really were - she wasn't being paranoid!). Well, she comes from an extremely wealthy family, so instead of fighting, just quit (she's been there for over 10 years). I'm happy for her really - she can spend time with her family and doesn't have to worry about the cattiness at the library. What threw me for a loop though&nbsp;was all the talk that was going on behind her back. The people cheering that she was going to leave. The other co-workers rushing to get their resumes together so they could apply for her job.   People do talk about other people… people do gossip, I know that. It goes on all the time in our staff lounge or in the elevator or by the loading dock… But I never really thought about people talking about me until I saw this explosion of 'hey, did you hear…' going on this week. It made me really start to wonder.   So as I sat at my desk this afternoon after a meeting, that didn't go so well - I started to speculate what others could be saying about me behind my back. As I was stewing, I decided to hop on the net and look up  paranoia  (At times I sure damn the people who put the internet together!). I found this article on the internet which said:    'Almost everyone experiences feelings of paranoia at some time in their lives. Paranoia is a perception that people are talking about you and spying on you, that they can't be trusted and do not have your best interest at heart. Paranoid people feel helpless and fear entrapment. They tend to be touchy, slow to forgive and quick to take offence. They feel victimized by what they perceive to be the overly critical attitudes and unjust anger of others. At the same time they are very self-conscious and critical of themselves. In an effort to defend against their own fears, they project a great deal of hostility and sarcasm toward significant others. '    Oh my God, that's ME!   I announced this revelation to my husband…his reply?&nbsp; 'Yeah, I know. But you're functional.'&nbsp; Ok, is this a real helpful response?! It gave me the ache-in-the-pit-of-your-stomach sort of feeling… He went on to clarify 'But honey, you're getting better.' All I want to do is find some hole to crawl into. If he knew, is this something that everyone knows? Can they tell I don't have it all held together? Why the hell am I worrying?!?! God, I am paranoid!   I suppose revelation is a step towards  cure , if cure is the right term. Maybe&nbsp; understanding  would be better. Perhaps I don't really need to be fixed or cured at all :)&nbsp; Just realizing what I do, and why I'm doing it, will help me to be more aware of my actions. Growth - it's something that never stops, eh?&nbsp;&nbsp; But I can do that in the moring... right now&nbsp;I'm going to go find that hole...            "

1619,Pisces,"             Beat from what seems like a week of non stop insanity, I will try to recollect the past few days to the best of my abilities.  First off, SPIDERMAN 2 was nothing short of excellent. I don't think it's any secret that I love the first hour of the original film and hate the second hour of bad CGI, plot holes the size of mars, and bad pacing. For me, and as some of you know, comic book movies are my 'thing', and I can find very little I didn't like about SPIDEY 2. Every huge problem I had with the first movie, some of which are listed about, was addressed and it seems Sony has lifted the shackles off of Mr. Raimi and have allowed him to make not just a great superhero movie, but a great Sam Raimi film. A lot of the the quirkiness of his earlier work shines through here, and don't even get me started on the awesome Bruce Campbell cameo. Anyway, see it. Repeatedly.   As planned, the entire crew got together Thursday night for a long listening/commentary session on the current status of EXIT STRATEGIES. Well, they got half of the record, really, but mostly the stuff that have made leaps and bounds in recent weeks. Of everything, OUR FAITH, received an overhwelming thumbs up from the group as did all of Charles' recent contributions. Thats not to say everything was peachy keen. Charles and Ash (and occasionally poor Robin, who I think was asleep most of the time) had a lot to say, and luckily in our grown up post-aggression drama years, their comments can be taken as how they are intended: to HELP improve the material. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean I agree with all of what they say, but these are the people who's opinions matter most and what they say WILL permeate my brain. It's nice working with people who don't have the ego's the size of continents and are trying to push you to be better at what you dol.  Anyhow, notes were taken, suggestions were addressed, and by the end of the night, we had Charles hard at work on re-recording Ash's basslines for MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE. Charles lent a whole new dynamic to the song, and wisely took the opportunity to play his parts in and out and around my various F-basslines (no longer Hook-basslines, ok?) to create some awesome dueling melodies and a sweeter chorus than the one we had written (and without making it sound like fucking Ned's Atomic Dustbin). Because of that, I edited a significant amount of my own bass out, which now makes those lines that much more dramatic when they enter the song. I'm psyched!  Well believe it or not, everyone had huge and I mean HUGE problems with the revamped 1956. At first, internally, I was a bit defensive about it, especially when Ash begged for it to be turned off (fucking drama queen), but once we got into a discussion about it and started to dissect the parts of the song, I began to understand the real problems of this song. The band really gave me the ability to stand back and look at this song, flaws and all. Along with Charles' new bass in MORNING, this was the most signficant thing that came out of the group meeting.  It was a fun night, and I got a ton of positive feedback from the aggression members on the artwork for the new remix album. I'm going to step away from it for a bit to gain some perspective and get back to it. Of course, during the evening, everyone stole each others IPODS and traded music. Ah, the modern age. So, much appreciation to Robin, Ash, and Charles for making some time for the Factor Corp. I would say 3/4 of what they suggested will be incorporated. the 1/4 is just artsy crap that they can do in their own band (j/k). Speaking of which, their material just improves by the second. I'm really feeling what they are doing...and you will too.  I think the group comments on 1956 effected Brandt as well as we spent a lot of Friday just talking about the song and what didn't work, etc. This led to Brandt and I meeting up early this morning to get to work on the next wave of this difficult song. Charles had called the song a musical 'Franksentein' as it had lots of good parts, but nothing that tied them together. Also, everyone seemed to have issues with the fact that there were so many loops. The new intro that I busted my ass on last week went out the door and I went back to the quick bang immediate start of the track (like THE MOTIVE). Then, the next thing we did was strip the song to its bare essentials of guitar, bass, drums and strings. Taking Charles' advice, I grabbed my bass, and B busted out his 12-string and we went and wrote a new section of the song that would successfully bridge the verse and chorus. It took a LONG time, it was a lot of hard work, but once we did this, we knew we had this song in a million times better place than it was when we started. It totally made sense to us why this song, up until this point, hadn't worked right. Brandt really took this one and ran and did several melodic and rocky guitar tracks to flesh it all out. While he was working out his parts, I was able to go into the computer and do some cool sound design on the guitar line I played in the verses. I smoothed it out, made it a little bit otherworldly and it fits much better within the song. Brandt later went in and re-did some of his verse wah guitars while I tightened robin's drums up to make it much more dance, more Stone Roses-y, which you know I love.  Again, none of this was easy, but it was totally worth it. This new section works incredibly and we were able to change the big guitar solo towards then end to incorpoate this new section (believe it or not, the solo fit perfectly over it). With that, I went and created a new arrangement that has VERY few loops (maybe some one bar loop flourishes every now and then) and can easily be played by a rock band live.   I got some Wanton Garden to go straight outta Chinatown as well as some DVDS (including the new BETTER TOMORROW remastered box set, which everyone should own instead of renting PAYCHECK). I checked out the new Andy Lau movie JIANG HU (also starring Irene's favourite Cantopop idol Edison Chen), but the movie was a bit lacking. Great idea, poor execution. Nice DVD package though.   10 bucks to anyone who can figure out what the hell happened to the release of the new Die Warzau album! It's killing me!  F         "
1620,Pisces,"        such a smile takes away all worry how strong hands can cup and hold so gently my face a gentle kiss melts the world away making this depression slip aside into the light  some days are so horrible I know the pain that lurks within me and how it creeps  taunting me with the loss of you filling me with fear that you may leave   you help me fight. you give me strength so I may fight harder  I will make it go away! with you beside me, I will overcome this pain and torment...

1621,Scorpio,"       I love fireflies/lightning bugs.   The glimpses of light in the darkness are incredibly comforting for me, little bits of hope. I remember catching them when I was really little, and keeping them in jars with holes punched in the lids.  I had to let them out before I went to bed though, otherwise they'd be dead by morning. One night, freshman year I was over at a family friend's house out in the country, and we were all out in the yard.  I was playing with the little kids who were catching the fireflies.  They would all catch one and bring it to me to hold in my hands.  After I while I had ten or so cupped in my hands, and one of the little girls was convinced that when I let them go, they would all fly up, and make a little lighted circle in the air.  It was a little weird, but I thought it was cute.  I told one of the guys I was dating at the time about this... maybe Travis or Ishmael {that was before I stopped dating Rockhurst guys} and he said something like, 'If I had known fireflies would capture your heart, I would have caught you one a long time ago.'  I thought that was really cute too, until he brought me an envelope full of dead fireflies the next time I saw him.  I was so upset that he had killed them all, that was the last time I talked to him I think. I also remember going out to catch them at a sleepover in first grade, and squishing their glowing tails onto our skin to make interestingly beautiful, yet morbid and shortlived jewelry.   I'm thinking if I get a tripod, and leave my shutter open long enough I could capture a whole field of them on film...  .:ponders:.  pray that it rains tonight so I can get some sleep...    "
1622,Aries,"           i think ted rall has lost his goddamn mind.  and if what he is writing is true, then why does he feel safe even publishing it?  urlLink http://www.uexpress.com/tedrall/site/viewru.htm          "
1623,Cancer,"       So... I had this nice long informative post all written up the other night when all of a sudden the power went out and I lost it.  Don't you love it when that happens?  I shall now attempt to recreate it in short form.    urlLink The Saints and Sinners of Okay County - Dayna Dunbar  This is a great retro novel (set in 1976 or so) in small town Oklahoma.  Aletta Honor is pregnant with her fourth child and has no idea where her husband is at the moment.  With a stack of bills to pay, she is getting desperate.  She attempts to set up a kolache stand during the annual Czech Festival but she burns them all and has to settle for peddling lemonade.  After she uses her long hidden psychic powers to save the life of a customer, she decides to put a sign up in the front yard and offer psychic readings from her home.  Town and husbandly drama ensues, but Aletta knows she is doing what she should be doing.  This was a great novel.    Nostalgia rules.  I've been on a teen novel kick lately.  These are all good ones.  urlLink Gingerbread - Rachel Cohn   urlLink All American Girl - Meg Cabot   urlLink The Earth, My Butt, and Other Big Round Things    urlLink Filthy Rich - Dorothy Samuels  Not a teen novel although I did find it in the Young Adult section.  If 34 is now considered young adult... yay!  This was a cute read.   urlLink Meely LaBauve - Ken Wells   I found this book in the Young Adult section at the  urlLink library  but I wouldn't really consider it that genre.  The main character is a 15 year old boy but the subject matter is a little mature.  Of course, it isn't anything I wasn't reading (or doing for that matter) at that age.  It is touted as the Cajun Huck Finn, but I have to disagree there as well.  It is much better!  This is a must read or any age, male or female.     urlLink Can You Keep A Secret - Sophie Kinsella  Yet another gem.  I've been anxiously awaiting her next novel, and this one was well worth the wait.  Funny, charming, witty.  Everything it should be.  I was hooked.  And I have read where the movie rights have already been scooped up.  Although Kate Hudson is set to play the main character and I don't really see her as fitting the part, not that I don't like her but it just isn't her.    urlLink The Breathtaker - Alice Blanchard  This was one wild ride of a book.  Set in Tornado Alley (which is where I live) this murder mystery is an experience.  I love it when a book is in familiar settings, you can learn something from it, and it keeps you hooked.  It took me much longer than usual to figure out whodunit in this one.  I definitely recommend this one.          "
1624,Sagittarius,"             Yep, this is been a '1,2,3' weekend for me (as indicated by the topic title). Now for some more in depth discussion of each of these things:   1 Week of Summer School Down:  Friday marked the end of my first week of summer school (and the equivalent of the end of the 1st 6 Weeks). My first real speech is on Monday, so I have to finish preparing for it over the weekend. It has to be an informative speech with no visual aid, so I decided to do it over HDTVs. My second one will be on Wednesday which is an informative speeck with a visual aid, and I think I'll do that one on either the Egyptian Pyramids or the Sphinx.   2 SAT II Tests:  Today I took my first two SAT II tests, Writing and Mat IIC. I could have done a third, but I didn't feel like doing Spanish and there was no way I was going to do Physics. I'll probably do 1 or 2 more at the start of next school year.   3 for 3 on HP Movies:   Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban  definitely gets two thumbs up from me. It left out quite a bit that was in the book, but since most everyone that is going to see the movies has already read the book, the stuff they left out was fine. I don't know if I would say it was better than the second one (Chamber of Secrets), but there's no way it was worse.  That about covers my weekend so far. Nothing big planned for tomorrow except for working on my speeches, but who knows what could pop up at the last moment.         "

1626,Aquarius,"             There are a few ways to beat the heat here in Seoul. One is to simply stay at work, but with the government-imposed  urlLink 5-day work-week  coming into effect (and since I can't really figure out why I'd work 7 days a week) that isn't a very viable option. You could go to the beach, but it tends to get a little crowded (as  urlLink this story  attests). Or, you can go see movies. If you do, though, as I noted in a  urlLink past blog , get ready for some comedy--and I mean before the movie starts. One of my favorite theatres is the brand-new Fantaseum in Daehangro. The staff there have some pretty wild costumes. There is a Chipper's restaurant on the top 2 floors too (where apparently the food isn't so hot, but there's a magic show to extertain the kids). The Chipper's staff (even the guys) have aprons and lace collars on their uniforms, and the female theatre staff have, get this, wings. Ya, they're dressed as angels. See pics.   urlLink     Angels complete with wings and Squid...the whole squid   They also all have this cute (well, hilarious is more appropriate) little salute they do when they greet you and say good-bye. They put their left hand on their hip, their right hand up (as if they're swearing on a bible) and touch their fingertips together while at the same time bending their knees. All this they do with a smile on their face. (If you don't get my description, think of a gay Nazi doing a Heil Hitler and you'll be pretty close.) Man, the things people do for part-time work.  Oh ya, the squid is there for general interest. It's restaurant display. I've seen dishes with hacked-up squid in it, but not one with (what looks like at least) a whole squid on the plate. Interesting.  Anyhoo, this weekend I saw 3 movies...one Korean and two Western ones (not spaghetti Westerns, just non-Korean/foreign). The Korean one was  urlLink (형님들의 도시)목포는항구다  (Hyung-nim-deul-ui do-shi mok-po-neun-hang-goo-da, or Mok-po: Gangster's Paradise). It was a pretty entertaining film, although some Korean humor I'm still trying to figure out. It goes from serious to amusing to gross in like 3 frames. One scene is with these 3 minor gangsters who are so poor they have to eat dogfood, but it gives them the runs and later (when you least expect it) a serious scene cuts to them running into a single-stall public loo. Well, the senior guy goes in and prepares to blast-off (so to speak) but the seatcover falls and he lets loose on it instead of into the bowl. They show you the mess oozing from between the cover and his legs and even outside the stall where it envelopes the (bare, for some reason) foot of his junior. My God, is there anything more repugnant? These guys were kind of a show-stealer (or a party-pooper, depending on your viewpoint).   urlLink     Mokpo, Gangster's Paradise; King Arthur; I, Robot    urlLink King Arthur  was...ok. Lots of action and killing and Braveheart-like speeches, but I can only give it a 3 or 3.5 out of 5. If you've seen Lord of the Rings this one will seem kinda washed out.  I did, however, find that one of the characters, Bors, to be much like my bud from Manchester, Alex. He also resembled Alex's business partner, Mark, but I met Alex first so he gets top billing. Reading about  urlLink the actor, Ray Winstone,  I learned that the character was much like the actor and both were like Alex. Life imitating art imitating life?   urlLink     Alex Bors and Mark...which is which?   I, Robot was pretty cool. I think I may have read part of the book way back in high school (geek that I was/am). The movie had a TON of special effects in it, but (seeing as it was in the future) they all made sense. Things, for some reason, didn't seem over the top, but that may be because I've been desensitized by now. I, Robot gets a 4 out of 5...or, for those out there who are not into sci-fi, a 3 out of 5....hey, Will Smith is in it! Oh, and the naked butt scenes are equal opportunity: one of Will (but I closed my eyes for that one), one of the girl (but I told my wife I closed my eyes for  that  one).  Well, that's it...a pretty boring weekend, for once. Actually got all the sleep I needed for once. I'm sure I won't make that mistake again for a long time.          "
1627,Cancer,"                 So I finished Fellowship of the Rings today, and it was...okay. There was a bit of trudging through here and there, but not too bad. The movie didn't do a bad job of following the storyline, all things considered, though the book did fill in some of the plot holes for me (like why Gimli didn't know all the dwarves in Moria died). And I must say, while there are some discrepancies between the book and movie voices of certain characters (i.e. the way they talk, words they use, etc), which are understandable aftereffects of adapting book to film, the characters of Sam and Gollum are just SPOT ON. I had no trouble placing the movie voices into the book characters at all, whereas I did with other characters. This probably has more to do with the way the dialogue is adapted than with the strength of the actors though.   I just looked up John Rhys-Davies on IMDB. I KNEW I've heard that name somewhere. He played Professor Arturo on  Sliders  and Leonardo Da Vinci in a few episodes of  Star Trek: Voyager . I loved his portrayal of both characters, but I didn't recognize him the entire time I watched the trilogy. Probably because he's normally twice as tall.               "

OF coarse the 'band' we have now hasn't done anything, and at this rate, I don't think that we will be doing anything. The brother and Lilly came over today. Dunno. I didn't hang with them much.

1631,Virgo,"                 Okey dokey, i'm sitting in Gordon Library and talking to Ken over e-messenger. I'm using e-messenger because the library computers are so restricted it won't even let me check my e-mail. So why am i sitting in Gordon Library at 3 'o' clock in the afternoon? Well today i spent the whole day at Macquarie University for Japanese continuers day. It was pretty interesting, worth missing school over. Anyway it ended at 2 and i got a lift with Ken to Gordon station, where i'm waiting for my environmental science book to return to me. I could be home, but i'm here instead. Walking into the library at 2:30 was a bit strange. All the librarians and people were giving me weird looks that said 'why the hell are you here, shouldn't you be at school?'. Libraries are so empty during the day. Funny moment: when David Kim got the phone number of a Hornsby Girl he thought he knew from somewhere.       "

1634,Scorpio,"       At my dad's this weekend in Henderson.  I've had an okay time, but there seems to be a lot of tension between my dad and Lisa.  Not sure what is going on...maybe it's Matt living here-I don't know.  All I really do know is how it affects me-its very saddening.  I don't think I could really deal with another break up.  They all mean so much to me.  If someone was to have told me five years ago that my parents would be divorced, and I would love new people, I would have laughed at them and contritely waved them away.  Shit happens, things change, and life moves on.  I think I can say that though I'm not happy about the divorce, I am happy with how I have grown because of it.  Wouldn't it suck if I couldn't learn from bad situations?  Yup-I think so.  I told God three days ago, that I would pray every day for a husband, until he brought me.  I'm serious about this one. I'm fed up with waiting.  I am having a hell of a time managing my temptive urges-boys are all around me-and even the ugly ones are beginning to look quite attractive.  I'm not lonely-it's just once you've opened the forbidden box of sex-it's hard to not want to open it again.  I have been succesful thus far in praying for a husband...but it's only day three...we'll see in two or three months-heck a week :)  I'm getting along much better with David and Mom as a couple.  I love them both and have really come to respect each of them together and separately.  I am not sure why it took me so long to accept David.  Mostly because I thought he wasn't good enough for her, based on his looks. He's certainly not what I consider good looking-but his intelligence and compassion certainly make up for it.  Sure-he's heavey handed and loud mouthed-but then again-maybe I am too.   eXpedition: is okay-I'm a little disenchanted with it at this point-and having a hard time sticking in there.  I would love to move on to another church that is much more stable and established.  But it seems to be my pattern that I leave when it gets too tough-so I'm just asking God to help me through the hard time.  God-if you read this-which you are probably doing now-please help me.  I need you to move in my friendships at eXpedition and help me to better serve those in the church.  I want to bless those around me-but I can't if everyone hates me due to misconceptions presented by tainted opinions.  Help me to love Courtney. If I could beat her up in a dark alley somewhere, I would-but I know that's not right, and deep in my heart I do love her, it's just hard to show it when she insists on hurting me. But God is bigger than my feelings and my fleshly desires.  I'm missing Drew like crazy.  He hasn't written me any email-not called-no letter-nothing.  I feel like discarded trash-and it's hard to understand why he doesn't communicate in some manner.  If he does love me, even as a close friend, why doesn't he contact me? Doesn't he realize that, that is what friends do?  Guess not.  I did send him two emails-the first was really encouraging-the second relayed irritation and frustration.  I plan on sending him a letter to let him know how I really feel, but I need an address first.  I was watching Tombstone tonight, and there is a scene at the end where Jody looks in the mirror after a show.  She's not looking at herself, but instead looking into the future with regret, regret that she didn't tell Wyatt exactly how she felt, that she didn't care about any of his faults, and just wanted to spend the rest of her life with him.  I identified greatly with that look-and felt a twinge of pain in the pit of soul, that I too, would one day feel this.  God-please don't let this happen to me.  Well-guess that's enough for now.  I love my life God-I just want someone to share it with.  Love-Faith         "
1635,Aquarius,"       Unsurprisingly, it is the 14 of june. I have been spending my time most often in Npcc, but many things have past that worthed my attention and pondering.   The Angel Well over my days i must say, i have valued and tried to learn as much as possible. I read the book, Woman can't read maps and men just can't listen. Haha, strange choice ehh? It made me understand the difference between men and woman and why such difference exist, and what we can do to prevent pressing the red button. Now i move on to a new book written by a famous and good writer, R.A Salvatore who wrote many good series. I have only managed to the first book among the hundreds.    Other than that, it has been most satisfying to win another battle against the odds. Perhaps i have played too long and the expierance have been instilled upon me or perhaps my opponent needed more time.  Another attributes which i have gained over the days was being able to control myself over problems and everything. Being composed in difficult or tough situations is a most useful skill. I have to thank warhammer for that...haha  The devil  There are always evil thoughts which sprouted in my youthful mind. Sometimes it pays to heed its call but i must not be misled. Now i realise more that firends are the essential ladder steps to climb to the top. But perhaps it is nothng more than a evil thought. Still it makes sense, other than simple ladder steps friends provide companionship and someone to talk to. Now i must try to get rid of it.Begone creature of hell!  The dark  Since from last week, my good cousin or rather my best friend had left for army. I miss his companionship and a listener for my sorrows and joys, and nevertheless some good laughters.Still i cant change anything it is beyong my capability to prevent it. Though I was glad that he was positive about it instead of frowning.   Npcc has took up most of my time, spending my time sitting on iron steel chairs and listening to chants. Much time is wasted, a good thing is i can practice my body language reading. Managed to read a few but still i'm not very good at it.  The shooting competition was of my msot regret in this past ten days? Yes it was the most regretful thing. I didnt expect that i have enough time, so i didnt aim for the shooting competition. I have only managed to score a score of 93 which was fairly poor although i pass. I didnt try my best was the worst mistake i have commited!Now i truly wish for a time machine.           "

1638,Aquarius,"        AAAAAAAHHHHH!!! OH CRAAAAAP!!!!   that's what Annie, Ate, Gwen, Leia and I sounded like all saturday, screamin' every few hours as we plummeted from as high as 255 feet in the air to the ground, twisting through corkscrews and hanging upside down on the way. we spent the day at magic mountain to celebrate Annie and Will's birthdays. it's been approximately 7 years since i last visited so everything seemed like new to me...except of course that unnerving feeling of nausea each time we inched our way to the front of the lines. i willingly admit that i am not a big rollercoaster fan. i get all kinds of nervous at the thought of those drops. the hanging upside down doesn't make me feel as sick but oh the 250 ft drop at 85 mph sure make my stomach churn.   so ate, leia, annie, will and i got to valencia at about 10:30 or 11 am. since we were meeting gwen later that afternoon, we decided to forego the newer rides until she got there. so we rode Revolution first. this used to be my favorite ride for some reason, i'm not sure why. after that we headed to viper. we stood in line for what seemed like 45 minutes or so. i forgot how bumpy that ride got towards the end. my head was just bobbling between the headrests --ouch! we met with gwen and then had some lunch.  after some lasagna, we headed to Goliath. i don't know how many of you have been on this ride but it is definitely the scariest i've ever been on because of the very first thing that happens...a 255 foot drop! oh my gosh, i listened to the tick-tick-tick as coaster made its way up the ramp before it shot down to the ground like 50 billion times while we were in line. by the time we finally got to the loading area i was like eeeks, i can't do this. i know i'm such a coward but i can't help it. i was so ready to tell them i'd wait for them at the exit. but i said, screw it anna, just go!...and i did. oh did i scream! i thought we were never gonna hit the bottom the drop was so long! (hey iya, remember how we thought the jurrassic drop was long?...well, that definitely pales in comparison to GOLIATH!). but i made it.  we rode SCREAM after GOLIATH. ate tin-tin is very apprehensive when it comes to twists and turns and upside down motions because she gets sick easily, but somehow we got her on this ride which is all about those things AND MORE. the speed of that ride is insane. it's name is as appropo as you can get. i think we turned over at least 9 times. I LOVED IT! but poor ate couldn't get herself on another rollercoaster after that. she sat out BATMAN, which i LOVE cuz the ride is so smooth. too bad the line was 1 1/2 hours long and the ride lasted oh, 2-3 minutes!!! yuck! that's all i hate about theme parks! lines take up such a significant amount of your day. after batman, Annie, Will, Leia and Gwen headed towards X-TREME. ate and i were like no way man. if you haven't seen this thing it's like this. first of all, there are two seats on each side of the car, hanging on some type of rotar. it turns depending on the motion of the coaster. in other words, it hangs independently from the car itself so you don't know which way the seat will turn if, say, you're entering a corkscrew. i can't explain it but i KNEW i couldn't do it yesterday so ate and i had a little dinner, shopped a little and rode the carousel. ha ha ha...  we got home at about 11 pm already even though we left the park at 9:30 cuz there was an accident on the 5.   whew...what a day! full of screams!!! but i can't deny how much fun i had. there's nothing like a day at a theme park with great company!

1640,Taurus,"           I used to be on a triathlon team with this guy.   ++++++++++++++ A quick story about Spence in Afghanistan.   From Afghanistan, Story of the week:  So we are up in the mountains at about 0100 hrs looking for a bad guy that we thought was in the area. Here are ten of us, pitch black, crystal clear night, about 25 degrees. We know there are bad guys in  the area, a few shots have been fired but no big deal. We decide that we need air cover and the only thing in the area is a solo B-1 bomber. He flies around at about 20,000 feet and tells us there is nothing in the area. He then asks if we would like a low level show of force.  Stupid question. Of course we tell him yes.  The controller who is attached to the team then is heard talking to the pilot. Pilot asks if we want it subsonic or supersonic.  Very stupid question. Pilot advises he is twenty miles out and stand  by.    The controller gets us all sitting down in a line and points out the proper location.  You have to picture this. Pitch black, ten killers sitting down, dead quiet and overlooking this about 30 mile long valley.  All of a sudden, way out (below our level) you see a set of four 200' white flames coming at us. The controller says, 'Ah-- guys-- you might want to plug your ears'. Faster than you can think a B-1, supersonic, 1000' over our heads, blasts the sound barrier and it feels like God just hit you in the head with a hammer'.

1641,Gemini,"   i seem to have signed up for a blog. my intention was to post a comment after seeing my name used in some kind of article on a blog entitled http://dontyouhatepants.blogspot.com.. i know now it was written by an old friend named nicholas 'zach morris' mcdowell, but at first glance (from a link on the schroek blog) i thought i was being fooled by some kind of cookie-manipulating, sarcasm-generating cyborg joke site. i seem to have been half right. anyway, i might as well tell you about my week and mention that if you visit the 'hate pants' site you'll see i made some comment about cowing out. cowing out? i've never known a soul who would  store such a phrase in their vocabulary. i felt i needed to respond and now i've got a fucking blog. i do however use the word 'anywho.'  my week.  anywho last saturday was a trip to one of the half dozen fabulous cinemas on houston st, the sunshine, for a first-time viewing of the princess bride. i went with max oglesbee, his sister phoebe (13 yo), and her friend abby. they were practically hyperventilating at the midnight showing of one of their favorite movies, and it was as fun to watch them as it was to watch the movie itself. we met tara lorenzen for a brief minute before the movie. she was at the sidewalk cafe on avenue a (gorgeous phrase right?) and carried her beer out with her in her purse. tara and i went into the ace bar on 5th street, watched pat moynihan botch a game of pool, introduced tara to rob, then walked her to the train and went to see the movie. highlight of the evening was the after-film piss with max, where my comment on mark knopfler's soundtrack got a surprising chuckle out of the urinal between us, a man who later commented that the rainbow colored rainboots we used to sneak beer into the movie theatre were 'the kind of shit i'm talking about!' whatever-in-the-living fuck that meant. seriously, that hombre was 'cowed out.'  sunday i worked at my part-time 2-day a week for a free membership job at the 92nd street Y. its a cultural center more than a gym, and you can learn more about it at http://www.92ndsty.org.   monday i was invited by a dear friend mr. josh peskowitz to a fader magazine/cornerstone party at a gallery space on 18th street betwixt 9th and 10th. free beers provided by red stripe and harp, a free show of ted leo/the pharmacists and the libertines. the libertines were great looking, and ted leo was great sounding. at least to me. i'm not sure if max o. and jersey walz, my friends in attendance, enjoyed, but i certainly did. a vague head-nod and hello to a mr. james iha, in attendance; who ten years ago would have made me crawl across the floor to gush unscripted professions of adoration. nice to see he's still... turning japanese. i really think so. the after party at the maritime hotel was more of a before party. max and i left before it seemed to really get off the ground.  tuesday i was at the gym again and at the evening took a phone call from danielle florio to hear about the last phish show. despite not being a fan, i was enthralled at the experiences she encountered and couldn't help the mild pangs of jealousy i felt at missing what seemed a pretty historic event. slept well for the first time in all of august i think, drifting to sleep with images of vermont dancing vicariously through my head.  wednesday at the libraries all day, researching and editing an old piece of nonfiction. et ceteras...  thursday i had lunch with jersey walz, a brief stop at her father's lawyer's apartment on 72nd and central park west. had her homemade granola for the first time since the day she left for italy last summer. with rice milk. i gave her 12 blues songs on a cd-r, and she gave me a bag of granola to go. saw her new portrait camera ( a knockout ), some of her mother's antartica photos, and then hailed her a cab outside the building on the way to port authority. workers were tearing up the sidewalk out in front of the dakota, where 24 years ago john lennon was shot. i'm sure its been replaced several times since, but i had to wonder. rode with her bags and waited with her till she got on her bus to boston. she's staying at kurt vonnegut's house in barnstable mass this week, and will probably have some extraordinary photographs of the author and the ocean when she returns. you'd think in such a situation a man who pretends to be mildly intellectual could've figured out a way to get hisself invited along, but i was too stunned to even think of it.   and then afterwards i went to r.a.w. cuts barber shop next door to my building for a haircut. only white face in the premises. normally i can get by in these kinds of situations; talk hip-hop, talk jazz, talk r&b, talk movies. these particular guys just weren't havin' it. listened to my barber anthony tell me about the finer points of black pussy, asian women, and the barbershop basketball league. my big white irish face reflected off two mirrors, and a deep sadness that i could not, after all, 'hang.' but after the cut (45 minute cut for $12 bones, unbelievable), they invited me back to chill out front and have some beers. anthony's brother stanley told one of the best stories i've ever heard. one of those classics where nothing really happens, and its all in the telling (and unlike this one you're reading), but damn!  friday was a gem. worked the Y in the morning, tutored a 4th grader in math in the bronx after lunch, a college student in queens (requiring a 1.75 hour train ride through brooklyn to richmond hill), and then back to another student's on the lower east side. in all, four boroughs before dinner. danielle florio took the train in from westchester and met me on 125th street. i showed her my new harlem apartment, which she loved more than i ever will. we had a beer in the living room and then dined at the quintessential soul food restaurant, charles' southern fried chicken on 152nd and 8th avenue. the world's best fried chicken, in case you were wondering. the ribs, collards, sweet potatoes, and pulled pork are also in the world's top ten. took a stroll through one of my favorite neighborhoods in all of new york, the well-preserved and oft-overlooked hamilton heights. i love taking people over there and talking my usual over-factual conversation through these near-silent, immaculate streets. its about convent avenue from 145th to 135th, with a stroll down hamilton terrace at 143rd to see the house used by wes anderson in the royal tenenbaums. at 141st the preserved former house of alexander hamilton, where he lived from 1802-04, when he was killed in a duel in... of all places...hoboken.... saw a sign across from hamilton's crib stating 'apartments $1000-1600,' prompting me to speculate ways to get out of my lease.  and so we're only at 10pm on friday. waited at the D train stop on 125th, at a popeyes, for danielle's new boyfriend peter atlas. a very sweet and overwhelmingly laid back cat from middletown ny, who accompanied us back to my place while i took a shower. while i was in the shower, six gunshots rang out from a guy going by on a motorcycle. i didn't hear it at all, but the hip couple in my living room swore it was true. lenox ave was shut down right outside my window, and our ride to the evening's party was mildly rerouted.  the evening's party was at the yankee ferry, a boat parked on pier 23 in tribeca, at the end of north moore st. to be brief, which i haven't been, its a boat owned by a friend of a friend. a 1909 former staten island ferry, its the only boat in manhattan you can live on, and since the owners were gone for the weekend, max o. was in charge. which meant a very rare opportunity for a small gathering on the upper deck, surrounded by the financial district, the holland tunnel ventilation towers, abandoned piers, and the warehouses of tribeca. out in the hudson, a gorgeous, humid evening, with a collective of great folks celebrating morgan whirledge's 21st birthday. a well-timed joint created a blur of wildly nonsensical topics of conversation, one of them being the heaven better than the heaven from stairway to heaven. I know you're thinking 'stairway to better heaven,' but actually we preferred to call it 'stairway to uber-heaven.' max described this particular heaven in these quotes below, which i scrawled on an atm receipt in my pocket and deciphered this morning.  'stairway to uber-heaven, the eiffel 94 supersonic master plan! the relative major of the tonic brigade! did i say tunnel bridge? you can't have a tunnel that's a bridge, that's impossible.'  after this, we calmed down slightly, and max told morgan and i another one of the best stories i've ever heard: the entire history of the yankee ferry. it included trips through both world wars, decades-long tours as a staten and block island ferry, and its last ten years as a historical landmark and a controversial eyesore in the new york harbor. a completely fascinating story, including how the boat got its water, electricity, and its docking privileges. it wouldn't be worth mentioning at all if it wasn't in constant threat of sinking or being removed from the pier by the ny/nj port authority.   on the pier at around three (vagueness starting to settle in), we took off from the boat and ran through the sand of the beach volleyball courts on the adjoining pier. soft sand between the toes is a luxury rarely known by the city resident, while the drunk city resident ponders the beauty of lying down in it and never getting up again.  and so that brings me to tonight. just returned from a relaxing evening spent at a party in the building on the fourth floor. played three vicious games of spades at the card table in the kitchen, where despite a rusty start, finished the last two games with my teammate julio in the victory collumn. the last game went to a third tie-breaker, all bets wagered, a crowd of onlookers and four spades left in my hand for the final rounds. won the last two hands for a meager ten points victory. risked it all and came out huge. could have spent the evening hitting on the pretty peruvian girl celia who came into my apartment hours before looking for one of my roommates, and instead i played cards with a harlem local, a brooklyn native, and a spaniard. and a white boy from upstate new york who has a lot more game with a stack of cards then with the ladies.   so that's my week. i wanted to post it and then maybe someday i can come back to it and seen what i did mid-august of 2004. i'm not much into the blogging thing. the reason the post is so long is because well, i can see this being the one and only post of this site. i've had better weeks and plan to have better ones still, but its nice every once in a while to capture this shit and have it the way it was when i remembered it freshly, and not out of some haze of a few years on. who knows. hope you enjoyed.

Could be.&nbsp; urlLink     He needs to stop coming here, he makes my heart go all fluttery when he just keeps following me with his eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mostly I just like the attention, but I also like to pretend that he is just this certain type of person, when it is very obvious he is not. No I shouldn't say very obvious, becuase if it were that blatant I wouldn't have all of these sordid ideas in my head. He waits for me to say hi to him because he knows that I have to, I'm occupationaly bound to say hello.&nbsp; And he knows that I know his name and either he gets kicks out of this or he is just as shy and reserved as I can be.&nbsp; He showed me a few of his tattoos one day but seemed inconvenienced by my questions.&nbsp; When he is in my cube he's rather reserved and guarded, he snidely remarks about school and moving to New Orleans. He's a bit haughty, but that just makes him all the more challenging. And if there is nothing I like more about a boy it's that he's damn near impossible to snag.&nbsp; But there will be no snagging for me.&nbsp; Not even a vain attempt at asserting myself into his life.&nbsp; I'm just gonna watch him walk in and out that revolving door and simply admire the slightly homosexual white sweater he's wearing.&nbsp; Some days he borders on a gay bike messenger and a savvy thrift store shopper.&nbsp; What's even more fun is that he looks a lot like Thom Yorke.&nbsp; He's just so strange it intrigues me.&nbsp; He follows me around the lobby, his head always facing my direction even when he is conducting business in the opposite, but he's always hanging in my peripheral vision. He never quite focuses on me so it's not exactly like staring.&nbsp; He is just such a weirdo.&nbsp; He won't come and talk to me, it's obvious he likes me, so instead he just stares at our receptionist desk if I am making copies.&nbsp; I guess it's all for the better though. I don't need no damn temptation, especially with all of these crazy hormones wreaking havoc on my feminine judgments.&nbsp; Damn hormones     "

1645,Gemini,"                 I went to St. Francis today to watch their production of Shakespear's   Hamlet .  I myself, not being completely up on the whole theater and play deals, thought it sucked.  I'm not really up on it, but I do know a little bit about it.  Most plays changes the stage during the different acts, not this one.  I also know that Hamlet is a long play and is somewhat hard to follow, but this was horrible.  Amlet, Hamlet's father who was murdered in the play, was played by the same guy as Hamlet's uncle.  Sound confusing?  It was.  For some reason the person playing Hamlet was also scripted to be shirtless, a lot.  It was attempted to be modernized, but only parts of the play were actually done.  The result to me was a shotty version of what I assume to be a good play.  This was my first time seeing any performance of Hamlet.  Unless you count the highly abridged version that our high school did last year.   I have other things on my mind at the moment as well, but can't put them to words.  I haven't decided if thats a good thing or a bad thing yet.      "

I'm not having much luck.  Mainly because a lot of sites that are listed have no pictures and no information, they are just addresses.  Most of them don't even have a web site or email...I mean what century do they think they are living in???  No web site?  This isn't the stoneage.

1654,Gemini,"           So, there I am. Standing in front of the fridge at the supermarket. All I wanted to do was to buy some  urlLink orange juice . That's all. Nothing more. But there was so much  urlLink choice . Orange juice with added calcium, Orange Juice with added vitamins A,C, and E, Orange Juice with boosted Vitamin C, etc. I shouldn't have to put that much thought into an orange juice purchase should I? It's madness.   What I can't understand is why the orange juice companies can't just work out which nutrients they want to market, and put them all in the one beverage. I know I would most certainly opt for the juice that has the added calcium and vitamins in the one drink rather than one that doesn't. It's working on the two-minute noodle principle. If a company started marketing one minute noodles, then  urlLink Maggi  would go out of business.   I'm always on the lookout for a bargain DVD-wise, so I can often be found checking out the stand with the cheap DVD's at K-Mart. Every so often goodies appear there. There has been one DVD sitting there that simply looked god awful. It'd been there for months and I always assumed I knew why. 'Ginger Snaps'.    It looked like a pretty generic straight-to-rental kind of affair, made to cash in on the success of the theatrical success Teen Slasher/horror films that've been raking in the cash over the last few years. I was one of the people that saw Scream in the cinemas and attributed to its huge gross. For that I apologise. Recently I'd read on the Internet (it comes on computers now) that Ginger Snaps was actually a decent flick. I refused to believe it.  urlLink Rottentomatoes.com  gave it an  urlLink 89% Fresh  rating. Somethings not quite right here, but it scored a ton of critical praises. I managed to find a copy after actually having to search for the DVD. Will it be any good? Guess I'll have to watch the damn thing.          "

1657,Aquarius,"             I came across this in my daily readings of Korean news and sites...just trying to get a handle on this place.   urlLink     The anti-traditional Korean lady...holy crap, they look strong!

Maybe because even when muscle-bound Korean women still look relatively dainty--at least compared to their Western-lady body-building counterparts who start to look a little horsey.         "
1658,Aquarius,"       I love the bridges of Richmond.  They are no architectural triumphs by any means.  They are simple and quiet, sometimes elegant, and to me, quite satisfying.    My favorite is the Nickel bridge.  It is a small two lane bridge that is made of intricate iron workings on either side and is lighted by short lamps which are part of the iron work.  It is a quaint bridge and one of the quite one I think.  As cars pass each other in close proximity, it's as if they are quitely saying hello to each other.    The one I take to work everyday, the Powhite Pkwy, is a toll bridge and although I pay everyday and hope that my $.50 will soon make enough of a difference that the tolls will soon go away, I make sure to enjoy the view on either side of me.  On the left is a train bridge that was clearly built when we took time for grandeur and beauty in transportation.  The train bridge is grey stone with slender arches that reach just under the flat top.  Everytime I look at this bridge I imagine riding in a cafe car on a train in the 20s, sipping tea and headed south to somewhere fabulous.  Just visible beyond the train bridge is the Nickel bridge, much shorter than the train bridge and sometimes I think it is a whisper of a bridge in the distance.  Back to the right side of the Powhit bridge.  On the right is only the James river and it's tree lined banks.  The river is a bit rocky at this point and every morning I can gauge the level of percepitation west of Richmond.  When the river is at a normal level, birds perch on some rocks that barely rest above the water level.  The first time I saw I bird sitting on one of these tiny rocks, I wondered if he thought himself a daredevil.   The Hugenot bridge is at the end (or beginning) of Cary St.  It extends into the posh westend of Richmond.  This bridge is two lanes with rails on either side that mimic a picket fince in metalic piping.  But, it's length is what is so fascinating.  It goes for at least a quarter mile and part of is not over water at all.  When you start the bridge from the Cary St. side you enter and curve around into a grove of trees.  Because it's a bridge a this point, you feel as if you are suspended through a small forest.  As you curve around, train tracks appear quickly and then the banks of the of the river.  It's a bit like a fairytale bridge, no exactly magical, but unnexpected.  The Willey Memorial Bridge mimics the Hugenot bridge in length and setting, but is far different in description.  The bridge is all concrete and lit by standard street lights.    The Lee Memorial bridge is my least favorite.  It connets downtown to a area that could be referred to as the 'projects,' a sad and large part of this troubled town.  This bridge is open to pedestrians on either side so that the blank concrete feel is even more guarded by chain link fencing.  Although the bridge is wide with four lanes, you feel boxed in and can't see the water underneath.  The idea and realization of being suspended over rushing water does elevate the drab feel of this bridge for the brief trip over the James.  The 2nd st. bridge is another non-descript bridge, but on the downtown bank there is a memorial to Vietnam veterans of Virginia.  It's a beautiful memorial, a large stone wall in the background, a grand shape of a women inside, behind a glass wall.  I've haven't seen it up close, it's on my list of things to do.  Just the other day I discovered an walking suspension bridge under the 2nd st. bridge.  The walking bridge literally hangs below the towering car bridge above.  It reminds me of the Millineum Bridge in London, another beautiful walking suspension bridge.                   "
1659,Gemini,"           Earlier today I was told that I'm only interested in softcock TV shows. Probably true.  That said, it seems that there are a heck of a lot of TV pilots currenty hitting the Internet at the moment. As a TV nerd with a broadband connection, I feel its my duty to take a look at some of these gems. And non-gems. And by non-gems, I mean anything by Stephen Bochco.  Today I took a gander at the pilot for Mister Sterling. The show isn't new. In fact, I think it was used as a mid-season replacement earlier this year and wasn't picked up for the new season. That said, it still hasn't aired in Australia yet, so I figured I'd take a peek.    What's It About?   Mister Sterling centres on the son of a former senator who is chosen to take over a seat in the senate by a senator who died. So, yes, it's very heavy on the US politics. The show itself could easily be described as what The West Wing would have been like if Aaron Spelling produced it and decided to tone down the sex a little. Mister Sterling was created and produced by  urlLink Lawrence O'Donnell , a former writer on the West Wing. It's a modern day Mister Smith Goes To Washington. The only difference is that Mister Smith goes To Washington never guest starred porn queen Jenna Jameson. Much to its own detriment, I've always felt.    Who's In It?   The cast is filled with a ton of those actors that cause you to spend most of the time trying to work out 'where have I seen that dude before?'. The show is led by  urlLink Josh Brolin , son of Mister Barbara Streisand: James Brolin. While Josh can never follow in his fathers footsteps by appearing in something as great as  urlLink Pensacola: Wings of Gold . Supporting players involve the former TV-version of Jeff Spicoli  urlLink Dean Cameron ,  urlLink Harris Yulin , and former father figure in Boy Meets World  urlLink William Russ .    So, What happens In That Crucial First Episode?   As you'd expect, Mister Sterling comes to Washington. he meets a few of the wrong people, but he's a smart guy under that all-American facade and eventually works out who he can trust. In the pilot, as Sterling settles into his first day, he mistakenly tells a reporter that he doesn't belong to the Democrat party. A problem in that the party hold a very tight position of power in the Senate. Just one more Republican in the senate means that they get to take power. So what does the Republican party do to keep power? They resort to the very thing that makes America great: bribery.    But is It Any Good?   I quite liked it, but then, I quite like The West Wing, which has been accused of being liberal softcock television. In many ways, this is to the West Wing what shows like High Incident, or The District are to something like NYPD Blue. It's a heck of a lot more featherweight in terms of quality, but it does strive high. The cast don't really click properly in the first episode, but they all have potential. It's just a shame that the show aspires to be higher brow than it ever will be.         "

1661,Capricorn,"                 My family and I are really fond of old, classic movies. A few nights ago we all watched  Mr.Smith Goes to Washington . I hadn't seen this before and really enjoyed it. Despite the soppy title, and the fact that it was made in 1939, it is totally relevant to the 21st century. It's about an 'idealistic, small town senator who heads to Washington and suddenly finds himself single-handedly battling ruthless politicians out to destroy him.' (That's the description on the back of the videocase.) Jimmy Stewart excellently plays the main character, Jefferson Smith. He comes to the job of senator without any previous experience to prepare him for the world of politics, and when he discovers the corruption existing there, instead of falling into it himself, he attempts to make others realize who's really running things in the senate. When you look at how much the media and big lobbies, such as Planned Parenthood and teachers' unions, have to do with who gets elected around here, you see that things aren't so different now than they were back then.

1664,Leo,"       I've just checked out the page for the new  Zelda  game and I have to say that I can't wait for it to come out. After the big pile of dog poo that was the Ledgend of the Windwaker I'm so glad that they decided to make the Zelda game that people want, not try to reinvent the series as a cartoon that you play.   At first, when looking at the screenshots, I was a little confused. I thought 'Hey, these are screenshots of 'A link to the past''. Then I realized that there wern't four Links in that game. However this game does indeed use many of the same graphics that were used in 'Link to the Past'. Hopefully it will also include the dark world and stuff, though this game looks prettty triforce free. Well, I guess you can't have everything, even though I really really would like to have the Triforce of wisdom....hint hint...   Oh yeah, stuff has happened in my life since yesterday, but it hardly seems worth talking about considering this Zelda news.   UPDATE: I have learned that there is another Zelda game  in the works . This one is 3D and looks like it will give little kinds and grown-ups alike nightmares that will put them off sleep for days. Just check out the screenshots, the one with Link fighting the GIANT ASS DEMON looked scarey as hell. I saw that guy and figured it had to be all over for Link, I really don't see how the little guy can pull off a victory aginst what looks like a 5 story building of a demon. Ohh man, I can't wait for this shit.....I wish I could freeze myself in carbonite or something untill this shit comes out.         "
1665,Scorpio,"              I feel it in my fingers...I feel it in my toes...  So sings glam-rock bad-boy has-been 'Billy Mack' in the opening sequence of 'Love Actually'.  And he sings it so, so well - the ol' geezer, gyrating to the rhythm. But he's not the only one to gyrate (or vibrate, or translate, or prostrate) in the movie, no. For 'tis the season to be jolly, and Love, Actually, packs a punch!  The movie was hilarious! Tho' the plot intricately weaving through various (love)-lives was predictably naff, understated British humour never ceases to make me laugh till my belly aches. I'd expect nothing less from Richard Curtis, the man who brought us Bridget Jones' Diary, Mr Bean, and the Black Adder series. (And yes, Rowan Atkinson does make a couple appearances).  Truth be told, the movie should really be titled 'Lust Actually', or 'Luff Actually'. It charts the fluff-luff lives of several characters in present-day Christmas season London. It's love-at-first-sight. Or love-and-sex-at-second-sight. And where it comes close to the true meaning of Love -  choosing  to love, each day, again and again, despite mistakes and close encounters with infidelity - it shies away, preferring to gloss over its painful reality in favour of the 'sweet pure agony of being  in  love'.  One of the perks the movie offers is the fact that you'd recognise most of the faces in the movie, including Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth (Bridget Jones'), Alan Rickman (the bad dude in Harry Potter), Kiera Knightley (Bend it like Beckham, Pirates of the Caribbean) and Hugh Grant as  (can you believe it?)  the British Prime Minister!!   Like i said, it was hilarious!  (Although I must say, Mr Four-Weddings-and-a-Funeral can still charm the ladies with his foppish yet debonair ways...)  Look out for the cameos!          "
1666,Capricorn,"           U know Diablo every person has a aura (I mean the one that is seen around the head of great people)  Now only children see this aura and when u grow up will not be able to see it. There are many techniques to again learn how to see aura (I wont go into it) Now the aura will be good and to look only if u r a good person and have not done any sins and if u r bad person u r aura becomes bad a terrifying with increase in sins So u might have seen small children cry when they see some people and smile sometimes and neutral some other times and that says how is u r aura  U know Diablo some time children cry when they see me(just joking) Guess we can change name. U Baba me Diablo   This weekend sucked big time. It rained whole week and we could not go out and nerdy (mudgal) gave hath after raising hope, to top it all   Some times I sit by the window and gaze at the rain, no though pass me.strange i have become numb   Hay gouds is have used this PDF thing I used iText api/jar, its a song to use it, but it takes time for comlex pdf            "
1667,Capricorn,"                 It's started to get hot. It wasn't hot today, but yesterday was relatively sweltering. When it starts to get hot, my mind naturally drifts to the movie.... Breaking Away ! (of course you could say the some thing about  Laurence of Arabia )Sometimes it reminds me of summer here. It's not as hot, but the stuck-in-the-most- boring-town-in-the-history-of-the-universe type of feeling sort of gets through to me. The trudging around the center of town on a humid day reminds me much of my summer last year. But that's not the best part of this movie. That's just what makes it appealing at the moment. It's odd, because some of my favorite movies are about sports, and I'm the most unathletic person ever. I also have absolutely no interest in sports whatsoever. But in movies like  Breaking Away  and  Chariots of Fire  it's the characters, ideas and themes that really have me captured.       "
1668,Sagittarius,"        Gifts of the internet  I received an email from my sister this morning.    'A friend of mine wrote this but doesn't think it's any good and she thinks my opinion is biased cause we're friends so I asked if she minded if I sent it to you. Let me know what you think of it please! Love you!!!!'     No trust Deep pain Great Fear No Gain   I'm scarred I'm scared My past left me impaired   How to know she tells the truth I inch forward very slow I want to believe that she'll be there But how am I to know   I listen close to every word Does she have some secret plan But when I look into her eyes She reaches out her hand                           ~Anonymous   I'm going to write her back and tell her I like it.  But, I was so touched by the sentiment, the fear that so many of us experience but aren't able to put into words, that I felt impelled to share it.  Hope the writer doesn't mind.  What do you think of it?  Oh, and don't forget to check your Monday morning horoscope over at Frenchy's blog.  I'm going there now.  Diva out.          "

1670,Aquarius,"                 I love Saturdays! Ked worked on some freelance jobs off and on all day long, and I just hung around. I have these days every now and then when I'm restless. Nothing sounds interesting to do and so I flit from activity to activity not really accomplishing anything nor having the mental focus to accomplish anything if I tried. Today was one of those days!  Jason called last night and it was good to catch up with him. Ked and I continually count our blessings when it comes to our siblings and their other halves. It's one thing to have good relationships with all our siblings. It's quite another thing to consider them  great friends  and people we want to hang out with and live our lives with. We are truly blessed.  Speaking of blessed with good friendships, the Falcon has given me the code name of Gladriel on his blog (nxgnn8). He says we should all understand where our code names came from, but this is a complete mystery to me. The thought of being a tall, slender, blonde elf is quite appealing though! Or maybe he chose it realizing what a graceful and qualified leader I am. HA!! Anywho, we are continually thankful for the friendship there, as well as with all our friends across the country. It's most delightful to look over the map of our lives and recognize that were it not for a pitt stop or a detour here and there we might not have some of the most precious friendships in our lives. It may be through a chance meeting (like Chancel camp freshman year at CU, I miss you Jennifer!), or through the friendship of our parents and their common hobbies (where are you Karen, I miss you too!), or a lifetime bond begun in kindergarten Sunday School (I can't wait to see you in July, Shelley!), but there is no doubt that the golden threads of friendship woven into my life enrich the beauty of life on this earth. No matter the time and distance that separates us, you are precious gems.  In blogging news, Ked helped me add a comments section to my blog! You can now post a reply, comment or thought to my posts! So, we are still looking for ideas for a tv show to produce for Public Access (see my previous post). If you have any suggestions, post a reply! Ked's coworker Brian thought we could do a David Blaine spoof. With Ked growing his hair out long, Brian says Ked looks like a magician and thought we could go around the University campus and do magic tricks. Oh my.               "
1671,Aquarius,        D.S.T.   hey kids! don't forget to set your clocks back one hour! weeeee doggies! i'll take an extra hour anytime!         
1672,Leo,"                 We received an email a few days ago from one of the deans here on campus.  Here's an excerpt:   Dear students:  I hope that no one needs to use this policy, but it is there if the worst occurs.  Policy: Any request, or other relief regarding examinations, that may involve retaking an examination based upon a claim of physical, mental or emotional illness or  distress  at the time of taking the original examination (from which relief is sought) must be made before the commencement of such examination or at such other time as may be permitted under extraordinary circumstances, but in no event later than the date the examination grade is posted.   I found this to be interesting--the fact that law school exams can be so stressful that a school has a policy set in case someone becomes so out of their mind they cannot take the exam.  Now, I realize how much we have riding on these tests--the entire grade is based upon one test; our first year grades are the most important in finding our second year summer associate posistion (and ultimately a permanent position); selection for Law Review is based upon first year grades--you get the point...but does anyone ever really freak out so much it becomes physically impossible for them to take an exam?    Maybe there is something wrong with me (and the majority of my friends).  I haven't encountered anyone (yet) who is incredibly stressed out.  Here I am, in Boca Grande at the beach--yeah, I'm studying but I'm not holed up in the library 24/7 (which is impossible since it's only open until 12).  I justified my driving time by listening to the  Sum & Substance Criminal Law CDs , which are read by the author of my book (Dressler) and are pretty damn good.  Granted I get a little distracted at times by scenery, other cars, or my own random thoughts, but I still feel like I'm being productive.  I went to bed around midnight last night and slept for 8 hours.  Maybe I'm too relaxed, I don't know.  I guess I'll find out when I get my grades.  Luckily, if I learn that I need to be a little more uptight to get better grades I can change my outlook while I only have two grades riding on an exam week instead of five.  I suppose now I should quit musing about my lack of stress in studying for exams and start actually studying, as to prevent the possibility of an impending freak out.  :)  I'll post more later.

1673,Aries,"           It would be nice if from an emissions standpoint, the SUV was classified as a truck instead of a car.  I mean, after all, it really is a truck.  That's really my only beef.         "

1675,Taurus,"           I hate my Ipod,  urlLink Om Malik explains why .  This is one of *many* problems I've had with this thing.  The bag over the head and punch in the face (as Clark Griswold would say) is that there'e literally NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE on the market.  Rio's tank, and don't have the UI of the ipod, and Sony's new gem only plays their proprietary ATRAC format, which I'm very wary of.  Sucks being an 'early adopter'.         "

1680,Taurus,             The start of the day wasnt so bad i woke up at 12:05 watched tv for a while then went outside to mow the grass with my mom but as u know in my family when everything is going good somthing bad is about to happen and it did. when i was working on the front yard i heard this big crash and my mom came running saying she busted her head open blood was gushing everywhere and i told her to apply pressure to the wound. i learned this in football when some asshole cleated me horribly but there' s no scar thank god. my mom didnt want me to go with her to the hospital instead she wanted me to stay here and finish the lawn. i agreed and did just that. i know how she feels and its not good. hopefully this WILL NOT happen again. i just found out my mom is going to be okay thank god. well&nbsp; i have to clean up all the fuckin blood in the bathroom so peace!          
1681,Cancer,"       Hey, all. Jesus Christ I am the worst person in blog maintenance history.  I just finished watching  Save the Last Dance , which is, seriously, now one of the (my) best movies of all time. A white girl goes to New York and learns dancing from a black guy. Whilst doing so, they fall in love. Damn wonderful, and a superb anti-racism movie. And every scrap of dancing in that movie is beautiful. I should like to state, Sean Patrick Thomas is one of the coolest (is that cool to say anymore? cool?) guys (black or white) that I have seen, and Julia Stiles is so graceful and beautiful and I think I might worship her and ask her for divine dancing ability. God knows I need it. Well, maybe God doesn't know, but I know I need it. Anyone who has seen me dance knows. (Jessica, of the Rotary Council, knows. Sigh...passed opportunities).  Someone teach me to dance.  AP English exam from hell passed Monday, which is, incidentally, a very good thing. I'm aiming for a three. Thus, if I recieve higher, I shall be pleasantly surprised. Let's see what's next - Biology exam. On Monday. Damn. I shall be studying Sunday for that bloody thing. Especially all the 'design an experiment' shit. But the rest, I can handle fairly well.  I am pretty sure that my fatigue is bettering (is that a word?). It may be from lessening the medicine from 20 to 15 mm. Or it may be from eating protein bars. Either way, I am staying awake in Biology somewhat better. Senioritis is beginning to sap my strength. Goddamnitall. I want summer.  This actually sounds rather odd, but I am beginning to want to work this summer. And not necessarily for money, just as somewhat of a daily purpose. I don't want an easy job. I strangely want to work as a waiter, or something in that category. I mean, though I want money, I don't want it to be so easy to access that it becomes monotonous. And I don't want to mow yards. Not my class of work, personally, despite the loads of cash that might flow in. Davis-Kidd or Folks Folly sounds extremely appealing.  This is actually a rather long post compared to recent blogging.  We have some stuff coming on up in English that will be time consuming. But beyond that, the weeks until school tapers off appear somewhat clean. Let's just pass the damn exams and go to sleep. I'm ready to start working as an intern geneticist.  Cheers, mortals. Let the words of wrong become the gestures of right. (What the hell did that mean?)    "
1682,Leo,"            Must....play....the....sims.....   I just had a thought. Yup. All by myself. A whole thought. Oh.... you wanna hear it? Oh, ok. So, I was thinking that if some evil overlord wanted to take over the U.S., he should just buy enough computers for everybody and install the sims on every one of them. Seriously, once that was done, we'd all be addicted and mr. evil overlord could just walk into the white house and declare himself king of the United States. What I find interesting is that the sims is incredibly addictive, but it is essentially a  life simulator . I mean, people are playing this game for hours and hours, pretending to interact with their families and friends, instead of ACTUALLY interacting with their families and friends. Do we suck that bad? Are we as a people just so boring and idiotic that we'd rather play with a virtual family instead of a real one? of course, when your real family pisses you off, you can't wall them into a bedroom until they die...... or can you? I've seen houses uploaded on various websites with the description 'this is my house'. People are simulating their homes in a simulation of their lives while they sit in their real homes missing their real lives. Am I the only one who sees the gargantuan steaming piles of irony here? And there is another problem - even worse than the sims: When I mentioned the evil overlord, I said 'he', and I bet nobody noticed. if I'd have said 'she', everybody would have been upset because I'm a sexist. and it doesn't even occur to you that there could be female evil overlords... hell, look at cruella de vil, or the wicked witch of the west. What I'm really trying to say is.... hey look - it's my sims cd.... so nice and shiny..... I could probably just play for a little while. yeah, that'd be alright. Just a while......         "

1684,Aquarius,"              urlLink     Paris Lovers...what a happy couple.   Looking at Korea one can see something of a Leave it to Beaver mindset when it comes to relationships--especially in the minds of 20-something girls here.  One could compare it (as I will) to a monk living life in a temple and then having everything changed when he starts to see what happens over the hills where he makes his home.    Thankfully, some movies are starting to show that life may not be what we assume.  Recently I watched  urlLink Hi, Dharma!  ( urlLink a story about a gang of criminals that hides out in a monastery ) and  urlLink In-eo Gong-ju  (literally means mermaid princess, but is translated to My Mother the Mermaid or Little Mermaid; a story about a daughter who somehow visits her parents when they first meet and fall in love).  Dharma is a comedy where the gangsters find out something about themselves within the (relative) purity of the monks and the monks gain a new perspective from their dichotic encounters.  Both learned that their so-called 'pure' states (of peace or brutality) are not perfect and they can grow from knowing one another.   The daughter in Mermaid had a revelation as well.  She hated her parents (her father seemed a dim-witted postal worker and her mother a cussing rubber/masseuse at a bathhouse).  She wished she were an orphan like her boyfriend.  An odd occurrence (I still don't know how this happened) put her back in time to when her parents met on  urlLink Jeju-do  where her mother was a diver (mermaid connection) and her father a postman.  She comes to see them in their innocence and pure state--full of dreams and potential; not the broken and bitter people they became.  A picture taken at that time shows the village in and around their first bus and her young father on his bicycle, smiling.  The daughter asks her mother why he is smiling...and in the last scene her mother says, 'Of course he is smiling, what else could he be doing?' (or words to that effect).  Yes, the young have every reason to smile.   urlLink     My Mother the Mermaid and Hi, Dharma!   Mermaid seems to show that the 'pure' state of youth and promise is a transient one and Dharma could be saying that moving from purity may actually be good (adding another dimension for growth).  This is something that some young people here don't seem to grasp...they need to have perfect grades to get into the perfect university and get the perfect job and marry the perfect spouse and have the perfect family (which means grandsons for many parents and in-laws).  Perhaps in the future less emphasis will be placed on keeping up with the Kims/Joneses but for now many still aspire to a pure and perfect dreamlife.  Of course, if they don't marry the perfect person Koreans can now  urlLink get a divorce  quite easily...which is another problem.         "
1685,Scorpio,"             Ok... Here's the comments on the teams that I bring every reality show I watch. That is if we here at Singapore aren't too behind... I titled the post perky underdogs cause the underdogs seem to really be having fun on the race! Go the underdogs! Here's the whatever I promised stuff...  Brandon & Nicole -- I said last week that much was expected of this team, but they underperformed last leg. This leg, however, was a totally different story. They showed no negative signs, no whining, and no complaining. Nicole, however, may be a little too inactive for my liking. Poor her getting shagged in a foreign country, and all her boyfriend did was look for his balls(pun!). Bad Boy... They got a little lucky with the cemeterys, having their taxi driver correct them...  Charla & Mirna -- GOGOGOGO the little one! I love you Charla! She absolutely rocked the episode with her punk dancing, her ballerina twirling and her 'stick your hand up the cow's behind' comment. It wasn't exactly fair that they got on the common ferry, but who cares right? It does make up for her inability to run, and she paid for it again at the foot race to the pit-stop. All I'm afraid of is that Mirna will feel like she's doing everything for the team, which is so untrue. I think Charla helped more with the slab of beef in the first leg. Nicole & Brandon are getting along well with them, so maybe, hopefully, the mentioned alliance next week is them. Then Brandon can carry Charla during a foot race! Ahh... I sense the first working Amazing Race alliance even before I see it! And did you see Mirna's face when she hugged Phil? Hilarious!  Jim & Marsha -- Wowzer! This team shocked me with their 3rd place finish. Who would expect the weakest team last leg to come out so strong this leg. Victims of the bowling moms? LOSERS! Ok... it was really bad of the moms to play so dirty, but who would believe that a middle class country like Argentina doesn't accept US currency? Even we in Singapore accept US currency! I really like it, however, that they finished in front of those moms. Rub it in their faces people!  Linda & Karen -- Who would expect the moms to be such home-bred bitches? Firstly, they've not heard of a foam party... Superbly stupid... And then they, like those bloody cowards in class, bully those weaker than them. How low can you go? I really, honestly, hope that these 2 go down next week. Who knows? we may get to see Charla jumping on her trampoline tummy... Btw, I thought the 'You outsmarted a cow' comment was serious on their part. And I still don't know which is Linda and which is Karen...  Marshall & Lance -- Who? What? Where? After a fluke showing on the first leg of the race, this team proved that they teams cannot be judged on just 1 leg of the race. They are so insignificant because they are humourless and entirely serious. Who was it claiming to be the Ken & Gerard of the race again? This team needs to go soon... They are of no interest to us viewers.  Bob & Joyce -- Really, really horrible leg for these 2, and they still managed to stay in. First, the wrong cemetery... A little luck was involved of course, but they could have simply told the driver Evita Peron and he would've known where to go. No... I have to speak in their native style... Chacarita! Chacarita your way home soon people! Oops... Sorry if I just cursed you... Anyway, really bad call with the detour. Just because you like dogs doesn't mean the dogs are easier. Matching the face is much easier than walking one mile!  Colin & Christie -- Same comments as last week. This team definitely has chemistry together, and a lot is expected of them. However, they have failed to show us any of their outstanding abilities. I really wouldn't be surprised seeing these 2 eliminated the next time. I wouldn't be too upset either! They're getting monotonous and are sinking into the depths of Marshall & Lance's oblivion. If they don't show well the next time, I will have absolutely nothing left to say...  Chip & Kim -- Chip's a bastard. Need I say more? Yes I do! They sank as low as the bowling moms this time, playing it absolutely dirty. I have to say though, the stand off in the cab was a very smart tactical move, and it was absolute fairplay, even though some might not admit it. I'm sure that everyone rather him be nicer and let the bloody taxi go. Well these 2 have got to take a taxi and go home soon, cause I have a feeling next episode Chip will show more of his torrid qualities that I will surely hate.  Kami & Karli -- Poor little babes got stood up by that bloody Chip. Really respectable that they managed to finish the dog walking task even though they hated dogs. Maybe it's because they're so catty... There seems to be a significant twist in the detours this season; one is much easier than the other. They're enemity with Chip & Kim will push them to use the 'Yield' next episode... I hope! These 2 teams will continue to battle for the last team in, I can feel it.  Alison & Donny -- What a bummer. Donny's a strong guy, but maybe he's too dimwitted. Alison's a weak girl, but she's smart. These 2 make a really dynamic duo, but queerly they were booted so early. Alison confirmed she's a bitch by walking away so defiantly from her partner after getting eliminated.           "

1688,Capricorn,"           Hey people,  I just got a mail from Beatrice and she wantes to join the writers team so this is getting to be a pretty big group, Im also talking to Constance right now and our negotiations are going well.  My new years was pretty good I spent the begining of the evening with my family but after midnight I went to another town close by (an hour driving) where my best friend lives, we started drinking at his place and then moved on to one of his friends where there were alot of young but pretty girls, which I consider to be a good thing. I kissed to many girls in my opinion but who gets enough of kissing? The night ended on a couch at my friends place and I wasnt alone;)  The day after we went to see Lord of the Rings in a VIP room (if you dont know what that is then its like a regular movie theater where you pay double the entrance but sit in a Lazy Boy and get all the pop corn and all the coke you can drink). I definatly think the VIP thing was worth it coz the movie is almost 4 hours, we went at midnight and came out short before 4.   On Saturday I went to my cousins wedding and I had the job of being her photographer which is harder than it sounds for example I was trying to take a picture of the wedding waltz I took like 7 pictures but all I got was their backs ( the camera is rather slow).  Later me and some of my cousins went down town where I got phone numbers of two girls one I realy like but the number of the other one Im gonna lose. Actually I just came few hours ago from our first date it was pretty nice but I dont know if it will work out.   Thats enough of my life, Ingi/Úlli         "
1689,Aquarius,"        When We Were in 8th Grade...   last night i drove to sylmar to pick up my sister and some of her friends. tin's classmate, rodney,  had just turned 14 years old (Good God!) and he invited some friends to come over for an after-school partay. i got to the gated community at about 7:15 (cuz tin told me to get them at 7 pm) and was greeted by rodney's mom, mrs. bravo (who used to be a 1st grade teacher at st. francis when i was still there). all the kids were swimming and the oh-so familiar 'aaaw man, we're leaving?' came out of my sister and her friends' mouths when they saw me. well, i offered to pick them up later but one of her friends had to be home by 8 so we needed to motor. so the kids went back to the house and got dressed while i waited patiently in the family room talking to mrs. bravo and eating fruit salad. she was like, 'so where are you going to school now?' after i answered, 'oh, i've been done for 3 years,' she let out this 'YOU ARE? OH MY GOD HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?' the last time she knew for sure i was still in school was when she was a teacher's aid and i was an 8TH GRADER!  GOD REMEMBER WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO BE AN 8TH GRADER? to be at the highest post in elementary hierarchy? the ones all the younger kids wanted to hang out with? life was just so much simpler then, with not much to worry about except the beginning stages of adolescence when you're starting to figure out what kind of friends you want to have and how you want them to define you, and then looking forward to passing a high school entrance exam and eventually graduating to begin again at a new school! and OH THE DREAMS we dreamt for our lives in the future, which seemed so far away, felt far more reachable back then than they do now.   just listening to my sister and her 3 friends' conversation in the car was enough to bring me back 11 years. tin and her best friend, josephine, were talking about something girly, while the two boys, raneil (who's sitting shotgun) and j.j. are discussing how they wanna find summer jobs after graduation. raneil's like, 'why do you wanna work at KFC for? how much do you think you're gonna get paid?' and j.j. shoots back with, 'raneil, man, if i work full-time that's like $250 a week!!!' i remember when i worked at universal studios after high school and $178 a week (net) brought the greatest joy to my life!!! and then they go on to discuss which high schools they wanna attend and why, which leads to living on their own when high school is done. UY! they both just sounded so sure of their plans. this is what i want to happen and that's that. it made me laugh to remember how we used to talk this way about our futures; 'after high school, i'll be in college majoring in chemical engineering, and then after graduation i'll work for NASA , and then i can get married.' that would mean i would've been married...last year. but THAT'S how i used to think and i know a lot of us had the same kind of vision about our lives.  and here we all are, 12 years after elementary school. this isn't exactly what i envisioned i would be in a dozen year's time but i think i've accepted the fact that things don't always turn out the way you plan them. i'm still waiting (more like hoping) for a lot of things to happen to me and God-willing, i'll be a lot more satisfied with myself in a few years. until then, the dreaming and the visions don't cease. here's to another 12 years to wait and see...

1692,Aries,           we are not worthy to know - too much.         
1693,Sagittarius,"        It's been a little longer than I had wanted between postings, but I have 2 good reasons for that. First off, my interent access has been spotty lately. I have loaded several spyware and virus checkers, as well as switch browsers from IE to Firefox, so hopefully that will help. And secondly, the wife and I have adpoted a dog. Her name is Jessie, she's a Jack Russell Terrier. We got her at the Franklin County Dog Shelter this past Sunday. She's had a rough past and is pretty timid, but is settling into her new surroundings well (with a few accidents...)  Anyway, I went to that show. Big-ups to my man DGrove for hooking us up with primo seats. It was a cool show- as I said earlier, I hadn't heard much of Guster or Rufus Wainwright, but I dug both of them. Guster was cool- good harmonies, good lyrics, nice feel. I was pretty blow away by Rufus. He has a killer voice and a real style onstage. He covered Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah', and I don't think anybody's written a better song than that. Just killer.  As for Ben Folds, man, I think he's great. Great stage presence, great songs, fun show. For those of you that have heard his Live CD, he did the singalongs from that, as well as the minor-key-dramatic version of the 'Song for the Dumped'. He played 3 songs from his 2 recent EP's, including   a more up-tempo version of 'Give Judy My Notice', with Guster backing him up. The highlight of his show were 2 new songs, both of which were pretty mellow. One was a song for his daughter, a companion piece to 'Still Fighting It' of the    Rocking the Suburbs   record, and the other was a tribute to Elliot Smith. Man, I just about lost it on that one. I have a lot of friends who kinda gave up on Ben after BF5 broke up, and I respectfully think those people should reconsider.  Anyway, gonna try to get to the record store this weekend to pick up the new Wilco record, so I can see if it is as disappointing as everyone says it is. Also gonna try to track down the new Hayden CD. If you don't know Hayden, do so. I swear, he's fucking Canadian Jesus.  And don't forget about the poll question.          "

Who sees her good little kid being sucked in by 'the wrong crowd.'  and of course its supposed to reinforce all of her ideas about who the wrong crowd is, what they do, and what the destiny of her good little grandkid will be.  My grandmother used to take great delight -- secret-agent-identity-delight -- in covertly leaving these books everywhere.  It added a great deal of drama.  Of course she also passed them out by hand to everyone she met.    My grandmother was a bright, educated thoughtful person.  She read the classics, knew great art, had impeccable taste.  So why jack chick?   Fundamentalism baffles me more the further I get from it.  Which, I suppose, is the point.    "

1697,Pisces,"       So I was in the same bathroom as mentioned in the first posting, and noticed that someone had creatively edited the grafiti that said 'the Lord is strong here' into saying 'the ODOR is strong here.'

Speaking of honesty, for those of  you that Tony hasn't already told, I compromised my code of ethics the other day outside of Paul Brown Stadium.

I left Vics at 3:30pm and started Roger's at 4pm. At Rogers, I was asked to come and do a full fucking shift. Gah! So I came home at 3:35 and then changed into Rogers garb.

1705,Leo,"                 Here I am, 8-something a.m. on Sunday, wishing I was still asleep.  If my wonderful, sweetheart of a non-sleeping dog would've shut up instead of insisting I got up to take him out I would still be sleeping.  But anyway, I don't really feel like starting on my reading yet (even though I spent all day yesterday reading and still have a ridiculous amount left), so I thought this would be a good time to reflect on my first month of law school.  This will probably be another marathon post, so buckle up.  We are two days shy of it being one month since we started Orientation.  In a way it's gone by really quickly, like a blur.  But on the other hand, I feel like I've been in law school for much longer, which probably has a lot to do with the fact it's a summer session and we've covered almost 3/4 of a 14 week regular semester's worth of material in 4. What I can say for sure though is I definitely feel like I've known my classmates for more than a month.  I flipped open my cell phone yesterday afternoon and noticed that the last four people I'd talked to were people I didn't even know before this thing started.  If I feel like I know them all so well now I can't even imagine what it will be like after the spring.  The way law school (generally) works is that you are with your section of classmates your entire 1L year.  That means not only do we have every class together now, but we will this fall and next spring as well.  Actually, we will be split up into smaller groups for Research & Writing, but they will still be groups of only our class.  It's a lot like going back to elementary school.  We don't get to choose our classes, our professors, or even our class times.  We just log on to the computer (not-so-much like elementary I guess), view whatever schedule the registrar decided to give us, and show up to class.     Now this has the potential to be either really good or really bad--I actually think in some ways it will be both.  For the most part, I am quite happy with the people I've met.  They are smart, interesting, and fun.  However, being stuck in a class every day for an entire year with a handful of them will be just about as fun as cleaning a toilet or putting together a lawnmower (see the May archives).  I just can't see myself growing to like people who snicker when someone says the wrong thing or immediately begin flailing their arm in hopes the prof will let them correct their classmate or talk just to hear themselves talk.  It's great that you know the answer, but at least wait until the prof asks for someone else's opinion.  We are all in the same boat--get over yourselves!  You don't make yourself look cooler or smarter than that person you felt the need to belittle with your snickers or hand flailing.  I'm really hoping the rumors about the quiet people in the back row ending up with 3.75+ are true; and that the know-it-alls will see that their incessant ramblings amounted to a 2.0.  Actually, hopefully the quiet people (person) in the center of the third row will be the ones with 3.75s.  :)  The day grades come out will probably pretty shocking for a lot of people, myself included.  I'm not sure how often anything over a 3.5 happens in law school--not too much here at Stetson I don't think.  One person graduated summa cum laude last spring, and I've been told she was the first in almost 10 years or something outrageous like that.  Now receiving something less than a 3.5 certainly won't be shocking to me because I've never received a low GPA (there's always that 1.75 my first semester at UF), but I've definitely never put in this much work and received a low GPA.  Actually, I've never put in this much work period.  I've gotten plenty of 3.5+ semester GPAs and not put in a fraction of the work I do now.  To make matters worse, we aren't even ranked this summer so that 2.5, 2.75, whatever I get will mean virtually nothing since I won't know if that puts me in the bottom or the top of the class.  They've made some new change to the grading scale that the classes before us are pissed about (they moved the class average to a minimum 2.9 I think), so I guess that will be some kind of guideline.  Who knows.  Another thing I want to mention is how often my feelings about school seem to fluctuate.  I know that coming in here, and right after Orientation I was scared to death I wasn't going to be able to cut it.  It all seemed so intimidating and everyone seemed so smart.  Then my second week I was more confident about myself and my potential.  Now, pretty regularly, I seem to either feel really good about the way things are going, or really bad.  The added pressure of staying in the top third for scholarship purposes doesn't help much either.  The workload is crazy.  Even when you keep up with all of the reading (which is a task in itself) there is always something else I could be doing (and feel like everyone else is doing).  I could be outlining, or reading study guides, or making flashcards, or meeting with a Deans Fellow--always something.  I suppose it won't stop until 2 p.m. on July 15 when I turn in my 48-hour take home Torts exam.    I'm not sure that this post accomplished what I intended, but I know I wrote an awful lot so hopefully there's must be something useful in here.  I hope so.  Gotta run for now...the dog is calling again.               "

1708,Libra,"       Hey folks. This is a special entry, cuz Im writing from my Aunt Kathy's house. Yesterday was so long and boring I don't even know where to start.  I ended up waking up at like 6:30 yesterday, and went to track at like 10. The meet was at Mineral Ridge. We were there until seven freaking oh clock.  Not to mention I also look like a freak, since harry injured my eye with the fake sword, and I got so sunburnt that I hurt. I really need to do some filming. I only have three days left to get my video done. Now, I really feel like a director. Seriously.  I want to watch the first season of Red vs. Blue. But. I've been so freaking busy it's not even funny.  I can't belive school is almost over. We only have like less than two months left. To me, that's both sad and great at the same time. I definitly cannot wait until I graduate. That way I can leave and move to New York City. If anyone else would like to tag along with me let me know.  I honestly dont know if I want to go to California. I mean, I do. I think it would be really fun. But I dont know. I know that I need to be alone and on my own for a while.  I don't see where that would differ from now. I mean, I'm honestly like never home anymore. I'm usually always either, at School, Track, or I'm at Harry's.  And usually if I am at home, the guys  always end up stopping over or something.  My mom thinks that its odd that I only have a few friends that are girls.  I don't know why I don't. I mean, yeah, there nice to talk to and all, but I barley have anything in common with any of them. The only girls Im really friends with are Rachel and Sarah. Well, there are others, but I don't ever talk to them or hang out with them outside of school. I wonder why they took off the show, where in the world is Carmen San Diego? I don't get that. I get to have pop now. But really, I don't  want it. I just don't.  It tastes really funny and I don't feel to good after it.  You all need to go listen to Muse. I love this band. There really awesome. I mean so awesomerific that I can't even hand gesture it enough to you!  If anyone has any tips on how to woo someone, let me know. I need them desperatly. Yes, that's right folks. I said desperatly.  Well, Im going to skidattle, because this internet is really gay (I love you dsl!) and I gotta get ready to go home.  Always.    "
1709,Taurus,"           Today was day #3 of the computers being down.  No file servers, no print servers, no work - for THREE DAYS.  My co-workers are the biggest bunch of slackers - I think they spent the last couple days just shooting the shit in the hallways.  Personally, I was taking the chance to re-organize and train analysts.  Management was 500% pissed off at everyone just sitting around not doing anything, and even AFTER they came by and bitched people out for not working, as soon as they left, people just went back to what they were chatting about, like nothing happened.

1713,Cancer,"             an incredbly nice action game which i really enjoyed playing. the game cutscenes are the same as the movie with the best quality i have ever seen.  the story is also the same as the bookes and the movies but the makers tried to make it a little bit more difficult.so they changed some parts of the story. the characters are really well made and their movements styles are individual. in an interview inside the game(one of the feautures that you can unlock inside the game after finishing every level) sean astin(sam) mentioned that the character of sam is quiet soft and kind and ofcourse very couragous for those he likes but in the game some of these personalities have been ommited.for example sam fights like a great warrior and even in some opportunities he kills his enemies very badly.at the end i have to say some of the last levels of the game are definitly very hard so you would have some trouble finishing the game. if you want to enjoy the game, i recommand you to have tese system requirements: VGA:G-force 3 or higher or ATI Radeon 8500 or higher with 64 MB RAM on it CPU:Intel 1500 or higher RAM:256 MB or higher by any chance these are not the minimum system requirements but they are only what i friendly recommand you to have to enjoy the action in the game.

1715,Pisces,"       some people are offended when i say that i don't watch adam sandler movies or jim carrey movies.  i've undergone several phases of thinking regarding the usefulness and value of these texts -- so thought i'd put some of my thoughts into the blogosphere for some reflection.  the free dictionary dot com offers this definition of a:   mug - the human face (`kisser' and `smiler' and `mug' are informal terms for `face' and `phiz' is British)  so mugging -- would be -- really using the face for some use, right?   and that seems, in my opinion to be mostly what Jim Carrey & Adam Sandler (the cultural products, not the people or the actors) are about.  They both have the ability to MUG in inspired ways.    Hilarious ways.  When they use their face (or bodies) to perfection -- these guys are VERY very funny.   So why don't I watch their movies?    For me its always been a sort of dis-ease about the ways that MUGGING does not serve the story that they're telling.    I liked both of these guys in sketch comedy shows -- and IF i watch a portion of either of their movies -- I laugh.  Hard.   But then, if i happen to try to watch a WHOLE story -- I don't.  I groan.  I grow weary.  I turn them off.  Because it seems like (in most cases) the story becomes incidental to the punchline of their gloriously funny faces.    Like the story is the setup and their FACE is the punchline.   I used to say that I didn't like them because they weren't acting.  I still think that this particular STYLE of 'acting' while it doesn't at all serve the story (or their 'character' within the story) -- it also probably isn't who THEY are -- so it probably is a kind of performance -- 'acting' might be an appropriate name.   But ultimately, I don't think there's anything BAD about what they're up to.  I think it just belongs in sketch comedy shows.  Not in movies.   Even the GOOD stories that some of their movies started out as -- are -- it seems -- ill served by this MUGGING.  Mugging does, now, however, serve up juicy 'quotes' -- which end up getting bantered about in social groups -- weaving a textual fabric of continuity around most social networks like a warm media blanket.   Not that there's anything wrong with that.  In fact, it seems like a really great side benefit.  Clearly the biggestt and most central benefit to this kind of punchline-driven approach to character or story -- is that each MUG -- each quotable bit -- each hilarious gesture -- memorable line -- BECOMES a kind of an advertisement that is ongoing for the franchise which is --   Adam Sandler.   or   Jim Carrey.  which is why, I suppose that these movies are considered 'vehicles' for their stars....but what gets eroded in a world where most people JUST see these movies INSTEAD of movies with more subtle humor -- which reward the patience and attention of a faithful audience is --   story.   and particularly comic story.   Kenneth Burke calls the Comic Frame -- 'equipment for living.'  and unless we can weave a comic perspective back into our understanding of WHOLE characters -- and broad sequential and consequential sweeps of human action --   we lose valuable equipment for living.   i'm not the culture snob i once was who sneered at these movies or anyone who watched them -- but i want to remind people that they're just watching sketch comedy when they engage these films.  And that, while sketch comedy is a VALUABLE way to start building our comic frames -- its insufficient to build hearty structures which will allow us to the see the world more truly.   i'm eight minutes past the ten minute post rule.  So that means you're asleep.  Not reading anymore.    But if you are awake, I'd love to be engaged on this topic...  peace~  ** in a technology-gaffe-deletion -- Gary makes the worthwhile contribution that *Punch Drunk Love* & *Eternal Happiness* are worthwhile exceptions.

1716,Pisces,"       nathan, who understood my lectures better than most students, (probably because he was subjected to more of them) shared debate trips with me, made me laugh often, despite his claims to being 'a wet blanket,' regularly challenged me to think harder about ideas, and who also just happened to (like me) be a part of a group of family singers in his childhood, was united in holy matrimony with shannon.  nathan, it just occured to me that i don't know whether the clifton family singers wore matching outfits like the Rudd family singers.  we always pulled a metal chair up next to the microphone so my two brothers could be the same height as me and my parents and we could all sing our gaither songs or our ron hamilton songs into just one microphone.    i liked our gigs, but i always fantasized about being the Murks.   urlLink     but i digress...  lonette, who is not only a gifted performer, but also a gifted just about everything else.  And my former student/ongoing friend married (the fabulous) Steve on the same day.  These two are ridiculously in love.  And cute (and i mean that in the *good* way) while being able to maintain a bit of an 'oh please with the sentimentality' distance from their incredible cuteness...  and rob, who insists upon growing and developing as a person more than most people I've ever met (tae kwon do, the artists way, piano, law, rhetoric -- all just in a span of one year of knowing him) has the ability to _be present_ in a one on one conversation more intensely than anyone you've ever met.  And I haven't met Monica (still!) because they, too, got married on the same day.  And JAN, for whom my daughter Jaelyn is named, an extradordinary friend/sister type to my wife -- and lucky me (not often that folks (me in particular) say this about our inlaws) as an extension of my wife.  Got married on the same day.  I took black and white candids during the whole wedding,  which resulted in this wierd out-of-body-sensation during the whole time.  I was there.  I was *busy* seeing....but I wasn't really there as a *person*.  I didn't sit in the places I usually would have sat, dance as much as i usually would have danced, talk to as many people as I usually would have talked to.    But I liked it.  Being distanced by technology was an insightful, enlightening experience as well as being an odd disembodied one...  it reminded me of how far i was from the other weddings of the people that i loved that day...  which reminded me of how odd it is to live in an era where often the people you love best live far away from you.  but because that very same odd world has given me the opportunity to know nathan and lonette and rob and jan.  i'm grateful too...

1717,Gemini,"       I own an umbrella that I have chased around the country. I have left it in truckstops, and restaurants, and have back-tracked 100 miles to retrieve it. It may seem silly, tracking down an umbrella, but this umbrella represents for me, one of the darkest times in my life.   I was 20, almost 21, and home from college because I was sick. No one was completely sure what was wrong with me, except that I was dizzy, fainting, and had massive headaches. I was scared. I felt completely alone and isolated from everyone around me. Part of it was my own fault, dealing with people made me miss the life I had been leading as a care-free college student. The other part of it was the 'fault' of the people who were around me. They had no clue how to deal with someone who was sick, and not elderly. I was also incredibly afraid of people.  Still, I digress, this posting is about the umbrella. During this time, an exhibit on Monet came to the Allbright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo. It was only pictures he had done at Givenchy, and I really wanted to go. My parents, and their friends got us tickets. We went to the exhibit, and about halfway through it, I nearly passed out.   I remember my father sitting with me in a chair, and that I never finished viewing the exhibit. Monet is one of my favorite artists, and I felt really horrible, since I had wanted to view the entire showing. I wanted to cry.   My parents bought me an umbrella, with Monet's water lilies on it. I got better, and have gone on with my life. Still, I keep this umbrella, to remind me of a time when I was so weak, I needed my father to help carry me.           "
1718,Cancer,"       I have expensive tastes.  Here lately I haven't been able to support those habits as in the past.  Now, I just settle for adding things I want to my gigantor list.  I was in Dillard's the other day buyin some pantays and of course I had to go by the perfume counter.  Bad idea.  I have been out of perfume for a long time now, and since I only like the expensive ones and would rather go without than wear anything cheap, I have been without for far too long.  The new  urlLink Cacharel Amor Amor  caught my eye and my nose first.  Then out of the corner of my eye I saw the familiar Boss logo.  Me love Boss long time.  So, I knew I'd like it without smelling it, but I had to anyway.  Oh My Gawd.  It's called  urlLink Boss Intense  and it smells like ... well, let's just say I got all turned on there in the big middle of Dillard's.  I must have.         "
1719,Aquarius,"       “We must not fail our duty, let us ride on!” Lysandros barked a command as he spurred his steed onwards. He muttered a silent blessing to Khaine as the fog begun to shroud the land. He and the few other scouts have lost their way among the fog, if he does not bring this message to Aldamir, the rest of the army would be in peril. Adamantios pointed ahead as a tide of darkness swarmed over the path ahead. Lysandros nodded as they rode into the trees, which provide ample cover for them. There was an order to keep silent and any communication was to be passed by hand signals. The chitterling horde marched forward, ranks and ranks of units were tightly packed together.   “I hate this damn whether!” Quikchitter bared his teeth. Quikwarp who stood proudly.   beside him nearly squirted the musk of fear as he tried to push it back.   He was honored to be invited by the Grey seer to ride upon the Cauldron of thousand poxes. As the cauldron went it releases terrifying screams and laughter, which would even send chill down the spin of a dragon. Quikchitter pondered about where will be their next destination, the arrogant Quikwarp was almost too proud he should have let him walked with the rest of the army. “ Quikwarp I have an important task for you.”   “What is your wish? Most potent of potentates,” He replied boldly as he swings his tail around excitedly.   “I need you to go down and check to see if the ratling guns are working well, recently there seems to be some minor malfunction,” Quikchitter spoke rapidly spurting saliva into the cauldron of thousand poxes. Only to be responded by hideous hissing sound.  His ears lowered and lost his enthusiasm as he heard the bad news. He muttered silent cures to the Grey seer and half hopingly that he hadn’t heard it. He made his way down the filthy corpses as he pinched his nose, he wondered how could the Grey seer have stand to all these perhaps he have a spell which could remove this repugnant smell. It was all too possible; the selfish Grey seer would not impart his arcane arts to anyone. As he walked towards his own company of clan Skyre rats, he thought he had smelled something. Among the smell of furs and rats, he smelled something unusual as he tried sniffing harder. “Elves!”  He curse the day that he had been born, the foul rats have spotted them. If they were to ride out from here they would be swarmed by hundreds of rats. There would be no chances of survival. If they were to abandon their horses here they would not make it in time to deliver the message. But sacrifices were needed to be made. He signaled one of men and whispered into his ears. His face betrayed incomprehension but swiftly nodded and proceeds to task.   The Grey seer stood upon the surveying his army as pride swelled within him. He attempts a grasp at the winds of magic. Gathering a small globe of energy in his hands, he blasted a slave pulling the cauldron. The rat expanded and contracted his eyes were red and was swelling to a point of bursting. Poxes and symptoms of diseases appeared on his skin. And soon the rat exploded leaving only a pile of bones producing putrid smells. “Faster, faster, quick, quick!” The Grey seer snarled as he lashed out with his whip. Suddenly, bells were rung and he knew they were being attack. Anger and rage boil within him as he wondered who dared an intrusion into his army. The frenzied monks broke of the ranks and gave chased towards their enemy. Shouting war cries and froth and phlegm’s dripped from their mouth. Quikchitter quickly cast a spell of vision, and so he could see clearly what was disturbing their flanks. The vision shifted in and out, blurring images and palpable ones. The spell stabled as he could see a horse running away from his army. “Stupid fools, its only a horse,” he spoke softly under his breath. A green light glowed madly on his fingers, sending the shadows dancing like a mad caper on the ground. He incanted the ancient words of his ancestors and unleashed a streak of green lighting towards the escaping horse. Reducing it into a pile of dust. The blood frenzied monks gave up as they saw there was nothing to kill and hurried back to bolster the ranks of the army.       A boyish smile appeared on his face as he savors the victory. “ Well done men.” Lysandros spoke softly but just enough for the elves to hear.          "
1720,Pisces,"        They constantly demean me because I have certain self-confidence. Certain meaning in specific areas, and none in other areas. For instance, I know I'm right most of the time. Why? Because I have a photographic memory. I can walk into a store and just be walking around, not looking for anything in particular, and a week later my mother can ask me how much milk is at the store and I know how much it is. I read an obscene amount (amassing huge collections of random facts that dazzle people who will listen) and I use my large vocabulary when talking. Yea, I'm arrogant, and I know it. I'm fucking narcissistic and I know that, too. I don't really give a shit.      It's just when my family degrades me and says things like 'go stand in your closet and stay there' or 'who cares, you live in fantasy land all the time anyway' that upset me. I don't understand it at all. I'm so cynical of the world, the only way I can survive is to read and  live in my fantasy world . The real world disgusts me so much that if I didn't have my own domain (my room, where I read and write and  live ) I would have gone through with the suicide attempts a long time ago. Like in the fifth grade when I first tried and almost succeeded to OD on random pills.      They disgust me so much. They gang up on me and I don't have a clue why. What the fuck, you would think they would be used to my ugliness and conceitedness. It especially upsets me when my stepfather makes jeering comments or sounds ('oink oink') when I'm looking for something to eat or am doing  nothing . Except usually when I'm out of my room someone will usually tell me to go back to my cave.       Oh, I have gone into this too long. I really hate to post depressed writing in here. They were just doing it all again and I am upset. I just went there to talk and play with my cat, but no. It turns into a ganging up on me once again, with my brother making lewd comments and doing imitations of me, and my stepfather doing much of the aforementioned.      But why I really wanted to post, before I got caught up in all that, is that I've implimented something new into my blog. On the sidebar I'm adding something. By January 1st, 2005, I want to have jogged 250 miles. Yes. There are 137 days remaining this year, and that averages 1.83 miles per day. Not a lot for a person in shape, which is why after January 1st I want to start running more. The 250 miles is just to get me in shape and geared for the Big Year. The Year of Graduation and All. Sooo...I'm making an image I'll update every Sunday night or so, with numbers of miles to run left, along with miles ran so far and days left to achieve this.      So thanks all, for being supportive of me. I hope you will all still be supportive during this time too, because I'll need a lot of willpower to do this. I usually get into shape and then quit running, get out of shape, and then repeat the whole thing again. This time I'm trying to stay in shape permanently.       On another note somewhat related, I really enjoy reading everyone's comments. I know I'm not interesting a lot of the time but it means a lot that I can count on you all. You're all great people and thanks for putting up with me.      "

1724,Aries,           Thanks to Mir for getting horribly sick so she could realize my greatness.         
1725,Cancer,"           First off I am going to say that The Return of the King or the 3rd Lord of the Rings, is the pimpest movie ever and even though it's 3 hours and 15 minutes long and has like 5 endings, it's still the best movie ever and ya'll should go see it. And if you hadn't noticed, I just saw that movie, and I didn't fall asleep or leave the theater once, which ya'll should know is an accomplishment for me.   Ok so throughout the movie, and well I think about this randomly a lot too, why do some words stick out in peoples heads more than others? Why are somethings funny, somethings sad, and somethings boring? Like really how do somethings attract to some people but not others? I don't really know where I'm going with with this, but it's randomly poped up in my head a lot and it's just weird how one person can see something and other can't. It's not just like that in movies or comedy, but in life and in people. How can one person see a quality that one may pocess and another not? Why do some people laugh at others jokes and others not? I don't get it, but maybe it was something I or anyone else will never know. I think it's that I just thought to much about it and ya this is where it has lead me.  And ya I'm sure most of it has to deal with your personality too, if you're a shallow person or well-rounded, if you like to have fun or sulk all the time. Who knows.  There's one thing that I must say is very weird. Usually when it's winter break I like jump for joy and am excited about it every second of the day. But this year it's different, I feel more overwhelmed then ever and almost more stress because it's like here's two weeks to take a break and have fun, but I'm not thinking about that, all I can think about is how much shit I have to get done this break and how I have like 5 essays to write, but really don't want to because Iw ant to spend 2 seconds of my life not thinking about homework or school. It's crazy but I honestly had a dream about my college writing paper and then during the movie randomly the thought of my paper came up too. I think it makes me more pissed off that we have a break, because for me it's really not a break, it's a time to catch up on everything that I've missed and start and finish things that need to be done. I also have to figure out when to get all my presents done by  and deal with hockey and soon lacrosse. Things just don't seem right anymore, they just don't flow and I don't know how to approach it anymore, I honestly don't. I know I say this all the time, but I just want to live one day without any worries or complaints or stress, just one day.  I'm tired though and I'm see this all turning into shit soon 'cause I can't think and barely remember the last word I just wrote. So ya night!   Make a true estimate of your own ability, then raise it ten percent.   Kati         "

1727,Aries,   joke moved to circle of irony  err...actually not.  forget it ever existed  These are not the droids you're looking for.    
1728,Capricorn,"       At 2015, Malaysian time on Tuesday, the silly ring tone of my handphone persistantly demanded my attention. I had to put on hold a bunch of sentences for my biology lab report just to grab that idiotic piece of equipment which was on my dressing table. Dragging my sticky body after my jog around the nearby park, I reluctantly pressed the button with a green coloured receiver on it. Just before I did, I recieved an impulse from my brain..    Brain : You are avoiding the number that ends with 28..    When I took a peek at the blue screen of my bloody NOKIA I saw 82 at the end of the number.    Brain : You scape-grace of a fool BoNdI, was it 28 or 82 you were avoiding?..      Unable to decide, with the failure of my brain memory system, I reluctantly pressed a button with an emblem of green receiver tarnishing its silvery hue.  Unknown : Hello?..................Hello?   Brain : Think, think, THINK! Is that the voice you are avoiding?    Me : I don't know, it's kind of deep, that voice I heard...... wasn't deep. It had the pitch of a    woman's...   Brain : Don't say anything. Just be silent.   Me : WHAT! Leave the voice to entertain itself....okay....I really can't decide..   I then pressed the complimentary button with a red reciever emblem.

1730,Leo,"       Another amazing night. Went to a show, met a gorgeously hot boy in a band. His name is Mark; he showed me his van, where we got really, really close... So close that he...Leaned in slowly, lightly bushing the hair from my face, tilting my chin slightly,..I felt his light,shallow breathing gently caressing me... So close that we...Could feel eachother's hearts beating...Pulsing so rapidly...That we...ALMOST kissed. I know, I know, that story should have ended better,but that's just how my luck goes. I almost had it..Then, time expires and I am rushed off by friends, leaving him there (though NOT by choice) And, now I'm sad, because, I may never see him again. But, not ALL hope is lost. He may e-mail me, which would be great. That would make me very happy. I really like him, a lot.         "

Yes, indeed  Those poor unfortunate souls  So sad  So true  They come flocking to my cauldron  Crying, 'Spells, Ursula please!'  And I help them?  Yes, I do   Now it's happened once or twice  Someone couldn't pay the price  And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals  Yes, I've had the odd complaint  But on the whole I've been a saint...  To those poor unfortunate souls   (...)(...)  Come on, you poor unfortunate soul  Go ahead!  Make your choice!  I'm a very busy woman  And I haven't got all day  It won't cost much:  Just your voice!   You poor unfortunate soul!  It's sad,  But true!

1734,Pisces,"         its vacation -- shouldn't i have more thoughts simmering than time to write them on a blog?   1. shouldn't libertarians *want* the government to stay out of regulating marraige?  + if Christians believe (a la Romans 1) that Jesus calls people unto himself by revealing himself throughout the world *&* if marriage is the best metaphor for God's consumation of his love for us *then* doesn't it make sense that *encouraging* gay marraige would allow everyone who partook in that part of God's truth to be led even closer to Jesus?  (Do you think I may still have a career with Focus on the Family?)  2.what if everybody thought that part of the legacy they left for their world was some stories.  Some people would continue the great oral tradition of storytelling, some people would blog a lot, some people would make children's books for their kids and grandkids, other people would make little movies.  And if we started thinking of *our* stories as reconsistituting a seam between our selves and the *place* worlds we lived in -- then even this little books and stories and movies and songs would have audiences...  3. i'm mostly a *post* evangelical because i'm so desperately concerned that the evangelistic / missional impulse to *get it right* and to *convince* an audience makes every story go south.  It chokes out the ambivalences that all good stories need.  4. I'm feeling like all my marxism and critical theory is making me feel too heavy about the world.  that my stories (particularly the dark play that i'm currently trapped inside) have been too sincere.  I love the flitting, easygoing COMIC FRAME that my Grandma Marge and Grandpa Andy use to talk about their complex and difficult lives.  And I think that maybe I need to write an essay where Grandma Marge and the narrator of 'Unbearable Lightness of Being' hash it out.  Because unlike Tomas' lightness, my Lampiris family heritage is rooted in great tragedy *&* laughter.  And unlike the surrealists exisistential irony, the Lampiris laughter is always both self-effacing & heartily *with*...  5. I leave for *the cabin' in one day.          'Treasure Island' (its other name) has been one of the deep resources of continuity and peace in my life, and when our family talked about the eventual possibility of being forced to sell it -- we argued about the merits of using profits to invest in a new family cottage (more accessible)? and honor Grandparents Rudds that way OR -- my dad suggested -- what about the horrific poverty of the world and our relative wealth?  Could we invest that profit in a way that would satisfy more people in more diverse ways?  It's the question of Mary Magdelene's absurd perfume performance art -- abject generousity VS. settling in the post-babylonic Jerusalem and 'planting gardens' -- investing in the systems that will provide long term resource for the Kingdom and world?

You can't find your other earring because your son is wearing it.   You drive to your neighborhood block party.   Your family tree contains 'significant others.'   You don't exterminate your roaches, you smoke them.   You see 25 lawyers chasing an ambulance.   More than clothes come out of the closets.   You go to a tanning salon before going to the beach.   More money is spent on facelifts than on diapers.   Smoking in your office is not optional.   You pack shorts and a T-shirt for skiing in the snow, and a sweater and a wetsuit for the beach.   When you can't schedule a meeting because you must 'do lunch.'   Your children learn to walk in Birkenstocks.   Rainstorms or thunder are the lead story for the local news.

1738,Capricorn,"           Cheerio guys!  Compliments to you for managing to make your blogspot censored in China. I don't know whether it's Ulli's sleazy girl stories or your idiomatic discussions that caused it, but somehow the chinese ministers decided to cut off the entire chinese population from it. What a shame! Thanks Ulli for keeping me updated every now and then. All the free internet porn is available though...   Well, what to say? I'm bounded at a deserted village in the outskirts of a medium sized chinese city (4 mill.). Life is very relaxed. I'm teaching about 14 hours per week, and I just bought a bike that basically is my major joy right now. People are the most friendly I've ever met, and because I'm generally the only foreigner they have got to know as well they seem very excited to have this norwegian curiousity here. I arranged a football tournament last week. The response was overwhelming with more than 20 teams. More than 500 people came to watch the final. My norwegian football shirt was given away to the one voted 'Most valuable player' of the tournament. I know it's a really american thing to do, but it was great fun...   To make this short I made a list with things I like and don't like about China:   Likes:  - Prices  - Pirate DVDs. After buying 4 seasons of the Sopranos and 3 seasons of the West Wing I've got home entertainment for the next month or so..  - Chinese, which must be the funniest language I've ever tried to learn.   Dislikes:  - 'Guanxi', a chinese word you better learn if you're ever gonna get into business with the yellow fellows. Guanxi means 'friends/connections' and is essencial for every thing you do. Hence, what you do is not as important as who you know. People here use to hang photos of their most important 'Guanxi's' on the wall in their office so that everybody can see that if you mess with me, you are also messing with him.  - Red Tape and Bureaucracy. If there's something you want to change or do, wait for at least 10 peoples approval. Something that normally takes from 10-30 days. I've been here for almost three months, but the college still haven't managed to give me an employment contract.  - As the subject indicates, why the hell do they stick to the chopsticks after the discoveries of knife and fork.

1739,Sagittarius,"           Check out the latest Department of Energy budget  urlLink here .  The amusing part comes from the amount spent on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (or 'The FERC', which sounds more appropriately ominous).  Any guesses as to how much money the DOE gives to FERC?  The answer: 0.  That's right.  DOE gives roughly $8 billion dollars to weapons research, and zip to the guys who have (arguably) the most influence on how much power costs in your home, and how to prevent things like blackouts.  This is why FERC can only hire starting engineers at  urlLink $38000 , whereas the national average starting salary for electrical engineers is around  urlLink $50000  (it's the 3rd most lucrative degree available).   It's pretty sad that such a potentially meaningful job has such poor salaries...and might explain some of the ill-thought-out work ( urlLink SMD , anyone?) they produce.         "

1741,Sagittarius,"        My Soapbox  One of the benefits of a blog is that you can speak your mind and blather on for hours and hours about whatever it is that you think is ruining the world at large.  And I feel a little blathering coming on...  I have, of late, noticed in the course of conversations when the speaker categorizes other people, or themselves for that matter.  I.E. - 'We 'colors' are like that.'  I swear a man actually said that to me; granted he was from an older generation that grew up in segregation.  Sadly he apparently still lives in that world.    But I had it yesterday from someone closer to my own age group; and he had a box for every race you can think of.  The jews this, the argentinians that; even 'we puerto ricans...'.  Maybe its just me in my own little utopian mind, but I try to not categorize people based on color, religion or nationality - or anything else for that matter.  In my world, people are people.    And that's something I love about the internet and the blogs you can find on Blogger.  There are no color lines, no country boundaries, no geographical limits.  The internet highway transcends the physical limits we experience in our every day lives.  Yes, you can find a lot of hate and ugliness (like that  Shudder  e-mail I recieved today - man was that ugly!).  But generally, when you look at a blog, you don't necessarily see the color of the author or the sexual preference or the nationality or even what country they live in.  You see the blog and the ideas and life experiences expressed.  You are given information to determine how you feel about the person writing.  Just something to think about next time you start to shove someone into a categorical box.  People aren't buttons and tacks to be placed in boxes with labels - if they were you could be sure Martha Stewart would be selling the boxes AND the labels for neat little packaging.   I will not be packaged.    *now quietly and humbly stepping down from my soap box* Diva out.         "
1742,Taurus,             i went to my first class.  it was pretty cool.  now i have to go buy all sorts of art equipment. ^_^  right now i have a 2 hour wait before my art history class. i just know it's going to be like this again tomorrow. -_-  traffic has worsened this semester.  they've cut off most of Woodward and everyone was trying to get into the parking garage this morning.  it was backed up all the way ocala.  on the way to school i nearly had an accident because some impatient driver decided that looking both ways before merging into traffic was a 'good thing.'  lucky for me there weren't any cars in the next lane so i could swerve out of the way.  *grrr*   but for now i have this interminable wait.  O_o  campus is way to crowded now.  i could barely find a computer to get on.  i had to come down to the basement to find 1 free 'puter.  and the union is just packed and noisy.  it'll probably get better once everyone waiting in line for football coupons leaves.              
1743,Gemini,"           At work earlier today, this old man came in wearing a ripped white shirt with his own black writing adorning the front. The slogan stated on the front 'how many NAZI's are there still in the ALP?'. For those of you that aren't familiar with Australian politics (ie you are from overseas or were educated through our public education system), the ALP is one of Australia's major political parties. Clearly the man is nuts. I've seen him a few times now, always wearing the same shirt, but today was the first time he spoke to me. I tell him to have a good day, he tells me that 'at least the fascists haven't bombed us yet'.   i put my second  urlLink The Bens  EP on  urlLink ebay  today. It is currently going at US$26 which is pretty ace.  Be sure to check out the hepcat.tk web board 'express'.

1744,Leo,"                 All of that time spent on Res Ipsa Loquitor for nothing.  Apparently they didn't get to it in class the day I missed, so we covered it today.  Actually, we pretty much only talked about how we weren't going to cover it.  The prof says it's pretty useless and almost never comes around in real life--so glad I studied it, and understood it.  He even went as far as to say that if we used it more than once every 10 years in our career it would be malpractice.  This came after the first 15 minutes of class we spend watching a movie on Billy Joel.  Yep, Billy Joel.  The prof had been doing 'a lot of thinking' about how to impart to us his feelings about the passing of both President Reagan and Ray Charles, and this video was his way of doing it.  The first part was a video of Joel and Charles recording the song Baby Grand.  The second part was his commentary on a song inspired by a Russian clown during the Cold War (can't remember the name unfortunately).  I really wish I could remember (that seems to be a recurring theme) what the prof said at the beginning, but he was asking our permission to devote the first part of our class to a humanity lesson or something like that.  It was touching, and definitely better than learning about limitations on duty.    Now it's almost 9 and I haven't done any studying.  I watched Oprah, took a nap, then went to the mall to meet a friend for Chic-fil-a.  Then of course I had to buy a shirt (it was only $7.00 though--I might go back and buy one in every color!).  My plan on this lovely Friday evening is to do all of my reading for Tuesday, then watch the Reagan funeral I recorded from earlier today.  Doesn't that sound like a wonderful way to kick off the weekend??               "

1748,Taurus,"          Saturday Morning approx: 11 o'clock and I just finished watching the time trials for the Tour de France.. I'm just amazed&nbsp;by Armstrong and the pace he has kept throughtout the 19 stages of this race. They say today that he has just confirmed his 6th win of the Tour today. Go USPS! and Most importantly Go TEAM U.S.A. !!!    Sorry, I ran off about the race in the above paragraph. My real intentions here today was to talk&nbsp; about the movie that me and the wife went to see lastnight. I would definately recommend this movie to people who love futuristic movies. I thought it was a good movie all in all, and maybe perhaps a little scary to think about what the future may hold. Lets face it. People are getting lazier and lazier and I dont think that robots are way off. Right now we as a race are relying on computers for more and more these days. In Auto plants where man used to line up for assembly they now have machines building these autos and thats not new..from my understanding these machines have been guilding cars for atleast the last 15 or so years..The problem is that..They (the machines) dont need breaks..so they build and build and the cars roll off the line better? I dont know about that. I do know however that I enjoyed the movie and that maybe those observations about assembly lines should be left with those men who work on them.    Go See The Movie.

1750,Sagittarius,"        To Explain my I-Mood  I am not a violent person.  In fact the only person I've ever hit out of anger was my ex-husband, 2 days before I married him.  Should have taken that as a warning.  Anyway, this morning my eye is twitching (a newly developed stress-related twitch) and I am completely on edge.  The thought occurred to me this morning on the way to work that I understand how parents can beat their children.  Not that I condone it or would ever hit my children, but out of sheer exasperation and frustration, I see how it happens.    I wanted to tear wings off flies or kick a dog or something.  Wanted to yell at my children to hurry up and blast my car horn at every driver in my way while I sped down the highway at 70mph this morning.  Some horrible seed of anger has sprouted in me this morning and I don't know why.  And I don't feel sad or anxious.  Actually I feel pretty good today.  And now that I'm at work, I'm calmer.  The room is quiet, my coffee is good and the oatmeal is hot.  It seems to have passed, for now...  Diva out.          "

My god of all the nerve.  Well he isn't getting any of my lemon juice this weekend.  That is if he shows up on time.  Anyway I saw him today.  Wow he got a new jacket and it makes him look slimming.

1753,Scorpio,"              Embarking  In about an hour's time I'll be on my way to Flinders, in the Mornington Peninsula area for an overnight camp/retreat/intensive with the rest of the community. We're going to be Equipped in tools, teaching, and the bonds of friendship, this Weekend, to carry us through the tide and turmoil of an everchanging world.  I got a frantic SMS from my mum today, read it disbelievingly, then called her back immediately, only to hear the distress in her voice. She sounded like she'd be crying, and rightly so I suppose. We just found out my closest Aunt, on my Dad's side, has been declared (and I  HATE this word) brain-dead. Brain-dead. Almost a cliche. Like a sufficiently melodramatic phenomena constantly portrayed in a daytime soap opera or Channel 8 serial.  She's on life support right now, and I don't have the full details, but suffice to say, I'm shocked. I had no idea this was coming. Her cancer's been in remission for awhile, and I'd never known that she'd been in-and-out of the hospital over the last couple of months. This was sudden. Bringing up her name always conjured up images of love, warmth, and fantastic food that we'd always enjoy at her place during CNY. And though we only ever saw each other during my trips home in the Lunar New Year period, we've maintained a certain sense of closeness, I feel. I'd anticipated meeting up sometime during my trip back in December (even during CNY again if possible), or if not, at the wedding in April, but now...  I don't know what I feel. Close, yet distant. Worried, anxious, helpless, yet...not quite believing it. Not quite coming to terms. Maybe my mum's message was wrong. Maybe it was a 'she  might  be brain-dead' kinda thing - mum often leans towards theatrics, it run in my family.  We'll just have to wait and see. Maybe I'm wrong. Hopefully. Prayerfully. Uncomprehendingly.           "

1755,Scorpio,"       This is that Sylvia Plath poem I was talking about.  Tulips                 Sylvia Plath        The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.      Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in   I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly   As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.   I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.   I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses   And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.   They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff      Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.   Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.   The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,   They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,   Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,   So it is impossible to tell how many there are.   My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water      Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.   They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.   Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage -   My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,   My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;   Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.   I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat      Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.   They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.   Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley   I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books   Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.   I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.   I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted      To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.   How free it is, you have no idea how free -   The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,   And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.   It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them   Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.   The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.      Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe   Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.   Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.   They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down,   Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour,   A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.   Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.      The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me   Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,   And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow   Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,   And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.   The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.   Before they came the air was calm enough,      Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.   Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.   Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river   Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.   They concentrate my attention, that was happy   Playing and resting without committing itself.   The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.      The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;   They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,   And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes   Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.   The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,   And comes from a country far away as health.     "

1758,Leo,"                 I think I jinxed myself when I made the comment about getting better about posting more often.  Oops.  We've got two weeks and one day until finals begin--I have a TON of stuff to do in the meantime, so I may be slacking a bit.  Keep checking back though, I'll try to post some short little thoughts whenever I can.    On another note, I saw 'The Notebook' this weekend with two of my girlfriends.  It was definitely a tear-jerker!  I wasn't as bad as the other girls though (one had a pile of tissues; the other needed a tissue but was sobbing so profusely she couldn't ask for one).  The acting was decent, though I much preferred the flashbacks with the young actors to the older version of the main characters.  The last scene was quite poignant though--I doubt it could ever happen like that in real life, but it was one heck of a way to end that movie.  I wonder if love like that ever really happens in real life...  If you like love stories it's a good one and I would definitely recommend it.  It's got some funny moments as well, so if you drag your man along he won't be completely miserable.   I would write more, but I'm in the library...duty calls.  :)               "
1759,Capricorn,"           in case you hadnt noticed i updated my profile to include this among my interests.  anyway, i decided to check out my last question (find a word from A G O S) in the handy dictionary and i answered my own question again!  wow, who needs other people when you have yourself...everybody.  so...the word is:  SAGO \'sa-(,)go\ n: a dry granulated or powdered starch prepared from the pith of a sago palm ad used in foods and as testuile stiffening (with thanks to our friends at webster)  how on earth am i supposed to know that this is a word?  just thought i would update you on this so you arent kept up all night fretting about this. p.s. the british open (apparently now 'the open championship' starts thursday! :')  let us hope for a successful title defense by the local boy ben curtis!  sidenote:  i play at his familys course all the time, and i got to hold and kiss the claret jug last year!  quite the experience...i have pics but they arent digital.  in case you were wondering.  now that i have peace of mind, off for some more physical therapy...this post was longer than i meant it to be.  anyhow, good night!

1760,Virgo,"       Through the smoked glass of the front door I saw a man fall. I heard the muffled thumps as he fell to the ground. My old man and I rushed to the back gate and barged it open. When had I put down the gardening tools we had brought with us I went in to see my old man helping ‘J’ up and getting him to a chair.  I first met J about a year ago. He, being the father of my old man’s partner, is the equivalent of a grandfather in my interesting family. Since I first met him I have probably seen him a dozen or so times. We’ve had family meals together, he’s more than once been round to fix the family car (which he helped buy), and, on occasion, we’ve been round his to lend a hand. I believe he was with the RAF in WWII, and/or shortly after, until he became a mechanic. He’s old school and he looks after his family. Based on my limited experiences of him I judge him to be a decent man.  J has cancer. I don’t believe it to be terminal but the medication he is on is strength sapping. It induces drowsiness and a lack of hunger, which makes it difficult for him to move around and consequently his muscles weaken through inactivity.  I never really planned on living beyond my mid-forties. A biological grandfather died of a cardiac episode at that age and I, even in my junior years, have had the occasional spate of chest pains. The way I saw it I might not live too much longer then 45 based on my genetic inheritance. Fair enough: we’re all born to die at the end of the day and I figured all I would have to look forward to at that age would be my prime behind me and a pension funded descent in front of me.  I mentioned this in conversation to my old man in the garden the other day. He stopped, looked at the blue sky, and told me that people on their deathbeds would fight to just get outside and look at the sun on such a day. Fight just to enjoy the pleasantly warm air.  Today I saw a man struggle to answer his own door and to get up and down his own stairs. Struggle to do what little he could. I got put of bed after either sleeping or dosing for 11 hours. I have lazed about for pretty much all of the holidays, not spending any effort to do hardly anything. A man struggled to do little more than open his own door.  I reckon there’s an awful lot of nobility in that man’s struggle, no matter how minor an event it may have been for. It shamefully reminds me I am but a child and that no matter how old or weak someone can become, if they struggle to do whatever they can then they are still a man. I hope to be able to struggle for so little if I ever am in that position as opposed to allowing lascitude to overcome me.  Excuse the gender discrimination.       "

1766,Libra,"       The income side of the equation is still too weak. I've been very good about lowering expectations, but the old income seems to be lowering itself even faster than the expectations.

1767,Pisces,"                 Last night was fun, but it brought with it realization that I am almost 25. In exactly 37 days, on March 2nd I will be 25.  So, last night I partied with my girls for the first time in  months . I arrived late of course (only because I had a prior engagement). I didn't get to the club till about 12:45 pm. Now it was  freezing  last night (something like -20 celsius), and me trying to look cute ((and not wanting to risk getting my coat stolen from coat check)), shivered outside in the line by myself. As I stood there holding my arms as close to my body as possible, teeth chattering, knees knocking...I asked myself what the hell I was doing there. While I love music and dancing...the club scene in Toronto is  ohh so tired  (to me atleast). Probably because I was hitting half of these spots since I was like 16 and now almost 10 years later, it's all boring. There's no more excitement in getting ready to go, getting in, getting that first drink and seeing all the other regulars. In fact, I initially approached last night with a sense of dread as I got dressed ever so slowly and further procrastinated leaving the get together which I attended before leaving to meet my girls at this party (which also further contributed to my lateness).  By the time I got in (after arguing/flirting with that ever so sexy bouncer at the door who tried to pretend like one of my friends hadn't given him a ticket for me), coat check was full. So I stood in the sweatbox slowly warming up and eventually overheating as I contemplated what to do with my jacket. By the time I had decided to stash my jacket at the bar closest to  our spot , I had consumed two tequila shots, a Coronna and half a Heineken. That marked the beginning of the end..... After being passed a blunt that was circulating, I knew that it would be a  slow  drive home.  I was in my own world as the music pulsated and I danced oblivious at moments to the unbearable heat. Despite my initial dread, I had thoroughly enjoyed myself.   I arrived home safely at 5 am...(obviously: since I'm here posting this today), and awoke at 3pm this afternoon. I love Sundays....next week I'll share with you why.  It's midnite. I started this post at 6 pm. But I got sidetracked and have only now gotten around to getting back online to actually post it.   rotating....  urlLink Goapele: Even Closer   anticipating....  urlLink Trinidad Carnival  which is now 22 days away.

1774,Capricorn,"       Believe it or not, every once in a while I like to leave the Bay Area. As you all know, I love San Francisco, Berkeley the Bay Area (which, in case you hadn't heard, does not include San Jose). I also love traveling and every time I return I appreciate what a beautiful and unique place San Francisco is.   Germany was a lot of fun. Kim, Marty, Oliver and I went to quite a few places around southern Germany in the sweet Mercedes Benz we rented. I'll have to get some pictures and post them. Unfortunately, it rained on and off for most of the time, but I think I still got some good photos.  Some of the highlights were the beer of course!; seeing the many castles scattered throughout the hillsides; Rhine River boat cruise, visit to the Porche factory (where I tried to get a job as a test driver- unfortunately, that didn't work out); Baden-Baden (spa town with mineral baths and swanky shops and a casino); driving through the Black Forrest; visit to Frieburg, which is actually in the Black Forrest, has a really cool brewery, the 'old town' has intricate cobblestone-mosaic sidewalks and streets with open gutters- which I should mention, you must be careful not to step in while walking back to your hotel drunk from the brewery; we stopped in Fussen to see the fairy-tale castle; and then onto Munich! Munich is the type of place that I need to go back to. It's a great city with lots to do and when the weather is nice you can fully appreciate the parks and the beer gardens.   I also picked up a little German. Here are a few phrases I found helpful while there (spelled  sort of  phonetically for ease of pronunciation):  'Bitte ein bier?' (say with a cute smile to the bartender as an apology for poor pronunciation)   Please, a beer?     'Bitte ein bild?' (say with a cute smile to a boy as an apology for poor pronunciation)   Please, take a picture?   'shIza!'   Shit!   'Fair-root!'  Cool!   'Das iz fair-root shIza!' That is cool shit!  'Das iz koo shIza!'  That is cow shit!   'Haben zie baden shaum?'  Do you have any bubble bath?   As you can clearly see- all very useful phrases.  So, for now, I'm just battling some minor jet lag and wondering when and where my next big out-of-country trip will be. I'll try to get some Germany pictures up on this blog soon too!         "
1775,Libra,"       It's 7:54 in the morning and im up because, last night, I went tanning, and I've ended up looking mildly like a lobster. I hurt so bad. Also, I have track in about an hour, and I'm feeling really nauseaus. Weather it's from the tanning thing, not getting a good nights sleep, or the medicine, because I am sick, I don't know. Last night, I do know, when I got up to put lotion on, I got really dizzy and felt like I did when I passed out that one time. And that's not good because I have alot of stuff to do today. I have to get the part B thing, go to the bank, put in app. at the golf coarse, and stop in at T-Mobile. Ughhh..So much to do. So little time. I'm glad though. I'ma get my yearbook on Monday. I've got to get some -people- to sign it. Man, I think I'ma be sick. Bah. O yeah, I definitly had the weirdest dream last night. Something about aliens, and a guy, and hubbard, and random kids, bible questions, french kids. I don't know. It was too much chaos for me so I just woke up. lmao. I don't want to do anything today.

1777,Aquarius,"                 When I was in elementary school, there were three things I wanted to be when I grew up -an ice skater, a teacher, and an astronaut. I ended up doing none of those things. In fact, I can barely stand up on ice skates! But it sounds like the dream of traveling in space  might still be attainable! Have you heard of the  urlLink Ansari X Prize ? It's a foundation promoting the private development of affordable space travel. The first team to take a craft that seats three people 62 miles up and repeats the feat within 2 weeks wins $10 million. As  urlLink CNN  noted, 'It's a contest to promote the development of a low-cost, efficient craft for space tourism in the same way prize competitions stimulated commercial aviation in the early 20th century.' And this morning, history was made when 62 year old Mike Melville took SpaceShip One 62.5 miles up and into space. Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, put up $20 million to help Burt Rutan and his company  urlLink Scaled Composites  accomplish this feat. Wouldn't that be so cool to someday take a family vacation to the moon? This is the stuff we read and see in science fiction, yet this time it's for real!  So in personal news, today was rather uneventful. Monday is always laundry and cleaning day. That takes up most of the day unfortunately! I did make it to the pool this afternoon. My back has been hurting a little the past couple days and it feels good to swim. I set a chiropractor appointment for Friday. I haven't been since we moved. *sigh* Another new doctor. Another round of nerves. I think it's just the unknown of a new dr's office that works me up. At least the lady on the phone sounded nice.  I thought I'd do something new and share a recipe with you. Hey that rhymes! I'm a poet and didn't know it! I made this salad tonight and it was unbelievably awesome! This came from the Jul/Aug 2000 Quick Cooking Magazine. Enjoy!   Summer Spinach Salad  1/2 cup vegetable oil (I use canola oil) 1/2 cup chopped onion 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons cider or red vinegar (I used red vinegar, yummy!) 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons sugar (I used Splenda, much healthier) 1-1/2 teaspoons ground mustard 1/2 teaspoon salt 1-1/2 teaspoons poppy seeds 8 cups torn fresh spinach 3 green onions, sliced 2 pints fresh strawberries, sliced 3 large ripe bananas, cut into 1/2 inch slices (I only used 1 banana cut more thinly and it was plenty) 1/2 cup slivered almonds, toasted  Place the first 6 ingredients in a blender or food processor, cover and process until the sugar is dissolved. Add the poppy seeds; process just until blended. In a salad bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. Drizzle with dressing, toss to coat. Serve immediately. Yield: 14 servings, or 2 REALLY large and yummy servings for 2 people!! =)               "

I am quite happy with it, but i just need to change a few things. Oh and no it didnt take me 3 hours to set up the PP thing- I am fine with that, it was doing things on Adobe photoshop that took me so long. anyway, now back to my last project.

1783,Aquarius,   This is my welcome message to me. 
1784,Libra,"       Yeah, I know I havent written in here since, forever. Alot has been going on. Well not that you could easily tell, with my lack of communication to the outside world. Yeah I have been thinking about lots of stuff. You know, that it is never good when I think about lots of things. Such an interesting frame of mind. I dont care anymore.  I wish that I could come right out and say everything that I have ever wanted, to whoever I wanted. Maybe all of this would then go away. Everywhere I go it seems that I unleash another memory. It has almost been 6 months and I still can't seem to get a grasp on anything. Like yesterday, I went to Best Buy to get 'Death cab for Cutie' because im in love with like 4 songs off of it, and when I walked down the cd aisle I passed this guy, and at that moment I got the largest wiff of axe from him. That brings back too many itself.  Last time I said anything about it to someone, I got relayed back to him. That's not gonna happen again. I watched the greatest film that I have ever seen in a long time last night. Its called 'Igby goes down.' Wowzers. It was so powerful. It has Kieran Culkin, who is, for those of you who dont put two and two together McCaulay Culkin's younger brother..the 'Home Alone' kid. Yeah... Anyways the movie held to many truths to my own life that I dont want to go into detail about and bore you with, so i'll save you from that.  Ok, I in relation to what is going on in my head I have kinda reached some questions that I cant quite seem to answer because I dont have all of the answers.  If a person reaches a point of lonliness, does that person slowly start to forget about what made them sad in the first place?

1785,Capricorn,"           my senior picture photo shoot went well as far as i could tell.&nbsp; i felt a little awkward with some of the poses, like when i was lying on the floor and he was like 'roll towards me a little bit'.&nbsp; i felt like a bikini model or something (since i obviously know exactly what that feels like).&nbsp; that withstanding, i think everything should turn out well.&nbsp; when i first talked to him today, he said 'if i remember correctly, you tend to blink a lot.'&nbsp; grr...this was bc he took the golf team pictures outside last fall and i was staring into the sun...all bc i wanted to have the girls soccer team in the background :)&nbsp; i think it was worth it.&nbsp; i only blinked during one picture today though.&nbsp; i have no idea when i will get the pictures back or at least see them.&nbsp; hopefully soon. i finished the hunchback of notre dame today (finally!).&nbsp; i honestly have no idea how they made a wishbone episode out of that book.&nbsp; 75% of it is not suitable for little kids.&nbsp; that is on the conservative end, too.&nbsp; it was quite a depressing ending, and the entire book was kind of scattered as well as morbid.&nbsp; i have mixed feelings on it...next up is jane eyre, which i think is the ultimate chick book.&nbsp; my mom reads it pretty much every year.&nbsp; i am looking forward to this less than i was rebecca.&nbsp; i think its the longest book i have to read, too.&nbsp; i guess i will have to suck it up at get it over with, right?&nbsp; (yes)          "

Oh well, I do think her bfren has her characteristics. That's why they click, maybe.       On to another topic. Read about HDB regulations (to CS: thank you dear for helping me with that), heaved a sigh of relief when I realised that we do not need to fork out ALOT of CPF or cash for payment. Whew..      A very HOT day today. and I meant REAL hot. think the temperature went up to 35 deg C or so in the afternoon. Yuks. Hopefully it POURS tomorrow. I love the rain, it gives one the sense of protection.

Of cos, they are spectacular when u look at them from a safe distance. But I always found lightnings angry expressions of a rainstorm.       Have to work tomorrow. Sigh.

1790,Gemini,"       Sometimes it is not so bad, living in the spare bedroom of the people who created me. After all, I am not paying for rent, food, utilities or any of the other things that people my age struggle to pay for month after month. Yes, I am trying to see the bright side of it all. After months of job hunting, I am still no closer to a full time position than I was in November 2003 when I was sequestered here. I try not to complain, or to feel depressed, but it is as bad as living in the parents' basement...except this time I am trapped on the 24th floor of a highrise condo. For those of you who do not like or know me well, I don't like heights like that. I don't freak out, but I also don't go out on the balcony, at all...unless circumstances beyond my control force me.  Lately I have been forced out onto the balcony more and more, by life and situations involving the parental units. It is easier to go there than to run screaming from the house at 2 in the morning when my mother is online plugging away at her own blog, and all I want to do is check my e-mail for five minutes. My mother stays up later than I do, and my father wakes up early. So, basically there is no time alone, unless they are both going someplace together, or at the same time.  So I spend tons of time locked in my room, with the television on in the background, reading, or doing one of my many hobbies. Ok so this piece says nothing more than what is going on each and everyday in my life...but sometimes that is for the best.          "
1791,Sagittarius,"             So, I get out of summer school today to go eat lunch. Wendy's, long line; Whataburger, long line; Chick-Fil-A,  extremely  long line; McDonald's, 4 cars? Maybe they're having problems due to the massive power outages we've been having, but I went over there since I figured I could get my food faster.   Yeah, it went faster, but I was very impressed by the system they have set up. Instead of using the normal speaker, there were 2 women standing outside with PDAs in their hands. 2 cars at a time would give their order, and it would be transmitted wirelessly into the kitchen. Then, they had a manager with a money belt standing near the first window so that both cars could pay at the same time. Then, each of the cars head to the second window to get their food right as the next set of cars is coming around. No wonder there's no line, even Chick-Fil-A's dual lane system doesn't work as well (or else they're about 100x as popular).  Still, the point remains that I think this is an awesome use of technology and that more restaurants should make use of features like this. Not just fast food, but also places like Chili's and other sit-down restaurants. Waiter is ready to take your order? He sends it back to the kitchen to speed up the process. Need a refill on that drink? Give something to the customers so that they can signal when they need one. If restaurants started to embrace technology with ideas like this, I'd gladly pay a few extra dollars each time I went there to help support the costs. 10 years from now, no telling how we'll be getting our food, but I can assure you that it will rely on technology much more than it does now.

1793,Taurus,"       My co-workers and I were talking today about what games we used to play when we were younger (talking about the 70’s here).  One thing that we all had in common is that we had apple fights.   Fall would be approaching – the apples getting ripe.  You’d start early to gather apples for your stash.  That was part of the fun – finding a place to hide your apples!  It had to be a good hiding spot where no one else could find them, but you also had to be able to remember yourself where they were AND get to them easily as soon as a fight broke out!  At first we’d just throw the apples at each other – the more rotten they were, the better splat could be achieved.  But then someone got the braining idea to stab the apple onto the end of a stick and fling it at your enemy.  This worked great… but we got even more inventive!  Remember those long, orange, safety flags for bikes?  The poles were made out of a fiberglass sort of material.  If you rubbed the end just right on the sidewalk, you could make quite the spear.  And being fiberglass, they were more flexible than a stick, and boy could you get some fling action going!   I miss the days of the apple fights… sure there were tears, and yelling, and the occasional “I’m telling mom”, but by evening we usually all made up and were out with our flashlights for a rousing game of Flashlight Tag.   My daughter doesn’t play outside as much as I did when I was a kid…  of course, things don’t seem as safe now as they did back then.  We ran freely around the neighborhood, playing in the creek, sledding down the hills, jumping rope in the park,  biking around the town…  Wish somehow we could find that sort of freedom again.

1794,Pisces,       i've decided by thinking about it for a long time that --   CUSSING has a much different effect in PRINT than in TALK.   Even though the digital age renders communication so much more *ephemeral*  there's something about SAYING words in this medium that give them more WEIGHT.  Have you read the unbearable lightness of being?  It's one of my top ten novels.    
1795,Pisces,               You are Peace.  You are at peace with your self and the world around you.  You have balance in your life and exude tranquility from every pore of your body.

1796,Gemini,"        Instead of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen, not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Tempestuous as the sea, and stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me and despair!    -- The Queen has come to a point of revelation…yet again, though this time not on her own. In the quest combating Passion in it’s varying forms, I came upon the safe and sound theory that abstinence in some areas of my life recently was necessary. We all remember the bathtub adventure with guards watching on as the Queen continued her observations in seduction and power. Not to mention my own personal lessons over time.   Why then is it that the Queen herself cannot see the obvious before her, the problems that led her to believe one theory to be correct. Remember if you will, the Queen’s experience with some rogue Minions when she was of the ‘coming out’ age. There was a resulting copy and evidence of said encounter that  has recently come into my possession through the 60 day abstinence. Abstinence of actual encounters are understandable - we don't want the wrong King to slip through to rule beside me. But why from myself?  Everyone is entitled to fears, and to face the dark periods of their life is something you both fear happening and crave. The Queen reviewed the evidence and since then, realizes…has been unable to enjoy who she is, to acknowledge her essence.  Why should this be? Yes she saw things she didn’t know happened to her. Yes she saw herself in a way that was most certainly not becoming of royalty. And yes, she saw herself gain control of the situation and escape.   Should this be something that keeps her from herself? Is this why perhaps she’s not willing to face herself in her darkest hours? I think it is.  I am passionate, I am a Life Force, these are reasons I am Queen of my element…it’s time to begin being Queen again.   My reign remains Supreme. Minions, Serfs, Guards, Maidens and Warriors…press your ears once more to my chambers, never shall my nature be stifled.   ---  Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infiite variety.  Other women cloy the appetites they feed,  but she makes hungry where most she satisfies            "
1797,Pisces,"       We were walking home from the plastic green playground at our neighorhood school last night.  It was a cloudy cool perfect night to be pushing our now-too-heavy-to-push stroller through the streets of suburbia…  And I noticed that someone was sitting in her parked car in her driveway.    I cycled through the possibilities:  she’s a stalker.  She’s crying because she doesn’t want to go in.  She’s crying because she’ll never go back in again. She’s numb and exhausted and can’t believe that her life has been reduced to sitting here.  In this car.  In this driveway.    And I realized that this image.  A person sitting in a parked car has a powerful inonicity.   Dr. Don Enholm used to tell us in graduate seminars on classical rhetorical theory about his weekends.  His wife perused antique malls all over the state of Ohio while he sat alone in the car reading the latest treatise on the Nuremburg Trials.   Sometimes when I found myself sitting in a parking lot, waiting, I wondered what it would be like for your life to eventually simmer down to a quiet read in an obscure back parking lot.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman just sat through most of  love liza  in his car while I watched it last week.    Wasn’t it Julieanne Moore's character who was sitting in her car singing in Magnolia?  I tell my kids that the “evil robots, programmed to destroy us” from  urlLink Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots  (one of their all-time favorites songs / albums) are probably cars.  Cars are robots I tell them.  And I hate car culture especially as I snake North on Cleveland Avenue for three miles of strip malls, car mechanics and fast food on the way home every day from work.    But I also get what it is to just feel okay about sitting.  Staying.  For a while at least…in your car.  When we take long trips with the fam in (the cleverly named) “Minnie” the minivan, we call it our “Shell.” And I like that metaphor for how cars offer us a bit of shelter.  We need it sometimes, don’t we?  Our human skin is so soft?  A bit of armour in a weary driveway or parking lot or metered spot is like a quiet breath of (slightly polluted) air.  Once -- before kids got kidnapped in Malls and before stalkers hid under the cars of wary shoppers in urban mythic parking lots -- my mom would leave eleven-year-old me and my two brothers in the car, sitting in the parking lots of malls.    On one of these days, I finally had had enough of waiting.  My two year old brother was crying and whining so I buckled him into the stroller and the three of us made our way carefully into Sears.  We were all crying or red eyed by the time we were inside and we announced to a store clerk that we had lost our mother.   But I think we had just lost our sense of being.  People can only sit in parked cars for so long.  No matter how much we need them to survive  May all of your parked cars be purged of suffocation and fill you back up with –  Peace~     "

1802,Gemini,"       So here I go again. Cursed by bad timing. If I had a dollar everytime I heard 'You are such an incredible person, it's just that I'm not capable of giving you what you deserve/committing' I'd have...a lot. Okay, so maybe not enough to buy a private jet, but at least a few rum and cokes on a private jet. And maybe some honey roasted peanuts. Hey those aren't cheap.  I take chances with my heart because it's difficult to get to know people if you they can't get to know you right? I swear though, the investment is killing me. Just when I felt fine being on my own I meet a guy like Dan.  He seemed so different and we connected from the start. He just isn't sure if he wants to be in a serious relationship after the last one he was in. He said all the right things, 'you're great...I'm an asshole...it's not fair to you...any guy with their head screwed on right would scoop you up in a heartbeat.'  But alas, he's not in that place in his life. Maybe if we had met later? He said he did feel like he was making a big mistake but he just had to go with what he thinks he's capable of for now.   For now, I am sad. I want to drink Mojitos and scream at the world. I'll have to bust out the Radiohead and visit my melancholic boyfriend Thom Yorke.  Just when I think my life has reached it saddest moment, I just listen to Thom and know I'm okay.          "
1803,Sagittarius,"        Sombody's got a bug up her ass today!   As an administrative diva, I live to serve.  I know that some people don't want to do certain mundane things themselves so they get me to do them.  I do it all, its my job.  And I usually do it with a smile.  Today, however, someone apparently has a problem with me.  Maybe she had too much (or not enough) alcohol and/or prescribed drugs last night.  I don't know, but she's in a mood.    First of all, she strolls into the office at 1pm - later than her usual 11am ETA.  Then, she flips out because the contract she promised to someone yesterday is in her mailbox for proofing.  She could have turned a few degrees to her right and faxed the contract to her client without incident.  Instead, she climbed the two flights of stairs and crossed the hall to my desk, where she threw the contract onto my desk for me to fax.    A terse voicemail about another client (which I had already handled) and a phone call to me about an e-mail she never received - while the rest of our staff managed to get it - and the day is only just beginning.  I have to remember that work is my blessing.  I may just laugh at her next attempt to make me as miserable as she is today.  Diva out.         "

1808,Scorpio,"       all I want is to be  at peace   at peace with my reason and my heart { Le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne connait point  do look it up, it might mean something to you... its french.}  I want to be free of this constant inner turmoil, and for the nightmares to go away.  I want to sleep at night... enveloped in the safety of... of something {I'm witholding things again.}  I can't make you understand... I can't make you understand how I can't cry anymore, and I fear I can't feel any more, that I've gone numb from this constant tearing.  I wake up in the middle of the night just in time to silence my coming screams, and in the dieing hours of the night, I remember things that by right are not my own.  I remember the nights I've died over and again.  The nights my wrists were slit, the nights my heart was gouged from between my ribs.  I do not understand this constant turmoil that you have bequeathed to me, why has this become mine, and how shall you save me from it, if you shall.  Why do I not believe a word that comes out of your mouth... why does it seem that each word drips with honey that instead of being golden sweet is bitter bloody red? and yet I long for the nights gone past when I was torn body from soul, and did not know the meaning of the word light, I did not know light or love, but I thought I did.  I thought I did and that was all that mattered.  I was safe locked in the dark dungeons of your heart, buried alive, but safe... and loved.  and that was all that mattered {Isn't it all that matters?}  It doesn't matter.  Nothing does. stumbling across things that remind me of you, the residue that you left, I find the words that made me smile, things I curse you for now, because I find that pieces still ring clear and true, and pieces are lies, all lies...promises made, the things I would never ask of you {or him either}  and I want to cry but I can't... why?  the threats, I've found those too, and I remember why, the swollen lump in my throat, the gasping for breath comes back all over again, and I remember why, I remember the pain... but there's still the pain I bear now, though different.  This pain is dull, like an ancient sword rusted away through ages of memory.  Your pain was sharp,  a sparkling dagger at my trembling throat.  I'm wearied of this hurt, and wish it to be no more...  I know you could kill this pain... but I fear you could bring your pain again as well.  These irrelevant familiarities kill me.  I know you too well, while I know you not at all.  You've always known that... always was a long, long time ago.  I was wrong then, and so were you.  Whose to say that things would be right now? {right now, not the future.}  Not the future, that you would not ask again the impossible of me.  Things you asked... the things I longed to do... the impossible.   and What of my dreams, my hope... my passion and will to live?  smothered and turned away... The trampled roses, blood red that I have nurtured to be more beautiful than before,  They shall not die. I am not quite who I was before.  I have learned not to fear the silence so.  I have learned that it is better to go than to stay, but to stay is neccesary if anything is to be accomplished.  I have learned what it is to be who I am, and I don't believe I could be bent like before {I don't believe, but I doubt, and that is my greatest fear.}  I don't understand.  that is all.  I don't understand.  ...and no, this time, I'm not alright.    "

1811,Taurus,"           'Being Twenty-Something'  They call it the 'Quarter-life Crisis.' It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are many things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now.   You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met, and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you don't recognize is that they are realizing that too, and aren't really cold, catty, mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you.   You look at your job... and it is not even close to what you thought you would be doing, or maybe you are looking for a job and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and that scares you.   Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and are constantly adding things to your list of what is acceptable and what isn't. One minute, you are insecure and then the next, secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward.   You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you. Or you lie in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough that you want to get to know better. Or maybe you love someone but love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you know that you aren't a bad person.   One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap.  Getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic.   You go through the same emotions and questions over and over, and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision. You worry about loans, money, the future and making a life for yourself... and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd just like to be a contender!   What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it. We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out.  Send this to your twenty something friends.... maybe it will help someone feel like they aren't alone in their state of confusion.....    GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF US!!         "

1813,Cancer,"       the humidity of recent days has lead to increased insomnia, but has also lead to the first five minutes of returning home into a game of how fast the vast majority of my clothes can be removed. right now i am wearing only the shorts that earned me the name of 'chicken legs' earlier this year. maybe it is something about this room that tends the occupant towards nudity?  but i have done well today; visiting town for the briefest time i have bought a mouse for purely rational. as much as i like the trackpad, it is time for seriousness. seriosity, if you will.  serioucism?  anyway; the online delivery charge of 30% of the mouse's worth causing the trip to town, i was pleased to quickly find the one i wanted on the shelf. in a cylindrical-type packaging, admittedly very fetching, there was no information as to whether the software is on cd or diskette. i asked the man in the shop 'is the software on cd for this mouse?'. i held up the mouse i meant. 'oh yes', he said.  let me tell you now, he is a lying swine.  so now i have no immediate way of loading my mouse driver. purely rational has no floppy drive ( it is a laptop of the  future , and besides i couldn't be bothered to pay for an extrenal drive). my old laptop  does  have a floppy drive, but it doesn't have a cd burner. nor does it have a modem or network plug. or usb ports. (it is a laptop of the  past , and besides, it was free). in fact, of their 26 assorted ports and things, there is  no way whatsoever  that i can make the two machines talk to each other in the way i would like without buying some extra (read: 'expensive') hardware. shocking. anyway, i've arranged for it to be done now. but ergh, it annoys me. i might write a snotty letter to dixons (no link because they are evil evil lying swine, although they offer cordless optical mice at affordable prices) and hope they send me  urlLink something cool .   new cd: welcome interstate managers, by fountains of wayne. very good.   stopping by the supermarket on the way home to spend a fortune (£14) on my continued survival, it is interesting to note the hastily-erected shelving selling umbrellas. in august? sheesh. i pick up some essentials (bread, milk), some healthy things (oranges, tomatoes), and some random bits (stir-fry sauce, biscuits). i have recently taken to swiss-style meusli, that is to say meusli with raisins, nuts, and no extreme political views.  i resent paying over  urlLink 50p  for a loaf of bread; sure it tastes nicer but seeing as i never get through a loaf fast enough to avoid throwing the last three or four slices away (as i did this morning). i am now trying 'stays fresher longer' bread, 44p. i have high hopes; except i have doubt about the grammar. shouldn't it be 'stays  fresh  longer', or just 'stays fresher'? or am i too worried about my bread?   the last thing to mention today is the post office; and some interesting distinctions in the british postal service. i am sending a friend a cd, and i am enclosing a brief letter with it. if i send it as a 'small package', it is cheaper than sending it letter-rate. imagine you are sending someone a book; if you send it on its own it is a small package and can be sent (relatively) cheaply. if, however, you enclose a 'letter' with it, then as far as the post office is concerned the  entire weight  of the parcel is your letter, and you are charged accordingly. but what constitutes a 'letter'? for the small package rate you are allowed to enclose a brief letter which references only the item you are sending. so, if you write 'dear jeff, here is the copy of  three men in a boat  i promised, hope you enjoy it' then no problem. but write 'dear jeff, here is the copy of  three men in a boat  i promised, hope you enjoy it. little malcolm fell off his bike yesterday...' then pow! you have just (according to the postal service) written a comic novel. so if they ask you if there's a letter inside when you're at the counter, you know what to say. and you too can make sure you're sending things as cheaply as possible, even if it does mean you have to write (as i do) 'small package' on everything you send...   nmrboy's currently favoured dinner: pasta (enough for 2, cooked) cheese (small cubes of) cooked ham (diced) tomato (1, raw, chopped) olive oil ( extra  virgin, whatever that means) basil (not a siberian hamster)  all mixed round together, serve hot and frequently. food = good; or at least its the most similar word you can form with a standard 'qwerty' keyboard. coincidence? well, probably...  n.

1814,Leo,"             well well well, what have i got here... a decent website provided by Google.com. How wonderful, just exactly what i needed all this time.   Frankly i have to say that i am a member of this webstie since May 2004, in truth i had subscribe to this webside due to that i wishes to have a gMail account and somewhat i have read somewhere that this can get you one. But well i am not concern about gMail no more as i already have other webbased account with bluebottle.com plus free pop3 included 50mb and also very impressive way of keeping all junk mail out of my life.

1815,Cancer,"           As I was sitting here ealier, of course pondering whether or not I should start my hw at 8:00 at night, I like something was on my forehead. I do one scratch, one wipe, one hit, nothing. Two seconds later, I feel it again. Now is the time I started getting freaked out an paranoid and heck, I didn't even know if something was there. However, this time when I took my hit to the head, something flew off onto my keyboard. When I first noticed that something was actually there, I shrugged in disgust, but then when I look down to find something of a spider, my eyes widened and I froze, giving it a blank stare, as in what should I do now. With a closer look though, I notice it was more than just a spider, it was a tick! This is when I jumped back and called for my mom to take it away. There was a tick crawling, not only somewhere on me, but on my head, in my hair!! Who knows how long that was there for, but in uter rage and fright, I just wanted to cry, which I almost did. I can't stand bugs, especially not the mere thought of one actually being on me, and especially with a bug that can dig into your skin and basically create a home there.  I then felt even more dirty than I had felt before, just getting home from a lacrosse game, and felt distinguishably out of place feeling as if a colony of bugs were on me or swarming towards me. I jumped in the shower to feel it all just wash away down the drain. No more filth, no more bugs, no more fright. I felt warm, clean, and clam after a nuroishing shower that no only wiped away my paraniod thoughts, but also my stress and anger of the day. I felt renewed and fresh, and to only think a bug had truely gotten me there.   I get dressed, sit back down, and then realize the studying and hw I still need to do and the lack of motivation I have for it. All my thoughts that had left in the shower, now come rushing back to haunt me and torture me. One more day of the week, that's it, but one more night and day before than. I am now back to where I started. Time just goes round and round. Meh.  Happy day to you.  Kati           "
1816,Capricorn,"       I went to a bonfire at Cody's (B.) house last night. It rocked. Literally, considering we listened to Razor 94.7 the whole time. Anyway, it was Cody, Julia, Jorie, Spencer, and of course, myself. It was just hysterical. We spent the majority of the time playing word games. We had to go to the store to get hotdogs and the second Cody walked in, she asked: 'What did we come here for?' XD ...Oh, and Spencer ripped Jorie's shirt. OO;; Don'task.  Most Hilarious Quote of the Night: 'We're speaking in sentences!' -Cody  It was awesome. We have GOT to do that again before the end of summer vacation.  Okee, on to other matters...  CORGI PUPPIES!!

1818,Capricorn,"                 Just as I posted Part 1 on this topic, I thought up more to say. Compare our expectations of teenagers now to the expectations of teenagers throughout history. It is really only in the latter part of the 20th century that these low expectations developed. Why? I don’t have an answer to that one yet. My general guess would be the increased emphasis on the individual, and less emphasis on the family. I draw my idea of what the teenager was in history from my literary experience. For (and this is a whole other topic to blog about) literature and history cannot be separated. I’ll one of my favorite books as an example.  Sense and Sensibility , by Jane Austen, is really a study of two teenagers. Two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, are the central figures. They are 18 (or 17? Not sure about that one.) and 15 respectively. Both, though they behave very differently, are young women of character, principles, intelligence, and learning. They respect their mother, and show support for her in their time of need as a family. The plot of the book (as in all good books) is driven by their different characters, and combination of flaws and virtues. Their faults, and now that I think of it the faults of many teenagers in classic literature, result mainly from a deficiency in experience. I don’t know if I’m making any sense. But anyway, my point is that the way we view teenagers today is not the same as before. Many great man and women, Jane Austen, James Madison, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Aquinas, and many more showed their potential during their teenage years. From the way teens are expected to behave now it is hard to imagine them having any potential at all.       "

1822,Aquarius,"                 Well, I promised to return with great tales of familial dysfunction, and I am as good as my word.  On our way to the Outer Banks we stopped off in Williamsburg to have a short visit with my grandmother. We have a cute nickname for her which all the grandkids use, but after this trip I think I’ll have to come up with a more descriptive name to call her. (Not to her face, of course.) Within minutes of being in her presence, she looked discerningly at Alverice and me and said, “Hmm, both of you have put on quite a bit of weight.” Now, after knowing her for 26 years I’ve come to expect her to be downright bitchy most of the time, but somehow it still shocks me when she says things like that. “Thanks for noticing,” was the best response I could come up with. A few minutes later when A and I had left the room my dad (who has been under a great deal of professional stress lately and is literally on the verge of a breakdown) took his mother aside and sternly told her she had been rude and demanded that she apologize to us. She refused, then asked my sister Keegan, “Were you raised to disrespect your elders?” A few minutes later we left, and our vacation was off to a joyful start.  The week at the beach was actually rather uneventful this year, which is a good thing. Because of my dad’s emotional state, my parents decided to rent their own house separate from the rest of the extended family. This turned out to be a great move; most of the drama usually involves one of my uncles saying something inflammatory and my dad freaking out about it. This year he could just go over to his own house when he started getting annoyed. Also, because everyone was aware he’s having a hard time, there was much less provocation than there has been in years past. My uncles are the kind of people who like to “stir the pot,” so to speak, and they don’t normally have the sense or the emotional maturity to know when to quit. So it was encouraging to see that they’ve learned how to keep quiet, if only for a few days at a time.  I think the best part was hanging out with my cousins. There are 12 of us, and we only see each other once or twice a year. I had a great time sitting in the hot tub late at night talking with Chalissa and Rehanna, who are 16 and 17 and both getting ready to apply to college. Every time I see them I’m shocked at how much they’ve grown, and impressed with the wonderful people they’re becoming.  Another fun part was that Paradise, my aunt by marriage to my uncle Benteen, brought her mother Audeanne along. It was nice to have a grandmotherly person there, especially since Audeanne is the exact opposite of my own grandmother in every way and is one of the sweetest women in the country.  On Thursday night at dinner all of us remarked that the week had gone exceptionally well. The weather was perfect, the water was warm, we ate amazing food every day, and we were all getting along. In retrospect, we really should have seen it coming. On Friday morning my uncle Arville and my dad had a run-in about what to do for dinner that night. I won't get into detail because frankly it's extremely silly and boring. Suffice it to say, words were exchanged. That evening we all went to see  The Village  (which I loved) and back at the house we all sat in the living room having a nice discussion about the film’s meaning. I wasn’t in the room when it happened, but apparently Arville said something that provoked my dad in just the right way and a nasty, nasty argument promptly ensued. It ended with my parents back at their own house and my uncle fuming at ours until late at night when he seemed to calm down a bit after sitting out on the deck by himself and coming back with an oddly grassy smell.  On Saturday morning they apologized and everything was OK again. Just in time for Alverice and me to head back home.  So to summarize, we had a good time, and we are now more tired, tan, and fat than we were when we left. Long live the family reunion.              "

1824,Gemini,"             So I work in a museum. The Seattle Art Museum. I love it. My co-workers are awesome. My bosses (plural) are also pretty nifty. Previously, SAM wasn't exactly what I would call...um, world-class. But currently we have an exhibit visiting from the Kroller-Muller Museum in the Netherlands: 'Van Gogh to Mondrian.'  We are one of only two museums in the U.S. who get this exhibit, the other being the High Museum in Atlanta.  Kroller-Muller (sorry for the lack of relevant punctuation) is a museum created from the private collection of Helene Kroller-Muller, who had the largest private collection of Vincent Van Gogh's work in the entire world.  Apparently she managed to get upwards of 80+ of his drawings at one time.  Cool stuff.  And the main reason I am working here, as Van Gogh is my favoritest.  I've travelled far to see his work: Boston, Los Angeles, Paris...Lots of other people are very excited to actually have something of this magnitude in Seattle.  Which is fine.  However, here at the membership desk, I am running into a lot of people who will seemingly say ANYTHING in order to try and get in for free.  Is this because they are poor, and the prices ($15) are too high, and they really just want to appreciate art?  Or is it because they don't care that they are LYING, and would do the same thing in order to see ANYTHING for free?!  AUGH!  I really shouldn't even attempt to go into the bullshit that I am submitted to.  Let's just say that I know our admissions/membership policy up and down.  And the people who try to give me a line are usually our very own museum members!  Who are already getting in free!  And somehow they think that anybody they happen to be associated with ALSO gets in free.  And my thought is, we need people to buy memberships and tickets in order to keep the museum going.  That is why these people bought these memberships in the first place.  Do they really want to deny the museum much needed revenue?!  I don't understand the evil intentions of the public.  It really chaps my hide.  I would never even conceive of doing this type of thing myself.         "

1826,Taurus,"           I went on a blind date last night. I've been on tons of them: well meaning friends, internet services, etc. I've been on so many now that I don't even get gussied up for them anymore. I know it's not going to go well so I stop trying. (Probably the wrong attitude to have but history has demonstrated that I don't do well on blind dates.) I wandered into this date with the amour of a slug; no flirting, no cute smiling and batting my eyelashes, and no matter how much I drank, I was just not attracted to this guy.  He was a nice guy, a smart guy, a relatively interesting guy, but there was no chemistry. He wasn't shockingly unattractive, or shockingly attractive for that matter. He simply had the charisma of a Cuisinart. I dominated the entire conversation. Silences between strangers are so uncomfortable for me. And of course, when I start babbling about nothing, I start to repeat myself. Constantly. It's worse when I've had a few.  I suppose the problem was that the whole affair lacked any sort of intensity. How to remedy that though? Go sky diving on a first date? (I could just drink too much and pee myself, there is really no need to pee myself while screaming and falling out of an airplane.) There is this dating show on TLC or Lifetime or something where they teach one person how to date properly. (I didn't know there were rules.) It's certainly a temptation. I am confrontational, not very invested in the date, and need to be pretty socially lubricated to feel comfortable. Of course, doesn't everyone?  Here's the deal: I'm too picky. I want one person that embodies everything I want in a mate (which I haven't drawn up a solid list for just yet). I basically know that my ideals are so unrealistic, even if I knew them, that I am doomed to a lack of any discernable social life. I have been completely screwed over by so many people in my life that I am highy hesitant to allow anyone that finds me even moderately attractive to be in a position to hurt me.  This has been the 'sappy, poor me post.' I promise VERY few of these in the future.          "

1828,Leo,"            Darkness, And Lack Thereof.   I am in love. I've never been in love before, and it's a new and exciting time for me. My  newfound love, the one who completes me, whom I love without compromise, is published by Lionhead studios and developed by Peter Molyneaux. I'm talking about Black and White, the most amazing game to ever be released for any platform. I'm not biased or anything (go buy it now) but it is my honest opinion (even if you have to sell your body to afford it) that you should buy this game, and soon you will pledge your undying love to this masterwork, this opus, this bar-raising product of pure genius. In Black and White, you play a god, created by the prayers of some poor little suckers/innocent islanders. when you arrive, you start helping out the village and learning about your godly powers, you can be nice to the people, or you can be evil and kill them with wild abandon, giggling the giggle of a wicked god throwing his followers into the sea at several hundred miles per hour. I took a mostly neutral path. I will sometimes be a little nasty and roll a boulder thru town or something, but I'm quick to call up a food miracle or heal the village. Oh yeah, and you have a creature. Your creature is your avatar, an extension of your powers and your representative in the physical world. I have an ape who throws cows but eats sheep. The creature is a miracle of coding. the AI is astounding - they will learn from your actions and can take care of themselves if you teach them well. My ape knows to eat when he's hungry, drink when he's thirsty, and poop on trees when he, well, needs to poo. Your environment changes when you change - if you are evil and spend all your time terrorizing people, your land will become dark and evil to match. your creature can change as well, becoming evil or good depending on how you trained it. when I first got my creature, I beat him senseless  (you can slap or pet them if you want to punish or reward them), of course, I felt like an abusive parent when my badly bruised ape had to go to this guide creature to be trained. There are several 'neato' features in the game that set it apart from pretty much everything else: the game has a built in email client, and can name members of your village after names in your address book. The game also has a weather system built in so you can go register the game and where you are, and while in the game, the weather on your land will match the weather in your real life area. Did I mention the gestures? you can draw shapes with mouse movements (called Gestures) to create miracles and such. some are a little tough, but it really helps in blurring the line between the game and that other thing that happens outside the game (I think somebody called it 'a life'), since you don't have a bunch of menus clogging things up. I would also like to mention the amazing look and feel of the game in general. it starts with the lionhead logo - it consists of a bunch fo blakc and white spheres floating around, which eventually form the company logo. You can interact with this logo as it forms. moving the mouse makes the spheres swirl around in response. Once inside the game, you can zoom right up to a single person, then zoom out to above the clouds, all in one swift seamless motion. All the movement is smooth, and when the in-game cutscenes activate, the camera moves under its own power, and there is realy no indication that anything has changed, except that you are no longer moving the view. There is just too much in this game to mention without writing a book about it or something. Go get it, now. this game is beyond amazing, it is beyond anything ever made. It will be remembered in 20 years when many more games have copied it. You will fall in love and forsake your real life and wish that you could just live in the game world. I need to go play Black and White now, so you people all go buy it.         "

Who are we to be so quick to pull somebody down just because their idea worked? I saw the movie in the arthouse theatre down the street, long before it went wide and 'mainstream' -- and at the time I thought it was clever and well done. I doubt that the movie has deteriorated in quality just because it's popular  And my favorite quote from that horrible rant on SUVs that started this newest thread: 'Consider this startling fact: the SUV is the only reason the United States has been unable to comply with the Kyoto Accord on air pollution.'  Consider this startling fact: I can make up any damn fiction I want, and as long as I state that it is explicitly a fact, readers will accept it as so (especially if they are already pre-disposed to agree with said fact), even without any type of documentation to back me up.  It doesn't matter what I say So long as I say it with inflection That makes you feel that I'll convey Some inner truth of vast reflection But I've said nothing so far And I canm keep it up for as long as it takes And it don't matter who you are If I'm doing my job then it's your resolve that breaks         "

1833,Gemini,"       Yesterday as I was walking to get a cab, I saw a woman trip and fall onto the sidewalk. She hit her face and her glasses came off. Now being the clumsy person I am (having totally wrecked up both my knees with falls such as this) I had to help. She seemed to be about 60 or 70, and was with her sister. So I brought her back to my office and let them use the ladies room. I had noticed people stop when she fell, but hardly anyone was willing to help, one man stopped to help her up, but some people actually walked past 'tsking'. It was a very odd situation, and it reminded me about the first time I tripped hardcore when I was living in Brooklyn. I was walking with my laptop bag and I tripped on the sidewalk (nothing new) but because of the weight of the laptop bag, I was thrown off balance and really hit the dirt. I ripped my pants totally open, my hands and knees were absolutely wrecked. And then I look up, there is a guy about 30 on a payphone just staring at me and SMILING! And I mean I hit the dirt!  He didn't do anything just stood and was kindof laughing at me, probably telling his buddy on the phone about how funny it was.  I'm not sure NYC looks so alluring anymore. The garbage, the people... I think I am just loosing my patience. New York is a great place, but I still feel like nothing's changed, and that people have pacified themselves by putting up flags and talking on the train about how they are making plaques out of I beams for commemorative purposes... I won't even go there, I'm just fed up. But I do love NY    "
1834,Capricorn,"                 We've been studying the human body in Science, toward the end of this year. It's so intricate, but somehow it seems so disconnected with life. It's hard to explain, but the different processes that keep us alive seem so far apart from the things we think and do. Maybe it's just me. It's as if all the cells, signals, nerves, and organs that do their functions are apart from me rather than in me. It's as if there are two parts to a human: their physical self, and their mental and emotional self. Does anyone else feel this?      "

1838,Gemini,"        It's raining again. The sky is emptying itself and the thunder's so loud. It's as dark as night. The rain sounds so beautiful, pattering upon the world. Everything has a musty, damp smell. The sky seems to split from the bright lightning and deafening thunder. The pine tree in our yard glistens in the rain. It's dark enough the street lights have come on. There is another smell in the air. Is it smoke? Sirens sound in the distance. Maybe the lightning has started a fire. A car drives past with it's window down. Do they notice? I'm sure the fat raindrops have reminded the driver what being wet feels like. All the while flashes of lightning lace through the sky as it grumbles and occasionally shouts to remind you it hasn't left yet. A large flash of lightning lights the sky and, even though the sky grumbles in the distance, I can feel the tension, an absence of sound, as if the whole sky is waiting for the thunder. With a few more angry cries the storm receeds into the distance and true dark settles in. There will be no sunset tonight.   Inside the house smells of damp cat litter, or maybe it's just frightened and drooling dog. The departing storm is a whisper now and the artificial lights can only just hold back the dark that seemed so comforting outside. We hide beside our little lights, just like we hide fromthe storm under our roofs. How many times do people actually get soaked, wet to the bone, when it rains? Only little children or those young at heart seem to enjoy the thought of dancing in the rain. We become so acustomed to being protected. Hiding is so easy when you think of facing the storm.      "

1840,Cancer,"       Today was a somewhat crazy day.  A kinda' boring day as we spent our time under stress at the Economics tutorial in which we made to be under a limited time to complete essays...approximately 45 minutes or so. Furthermore, the other class was so damn noisy that I couldn't really concentrate and had to stop short in my tracks whenever I wanted to resume my essay...*sigh*...enough of such thing already~~perhaps it ain't a good time to talk about it~~ -_-  Another problem that is currently pending would be Project Work. It is so kinda' difficult to coordinate, in my opinion, that we had to probably create some disputes while in the progress of it too. Never mind...and I guessed I would delay my Constitution's effect until end of this week due to the badly done draft, which requires editing again. A strict one that would allow a better student to awaken within me.  Why do I sound like someone in my class? Oh no~~~I mustn't change personality again...especially after secondary school where the major change from extreme introvertism to moderate introvertism is there. What else can I say about today?

1849,Sagittarius,"        Munday  Had a very relaxing weekend.  The little divas went to Grandma's so I got to sleep in on Saturday and Sunday - nothing more delicious than sleeping in on the weekends.  My hair is back to a rich brown - sans gray - espresso was the name on the box.  so, after a few extra hours of beauty sleep and a dip in dye, I'm feeling most fabulous once again.  Why, I may even paint my toenails tonight!  Ooh, such decadence.  And littlest diva's pre-k teacher came up with a great way of avoiding the morning separation anxiety drama that we've all been subjected to for two weeks now.  Instead of prying her off my leg as I attempt to escape the classroom, the teacher meets us in the cafeteria.  This way, there is a smoother transition from daughter to student.  And you know what?  It works!  I left that little girl in her blue and beige uniform, with tweety bird lunchbox slung across her shoulder, hand in hand with her teacher.  Bye, baby... kiss kiss.  And out the door I went.  No drama, no tears.  Life is good.   ** one note - i've been visiting the blogs that I know and love, and have tried leaving comments.

1858,Scorpio,"              This post was brought to you by the letters B, H and G, and by the number 33  Arghf. It was a high of 33 degrees celsius today. I felt like I was back home in Singapore. Except, unfortunately, I do not have the luxury of entering my room to turn on the air-conditioning, because, well, golly gee, I don't have one!  It's sweltering, the heat is intoxicating, stifling, almost as if yr baking in an oven. Even the fan that rotates near your face does not provide a reprieve, except to blast dusty air into your stuffed right nostril (I've got a bit of the flu at the moment). Sigh.  So the nap I took in the afternoon, or rather evening  - woke up about 8pm (and there was still sunlight - I tell you...I'll never get used to this) - left me feeling groggy and more tired than I was before. I can only describe the feeling in one word: bleuuurghghhffffgg. I felt extremely bleuuurghghhffffgg.   And the next coupla days promise to be worse. It's rollercoasting up and down, from 23 tomorrow, to 33 the day after, to 19 the day after that, to 23 on Thursday again.

Lynn's style - my wife has become so daring and expressive and bold both in her personal 'look' (which is hot) and in her thinking about her profession and vocation (which is deep).  3. family dance nite - we light candles and writhe -- these days to the Flaming Lips (Jaelyn has a longterm, ongoing thing for the character and song -- Yoshimi) and Rufus Wainwright (i must also allude to the eargasm that song #3 from this new album - WANT - gives me when i listen using earphones. i'm pretty sure it would have a similar effect upon anyone even slightly open to the world of suprising sensual delight).  4. emails from old friends - I need old friends.  The day to day social fabric of my life feels precarious and threadbare -- in general premised upon too many 'professional' relationships.  5. boundary breaking - a few 'professional relationships' -- students and peers -- who are shockingly honest and regularly kind  6. cottage cheese - i don't know why, i just love it right now.  7. phone conversations with daniel - we've been concocting more than our average share of thinking / heresy lately.  8. grey skies and a midwestern chill in the air - i'm a northern boy, what can i say?  9. impending thanksgiving - traditionally Rudd thanksgiving is our favorite holiday of the lot.  can't wait. (i'm particularly eager to see Ang & Ryan's new house -- which will be -- I'm sure -- *very* goth.)  10. hair wax - i can't believe how much difference it makes in the day to day grind.  * not neccessarily in order. except for the last one.  b/c that's a little bit tongue in cheek.  ** as for the title: my friend Greg used to regularly be 'into' new things -- he's an early adopter of, i think, all important trends.  this *is*, if you're wondering, Greg, the co-founder of the Sensualist Society (of which I am the other co-founder).  and the Greg who fantasizes about taking a nap in a pile of freshly laundered clothing while flying in an airplane. But *not* the Greg who quoth _The Raven_ in a mask and cape on a public stairway in Florence, Italy.  That's another Greg who is also often 'into' very interesting and exotic things.  Right now he's literally 'into' Korea -- where he teaches and has astonishing adventures.

1863,Cancer,"       okay, so if you have been wondering where I have gone, this is a recap of what my life has been like the last month. I've been working about 15 hour days for a whole month and half (with no end in sight).. I am currently working on the design of a new elementary school, a 500 sq.ft. add on in Rancho Cucamonga, another 500 sq. ft. add on in Ontario, and a patio/deck cover addition in Upland. Oh yes...the pain of trying to start your own business while you are still working full time. I hope all this is worth it in the long run, that I can have my own successful architectural practice doing residential and commericial work.. which eventually will need to designing of mixed-use development projects. I am also in the process of registering my own company to make it a legitimiate business with tax benfits and all that. So ladies and gentlemen, it's time to jump on the Jeremy Train. Hop on board to a prosperous future!!!!! okay, maybe not dramtic. But I want to clear enough money so my wife and I can start having little Jeremy's... Do you know how much it costs to have kids?!??! god damn!!! Anyways...as soon as next year starts, I'll start working on my own addition to our house, and hopefully I can get our add on published in Dwell!! oh yeah..aiming low for now. Give me another 10 years my ass will be in architectural record biatches!!!          "
1864,Scorpio,"             This to me was the best episode yet! With the dating couples ending their losing streak, and a proper, fun Roadblock and an even choice for Detour. The only sad thing was that the photo album is short of any good pictures. Boo the editors! Give me the photos, and I'll pick out the good ones for you...  Ok, so the teams left the pit stop in Buenos Aires. Brandon & Nicole got stuck in the mud, and Charla & Mirna, thinking they were friends, stopped to get them help. Charla , in the process, got electrocuted by an innocent looking fence. Poor her! The first betrayal: Charla & Mirna go on a different path. Brandon & Nicole, a few feet behind them, don't even bother honking to warn them...  At the airport, Brandon & Nicole found that all the counters were closed, and they decided to try to call for information. The earliest flight, at 9.10am, was full. The next flight, they thought, was at 10.30am. Everyone queued at the Argetina Airlines counter, but Marshall & Lance decided to go out and investigate. This I have to give them props for. Unless you have no time left, do not be satisfied with what you have. Charla & Mirna followed suit, and hearing that there was a 9.40 flight, ran to a ticketing counter just across the hall, lining before Marshall & Lance. Jim & Marsha helped Brandon & Nicole get tickets, which again violated Nicole's promise to help Charla & Mirna get tickets. In the end, Charla & Mirna, and a very lucky Colin & Christie, without Christie's help, got on to the 9.10 flight.         With that, the teams made their way to Bariloche, Argentina one by one, in 4 seperate flights. They were supposed to find the mayor of the place, but surprise, surprise, there's no picutre of him in the photo gallery. Anyway, from there, the clue directed them to a chocolate factory. Their task there was to chomp through 11000 chocolates to find 1 of 20 with a white centre. To me, and a few teams, this sounded like an easy, almost pleasurable task. However, people almost puked at the amount of chocolate they had to wolf down. I think it wouldn't have been a problem for Mr. Sweet tooth here, but I really haven't eaten that much at one go... So who knows? Charla proved that she was a little monster by zipping past Colin to receive a clue from her dwarf friend. How cute, or rather, coincidental.         Ok, so they head to a mountain thingy where they had to choose between 'Rough Riding' or 'Smooth Sailing'. Nobody chose rough riding but it was a ride down a rough hill that is nothing scary, but slow. To me, the fear of falling down on a rough slope and feeling pain is much more than the fear of heights. Smooth sailing required the teams to go parasailing! Well, all the teams had fun!         After the parasailing was the pit stop. A little island connected to the main piece of land by a strip of shallow water... You know that kind of dreamy thing... Kami & Karli went temporarily blind and swam across insted of walking. But other than that, nothing happened. Aand Jim & Marsha were eliminated, if you were wondering...         "

1867,Cancer,"           As she sits on her couch after being awake for an hour, anxiousness and overwhelment take over her body. Sitting and watching tv just didn't sound too much like a good time. She needed to start her day, but couldn't without this call.   Ring, ring.... as her heart plummented to her stomach in hope of hearing his voice, she picked up the phone in no other to her a pause followed by a high pitched voice pernouncing every syllable wrong in the name. In the middle of their sentence, she hangs up in dissapointment of this expected call. Five more of these calls and she just couldn't take it, she had to hear his voice; and she did.   After finally talking to this guy, she made plans to be with him the whole day, which she did do. However, this day was different for her, but she didn't exactly know why. Moodiness had swung through her after his first jokingly comment and all she wanted to do was cry. Her thoughts of paranoia controlled her, while little voices were speaking 'make it stop, you know nothing is wrong, why are you doing this?' She couldn't help herself at this point though, her emotions took the lead.  Throughout the whole night, she was up and down and didn't know where to start or where to even end, she needed help from this guy to make her find her way. After a whole night of struggling to stay at the top, to stay completely satisfied by him, it finally ended, with, of course, the winner on top.   She laid in his arms comfortable as could be and all she could think about was 'why worry? He's all yours.' Every day people learn a valuable lesson, but today, today it meant something to her. Moodiness shouldn't control feelings or emotions, she learned, but you're brain and heart combined should, if it feels right, it is right, if he chose you, you're it.   With this thought and with the relaxation of her body compressed in his arms, she just watched him and looked him in his eyes. She saw his sparkle and thereafter felt butterflies fluttering in her stomach. She slowly laid her head back down with a smile, thinking, 'I could stay like this forever.' With that sparkle in his eyes, she knew he had just helped her find her way.   And that voice that truely started her day, ended it with a kiss goodnight.   Funny because fairy tales can happen to you every single day.   Muah Kati         "

1870,Sagittarius,"             Yeah, I went to go see that movie on Friday, and ironcially I'm making this blog entry 'the day after tomorrow' from the POV of it being Friday. I know it sounds stupid, shut up. It was a good movie, and one that I'll probably be adding to my DVD collection (along with the 3 others I've seen so far this summer).  The day after tomorrow is also when I start summer school. That goes until the 18th from 7:30 to 12:45 every day, but I get credit for an entire semester course (Speech), so I'm not complaining. At least I don't have baseball to worry about this week in addition to summer school.         "
1871,Leo,"       Drew's here.   I like Mike...every quote that I hear from him amazes me. The one that Ryan posted rules to all get-out.  I have a few problems in my life, just like everyone else. Just the other day though, while thinking through them, I really have tried to shift my views on them. In my life my main problems that I have to deal with, the only things that I think about daily, are 1. God, and, 2. Katie. I looked at my faith, and lack of, as a problem, and I looked at my relationship, and lack of, with Katie as a problem, but I don't want to anymore. I realize how much of a blessing it is having these problems in my life. I'd rather be worried about my relationships with God, and with her, than be worried about anything else. I've even begun to believe that my problems are enviable. If everyone had a problem with their perceived lack of faith. If only someone had such a great friend in their life that they'd worry about their relationship with them as much as I do. I don't want to look at my problems as problems anymore. I want to look at them as blessings, even though I don't want to stop improving, so that I don't even have anything to be perceived as problems anymore. I know it's not possible to not have problems, but it's the essence of faith to believe that it does impossible things.          "
1872,Gemini,"             Uh, yeah, it's been a while since I've written anything. What's been going on?  Well, work mostly.  Oh and I also moved last week...fifteen blocks from where I was before.  Which is great.  But I've been completely consumed with reading another blog, one called 'My War: Fear and Loathing in Iraq', written by an infantryman stationed in Mosul.  It is absolutely riveting--it is blunt, sarcastic, funny, sentimental, intelligent, honest...I can't seem to tear myself away from it.  And I'm not the only one--so many other people check in everyday to see if he's written anything, and if he hasn't, everyone starts to get worried, myself included, since as of this post, he hasn't posted either.  It makes me feel a little more connected to my brother, Tim, by reading what it's 'really like' over there.

(this is not a personal attack this is just a hypothetical question for the sake of the debate) HIM (4:54:42 PM): if we are all supposed to be equal...why is my tax rate twice of yours ME (4:54:56 PM): I don't know... and I don't think its fair either ME (4:55:05 PM): its the government HIM (4:55:06 PM): in our govt...I am actually punished for being more productive ME (4:55:10 PM): not the little people ME (4:55:18 PM): yes, you are ME (4:55:38 PM): you are not making a good point here for me wanting to be more productive~~~ and it went on...

1877,Cancer,"           It's now the following weekend from my first entry, and while I have been working on my site, I don't feel I've done anywhere near enough work on it. I have been playing around with the colours: what was once a very dark grey site is now dark blue. I'm not 100% sure that it suits me, but I've used an external CSS style sheet, so if I want to change one of the colours, the whole site will automatically update (I love technology).  I've just got myself one of them IP forwarding sub-domains. It's a little application runs as a service in the background on my computer. Every 3 hours it checks my IP address, and updates the server to reflect this change. From now on, anyone that wants access to my machine can use the following URL (I'll have to keep my firewall updated):   urlLink http://theworldofdan.no-ip.com/   In addition to the IP thingy I've also installed two music tracking plug-ins for Windows Media Player. One of them offers a better website with music tracking features, while the other is better for content (i.e. a dynamic signature for the forum, XML of my recent tracks, JavaScript I can use on this site, etc..). Together they should draw quite an interesting picture of the music I listen to.  Anyway, I'd best get on with my work, I'm about to transfer some of the pages from the old site to the new, then add some new ones (namely: music, web cam, contact me, guest book, etc..). If I feel I've done enough, I'll launch tonight and finish off during the week *fingers crossed*.          "

1880,Aquarius,"                 I have so much on my mind; I dont know where to begin. Ive been sick for the last few days... well since Friday to be exact. That was the day that I started my new meds; guess what, my stomach did not appreciate them. A bad reaction, not actually called allergic, but went back to the doctor today, and they suggested I stop that medication and just eat and drink what was tolerated. It sucks. Ive been sick to my stomach all weekend. I was finally able to eat with out being sick. Luckily.  Still have a headache and stomach pain though. Who would have known? Ive never had stomach problems with my meds. Oh well.   Ive been really emotional. Im off the Effexor. I think I am doing well. C., well he always cheers me up. I love being with him (even though it is online) and just thinking about him. My mood just went from about 4 to about 9.999999 just typing this message about him. Im so in love. I just hope my heart doesnt get ahead of myself on this one. I only wish to be happy more times than I am sad. &#61514;  Im watching a movie on lifetime, so my thoughts may be a little distracted, Im writing during commercials cuz I want to go to bed in the next half hour. Well, about C., I love him so much. Lately my heart, body and soul have ached for him so much. I dont understand how I can be so in love with a man that I have never met, but I believe in love, and I know that he and I will give all that we have to make each other happy. He seems so open to my needs, and to the fact that I am not perfect. I am a perfectionist though, and that makes it hard for me to accept that my life isnt. I want things to be as close to perfect as they can be. I do know that bad things and sadness will be in my life though. I have to accept that to get better.   I dont know how much longer I can live here with my grandmother. The negativity gets to me. I dont know how someone can be so negative. I know I do that to myself, but Ive never that I can recall, tried to be so negative to others. Ive always tried my hardest to make others happy. That is what makes me happy. I love to give myself to others, just is seems most people in my life take advantage of it. My whole family does. The only two people...  well three people... that havent are D, my daughter, C, my fianc, and S, my best friend. I guess my other best friend J, hasnt either, but Im not sure where I stand with her. Im working on trying to get up the courage to help her, because I will have to heal from this too. I want her to be happy.  So, this week I have lots to do. I will go to partial 3 days this week. I have a class I am attending on Wednesday about childrens behaviors, and will also go shopping.  And I have to write the invitation for my fianc, and also get the applications and get them filled out for housing. Not my first choice for wanting to live, but I have to get out of here. I dont know how I will survive but I know I can be strong until C. gets here. I dont live living alone; I dont think I ever have. I have always wanted my family to be there. I cant wait to finally feel as if my family is complete. I cant wait to be wed. I think it has always been my dream, and I cant believe that soon, it will become a reality.  I cant wait to give my love to him, and receive that same love back.  They way he looks at me makes me feel so special its as if the miles that we are apart, arent really there.   Life is scary though. I dont know why I ever changed my mind about living life, but I am glad I did. I wish I could help those that dont feel that way. How do you help someone that really has no reason to live though? How do you help someone that feels no love? I think love is the greatest thing on earth. First the love of my daughter was the best thing that ever happened to me. It got me thru the first 2-3 years after her birth. She made me happy, everything she did, seemed so perfect. Then, she got an attitude. I realized I couldnt live on her to make me happy. I had to, and have to find the happiness within myself. What makes me happy? A beautiful day, talking with friends, writing, both here and my poetry. My dreams of the future make me happy. C. makes me happy. Knowing Im alive makes me feel happy. Im looking for more things to find my happiness in, and I know one day, I will find them but for now... its is time for me to take care of me, and get some beauty rest..  Tomorrow is another day.                  "

1882,Capricorn,"                 I’ve been musing lately on whether television, as a whole, is good or bad. It’s rather a complicated topic, and I think, in a way, both answers are correct. Television has the capability to deliver news of current events almost instantaneously, and to increase our knowledge with things like The History Channel, and PBS. I don’t think it is always true that a picture is worth a thousand words, but in some cases it certainly is and television can do that job. Good movies can prompt discussion, makes us laugh, and capture and idea, thought, or character in image and sound. A good movie can be a work of art. That’s the good part of the television. But our own corruption can turn what could be good into a source of downfall. We fill movies today with the baseness of our nature. With violence and immodesty. We, in our laziness, spend so much time at the television, that we forget how to think for ourselves. Our attention span lessens exceedingly. The importance and impact of the written word fades into the distance. In that respect, television is a crime. This certainly is an interesting topic. I believe there’s a book written about a slightly similar topic, called  Amusing Ourselves to Death , by Neil Postman. Perhaps I’ll put it on my ever increasingly longer ‘To Read’ list.       "

We checked out a fairly big club called Joy, with an amazing dancer on stage, we dribbled all night long, pretty pricy gawping session though as drinkies came in at over €10, :o(  From Madrid I am goin back to London for Semana Santa and then back to Barca for Steffen's last week, gonna be emotional, I will be the last one left standing!  Trying to work out which sights and sounds to experience in the last 5 days so should be pretty hardcore.  Apart from that I have managed to secure me a job at UBS for the summer which is ace, it looks like Constance has got a job lined up with Merrill Lynch, Bee Bee is working at an Italian bank and Steffen has an interview with JP Morgan, if Tim joins the team (and working as a cashier does not count Tim & Ulli) then I think we will be a fully fledged bunch of capitalist bastards.

1887,Aquarius,"       My sister-in-law had an embroidered pillow which rested on her white loveseat which sat in an area off to the side of her kitchen in her former house.  The pillow said, in green thread, 'Bloom Where You're Planted' and of course had simple, colorful flowers sprouting underneath the words.  The first time I saw this pillow, I thought 'What a great saying.'  After 3 eye-opening, ego-blasting years in a teaching position that drove me to see a therapist, a move to a new city, a new job, and lots of downtime, I can now see the sunlight.  The cloud which followed me around all my life, much like the dust cloud that follows PigPen from Charlie Brown, has lifted.  The weather is not always clear, it rains and storms still, but mostly there are sunny days.  I've moved to Richmond to start over and when I first moved here I was so excited and thrilled to begin again and to do it right this time.  Well, 6 months into living here, I was not happy.  The cloud was back, my apartment was a shambles, and I hated waking up to go to work every morning.  I was obsessed with New York City and sad that I could not afford to move there or to London, or anywhere.  Then I began to repeat and reflect on that pillow in my sister-in-laws kitchen.  And while I'm not ready for blooming, at least for now, I think I'll germenate.  And I'm sure, with all this sunlight, a stem will form.   Next Time  Ginko trees live 1,000 years. Eating the leaves will clear you brain. When I heard about them, I thought of my mother, how much I would like to sit under one with her in the ancient shade, nibbling the flesh, the stem, the central vein.  ~Naomi  Shihab Nye           "

1889,Sagittarius,"        A new friend  My girls don't get visitors at our house very often.  Once we had a pool party to celebrate the end of summer and four girls came over.  That was a lot of fun and it kept both of my girls entertained for the entire afternoon.  Last night we had another such special occasion.  Kala has teamed up for a pumpkin decorating project at school, so Jenny came home with us after school yesterday.  What a great time we all had decorating two pumpkins and turning it all into a jester with a miniature puppet of himself.  Kala and Jenny came up with the idea and I added my idea of the puppet.  Two pumpkins stacked on top of each other with a mini-me stuck onto a chopstick, jutting out from the bottom pumpkin.  It really turned out nicely.  What was the nicest of all though, was working with the girls to put it all together.  And then, having all three girls running around the house, chasing each other, blowing bubbles and creating general havoc.  We had such a good time together.  And on a school night!

1890,Capricorn,"              urlLink Matt's Livejournal.   After our meeting yesterday we had a conversation about the topic that we have beaten to a bloody pulp.  It was about our relationship.  And its funny how both of us beat around the bush when we talk about it.  I really don't have a clear picture of his feelings towards me.  I never have the courage to ask.  But I know my feelings towards him.  Well, I think I do.  But I never have the courage to say it.  Maybe its an even-steven deal where I won't tell him in exact words how I feel until he tells me how he feels.  I think I like him.  I think he's one of the greatest people in the world that I have met.  I really don't know why he still talks to me.  He is so much better in almost everyway.  He gets high SAT scores.  He's going to Japan as an exchange student into one of the best Japanese schools.  The Emporer went there.  He has this and that.  Yet, he still talks to me.  And I think he still expresses ideas that he is interested in me.  But why?  He can find so many other people that are better than me.  Richer, smarter, quicker, wittier, more awesome, better violinists, better conversationalist.  Its weird how he still talks to me.  For whatever reason.  Or maybe he's doing this until he leaves and in which he'll never speak to me again.  I don't know which would be worse; him not speaking to me now or him not speaking to me when he leaves.  Both are pretty bad.  I don't know.  Its all very complicated.  And sometimes I wish I didn't beat around the bush as much.  Sometimes I wish I had enough courage to just dive to the heart of the matter and end it right then.    The whole day that we spent together, I felt that I was being so boring.  He said afterwards online that I was a different person in real life than I am online.  I don't know if he was saying that he liked my online personality more or something else.  All he has seen thus far is my online personality.  This was the first time we met.  And it was so scary.  Stressful.  Maybe we should meet again and talk about these issues in person.  It'll be more stressful but things will be solved.  What do I want?  I don't know.  Wha tdo I expect?  I don't know.  I don't know anything and that bothers me.         "
1891,Scorpio,"               Freedom of Speech?    I chanced upon this Blog, as how web surfing usually goes, by clicking link to link to link.  It's a page about this lady in the States, who     got  urlLink fired   for what she wrote on her Blog.     What's the state of freedom of speech now? Internet laws are still in their infancy stage - can she sue them for firing her? (Joy? Any comments?)  It makes me wonder, could I get into trouble for what I'm posting right now? If that's the case, my Blog'll never be able to fully express what I think or feel 'coz *gulp* Big Brother's watching...it's Self-Censorship at work...  This sucks doesn't it?  Anyways, I read  urlLink  what she wrote  about her boss and co-workers. It seemed innocent enough, a standard rage-against-the-machine rant.   IMHO, some people are just wayyyyyyyy too sensitive. I mean c'mon, it's not like the whole world gets along right? We all need room to express our pent-up pissed-offness...  The sad thing is, I think the machine won.  urlLink  dooce.com   has been abandoned, although you can still read the  urlLink archives .

The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution    Of course, this means that the   government   can't interfere. But it seems like nosy co-workers can. hmmm....  Oh wells. No big deal right?

1892,Aquarius,"       i've become quite fascinated with blogs this last month or so (i know some people have probably had theirs for like years!). to imagine that someone would take time out from their day just to let others know what they've done, how they're feeling or ask for an opinion! what makes these people wanna do this? a few of my friends say that this is a good way to vent (hence the website address) and i thought to myself, 'man, i hardly have time to vent in my own journal, for MY OWN sake, let alone sit and type it out for everyone else to read.' but then i figured that maybe the reason why i'm so apprehensive sometimes about sitting and typing out my every emotion on microsoft word (how doogie howser is that?) is because i know that i'm the only one who's gonna read it anyhow (until i've passed on that is...ok morbid!) so what's the rush, what's the point? so i can read it 5 years later and reflect on the ass that i made of myself over a boy? or rediscover the innocence of the childhood that i can no longer have? but here i am, ready to type for all of you so i won't be alone in my reflections. thanks for logging on...

1894,Pisces,"                 . a perfect moment .  the banks of the creek behind the cemetery which borders the back of our circle overflowed by fifty and a hundred feet today.  Lynn saw it on her run, and we all went down to see.    inevitably we started to wade, and as the children recognized how transgressive the moment was -- we started to frolic.   I'm always reminded that I'm in a perfect moment when I see Jaelyn Running.   She has a funny and completely authentic gesture of whirling one arm -- at full length when she's running in complete abandon.  She doesn't even recognize it when she's doing it -- and can't really make it 'pretend' to happen.    So today as she ran through the Knee Deep water -- splashing everywhere -- Lynn running and yelling too, Woo Hoo -- and the arm started going --   I had a flash of recognition that we had found one of THOSE moments.  A moment where all the rules go hazy and all the background floats away -- where you are completely and utterly HERE -- RIGHT NOW -- with EACH OTHER.  I flopped under the water myself (brrr!) and then attempted to cross the creek.  The raging creek was at my armpits and despite all my (substantial) girth fighting against the creek --> I got SWEPT AWAY.   I grapped tufts of grass and pulled myself to the submerged shore.    Addison and Jaelyn ran freely and wildly.  Splashing purposely to sit down up to their necks, climbing atop an island tree or water main cap.  We waved to the maintenance workers who smiled at us from their mowers and bulldozers.  We tried to be subdued when mourners drove by, but it was hard.    The world was overflowing and we happened to be right in the flow of it.                "

Also, I believe Kerry and Edwards are putting way to much effort into their image, sure, that will work a little bit, but if they talk more about what they are going to do instead of just being 'not Bush', they would get a lot farther. There is a very large Anti-Bush group out there, so that may be what they are going for, but if your just voting Anti-Bush, why not vote independant, or not vote at all.  I am also not a Bush fan either, he has made his fair share of mistakes while in office, some of the major things ive noticed in the recent weeks, before we are even done in Iraq, he starts asking if Iran was involved in 9/11. He needs to finish one thing before jumping into something else.

When I was at World Youth Day, Alexandro {a guy we met there...}  called me 'the Smiley girl'.  At the time I thought that was an insult, but now I see that it was really an extremely nice complement {well, he didn't mean it that way, he DID mean it as an insult but hey...} I wish I could give people little slices of sunshine, and rain showers with a little thunder on the side... maybe a few hugs and a kiss, a years supply of friendly smiles from people you don't even know, and perhaps then all people could be happy like me.

1905,Libra,"           Another trip to the Western Highlands and in particular it's capital Mt Hagen has been completed.  After driving up incident free on Friday, working Saturday at the school setting up computers and then having a lazy Sunday at the Hotel I actually thought this trip would pass by without any eventualities happening - comparing it that is to my last trip anyway (see  urlLink Highlands Hwy Survivor ).  Then Monday morning when it was time to turn tail and head for home, George (my boss and travel partner) told me first we had to go and pay our respects at the funeral of one of our work colleague's brother who had died.   Paul's brother had passed away in Moresby on Friday, from Asthma complications or bronchitis or something like that.  Paul and his brother are from Mt Hagen, so Paul went down to Moresby from Lae and retrieved the body and returned to Hagen with it on Sunday.  Monday was set as the first day of the funeral, which would last three days until the body would be interned on Wednesday.    Once George had told me that we were going to a funeral, I changed into some semi-decent clothes that I brought along for the trip and George picked me up.  We arrived at the bottom of the driveway up to Paul's clan's area with a group of about 20 other people.  Most of these were people George knew and there was the obligatory handshaking of everyone by me as I was introduced.   At this stage I realised that wearing a shirt, a pair of trousers and my doc martins -  my usual work attire - was considerably overdressing for the occasion.  Funeral's it seems in PNG - or at least the western highlands - don't have the same sort of unwritten dress code that exists in Australia and I imagine all the other western countries.  I was standing with a group of mourners dressed in the usual PNG highlands attire, which basically consists of the pickings from second-hand clothes stores (the next time you throw that heap of clothes into the St. Vincent's de Paul clothes bin outside the local church, bear in mind that it will end up being worn for another good couple of years all over PNG, until it finally falls apart), mixed and matched in all sort of unusual combinations.  There was even one elderly bloke, who was wearing a nice tweed jacket, elbow patches and all, combined with  as gras  (arse grass - a bunch of leaves covering your arse, it is traditional highlands dress) hanging from underneath the back of the jacket, dangling above his bare legs.   After all the handshaking was completed the group proceeded to slowly walk up the drive.  As we got closer I could hear what I would describe as rhythmic wailing coming faintly from the direction of the ceremony.  We stopped as the wailing was getting louder, a respectable distance from the proceedings and one of our members took up a song.  After a time others joined, then everyone was singing in the local language.  To best describe what the singing sounded like, think of a Aboriginal song in chorus. I am not sure of the details of the song, but no doubt it was to do with sorrow.  The group moved on.  My doc martins by this stage were slipping through mud, caused it seems by the combined effects of heavy rain the night before and hundreds of people trampling over the same spot.  The ceremony area was obscured by village buildings along the whole of the path to it. I may have not been able to see proceedings but I could certainly hear it.  Similar songs were being sung as the one our group was singing which in turn was mixed with wailings and stomping of feet.  We entered the clearing and I finally got to see what was happening. The area was about the size of an Olympic swimming pool with the edge lined with onlookers who I assumed to be members of the clan. At one end of the clearing a group of people were standing around a effigy of the body. This was the family group and ones causing most of the wailing. To the side of the mourners, were the warriors. About a hundred strong lined up into ranks. They had painted their bodies with mud and brought along their weaponry, including spears, bows & arrows and axes. Most of them were wearing traditional dress of as gras and the like, but some just wore their St Vinnies best.  They were marching around the area, chanting and singing their warrior songs to make sure that the other side knew that they had to accept the spirit of the deceased or they would come in and force them to accept it.  Our group came into the area and solemnly walked around the same circuit as the warriors, all the while still singing the same song.  We encircled the mourners, coming face to face to them and their grief.  This ceremony also goes by the name of  bikpela kry  (big cry), and now I understood.  It was expected for you to show huge emotion. This meant that everyone there was wailing, crying, blabbing and basically overcome with grief.  It was a shock to see Paul who I always thought of a tough guy, letting go, with tears streaking his cheeks.  He saw me and beckoned me over, so that he could hug me and I could offer my sympathy.   Despite everyone else breaking down, there was no way that I could turn on the waterworks for someone I didn't even know.  I looked around to see if I was the only person who was like this and I saw George standing there looking like me, as if he was a bystander at a car accident - intrigued at the sight, but not emotional.  Later he told me that he has a real problem crying in public, understandable I said, most guys in the western world are exactly the same.   Up close, the effigy of Pauls brother, which should have apparently been the actual coffin, looked more like a coat rack than a person.  It consisted of a branch cut from a tree jammed in the ground with a hat sitting on top and a Hawaiian shirt on a coat hanger, both items which belonged to Paul's brother.  Where the face should have been was a photograph of him.  This was the centre for the grief and anyone new who arrived made there way to this, to touch it and weep.  It was unfortunate that the actual coffin could not be there, instead we got what looked like an unstuffed scarecrow.  The reason apparently that the coffin could not be there was because being hot weather, they wanted to keep it at the Mt Hagen morgue until time of burial.  I am not sure if this is correct or not, but it was the explanation I got.   While in the inner circle of grievers, the warriors still marched around the outside.  After a while they changed from marching in ranks to an attack mode. Racing around in a hunched stance, spears raised, arrows pulled tight on their bows and axes ready.  A couple of complete circuits were completed while in this mode, before the inner group that I was in, parted back from the coat rack.  The warriors now, with their lungs pumping out a war cry, came around behind and through the group to gather up the effigy.  They carried this aloft and down into a hut at the end of the grounds.  This signalled that the first part of the funeral was over.   Everyone now relocated to another part of the clearing and formed a circle.  The important people sat on seats but most people including me either sat on the grass or stood.  Firstly the formalities were done, which meant that someone explained how the guy died, when, where etc.  Then others got up and expressed their condolences.  Then finally as in the other time I have witnessed one of these events at the compensation ceremony of my last trip here, the talkfest started and every topic people wanted to air was raised.  There is one thing to be said about highlanders, they love to talk.  These talkfest's are very orderly, no one interrupts anyone, everyone can get there turn at the topic they want to discuss, or to readdress and put there spin on a topic already raised.  There was only problem for me, I had no idea about what they were saying, only picking up the general English word every once in a while, and I was sitting directly in the hot noon sun, which I later found turned me a bit pink.   George and Me took our leave at an appropriate time and headed back on the long trip down the Highland's highway to Lae.  It was a late leaving, which made the time we got back about 9.30.  The trip after dark turned into a bit of a nightmare for me.  I was given the reins after Kainantu, and got the pleasure of driving through the dark.  Fun fun fun.  One of our headlights was not working and road is a shocker even if you drive during the day with potholes appearing as numerous as holes in Swiss cheese. Also the numerous trucks heading up to the highlands don't bother turning off their hi-beam, making it virtually impossible to see anything as they pass.  Anyway we made it back safely, though in hindsight next time I will insist on staying the night in Goroka.          "
1906,Sagittarius,"       We are now officially home owners!  We had the keys to the house before everything was final and started working... We started by cleaning everything and painting the bedrooms.  In the main bedroom, we ripped out the closet and Lars has since built a new one and ordered new sliding doors.  Both of us will have a room for an office. We spent one beautiful Sunday afternoon mowing the lawn and trimming the hedges, but the garden and lawn are definitely phase 2.   This group of pictures are about a month old now, and since then we've painted the living room and all of the wood floors have been resanded.  Apparently there is no kitchen right now, Lars has ripped it all out in preparation for our NEW kitchen (I'm currently traveling for business, so I got out of having to remove wallpaper--yay)... and we get new windows in a few weeks.

1909,Taurus,"       Not long after I moved to Australia, a local news program featured a segment concerning a woman in a small town who was forced by the city to erect a fence around her property. Neighbors had complained about the unsightly condition of her yard. Negative words were tossed back and forth. Feelings were hurt. To add insult to injury, this woman not only had no choice as to the fence's appearance, but also had to pay for it!   Ok, perhaps some yards could really do with a fence to hide the stockpile of garbage collected over the years, but truly, I've never seen more fences surrounding houses for seemingly no apparent reason, than what line the streets of suburban Brisbane.   Some enclosures are quite remarkable as to their ornamentation, and others, not much more than the white washed picket fences of days gone by. Regardless of their appearance, why on earth do so many Brisbanites choose to hide behind these barriers anyway? Are the owners embarrassed to show the world their undie and bra laden Hill's Hoists or Uncle John's rusted out ute? Or is there another darker reason? One that has passed beyond the realm of premeditated acts and lapsed into the subconscious? Are Brisbanites afraid of their neighbors?   Let's face it, this country was after all founded by a rather huge lot of casted out convicts. And though ancestors of the original settlers would like you to think otherwise, not all prisoners exiled to this region were so because they simply stole a loaf of bread to feed their family (just ask my husband - that's what he thinks!)! I would hazard a guess that most original settlers, convicts, military, and civilians alike, were somewhat afraid. Here they were in the middle of no where, thousands of miles from family and friends, finding themselves neighbors with thugs, burglars, murderers and thieves. Is it really so hard to believe that possibly this fear and isolation has over time become so ingrained into the subconscious of Australians as to actually effect their lifestyle ? Could the rows and rows of fences simply be a silent scream to all who will take noticed - 'We need to feel safe and protected!'   Perhaps not. It is just as likely that the owners only wish to display their wealth and afford their family and land with some protection from the elements, as well as the occasional hooligan. I would like them to take note though - a 6 foot high, solid cement fence does not instill in others a warm and fuzzy feeling, no matter how beautiful. My recommendation? (For what it's worth) tear down the fences, say G'day to passerby's, and head down to the local bakery, buy a loaf of bread and share it with your neighbor.            "
1910,Leo,"         after waiting what seemed years but was really only 16 hours i finally get another turn! i love my boys dearly but they are computer nazi's! they don't get that from me. :) to be fair they aren't allowed to use the computer at their house but  come on!!  i'm done ranting for now.   there is so much that wants to come rushing out i don't know where to start! how about a glimpse into how i really do enjoy the simple things? let me start by giving you a bit of back round. i live in a urban apartment . i really enjoy where i am and it was a block from work . the building i live in is a funky old place with big windows, pocket doors and claw foot tubs. the downfall to this place is the apt. sizes available. most are single and double studios with one 1br and a couple 2 br. thrown in for fun. i was lucky enough to get one of the double studios on the corner so i have cross ventilation. mine is also one of the few that haven't been butchered to make it modern. it has been hellishly hot for a week or so making my world uncomfortable. (i dislike being too hot or cold) this morning i woke up to slightly over cast skies. it is cooler and strangely quiet for a saturday. after i started the coffee i moved the areo bed and got out my outdoor folding chair. (my oldest son was still asleep on the only place besides the bed to sit) as i sat down i had a happy feeling. something about the day and the chair reminded me of camping. i got a goofy smile on my face and basked in the good feeling.

1911,Aquarius,"       'Flashes of life'  The winds blew the memories of the dead The past flashes like a train Emotions swelled to pain, sadness and joy Familiar faces carved into the graves Something emerged triumphant  The icy cold swept up in a torrent devouring the warm and lush air Like a man frozen with no feelings, thoughts nor love           "
1912,Pisces,"             Well, the above phrase was uttered by MOGpac Athletics team captain Matt after the Pac lost a crucial dodgeball match to the tournaments first ever (at least from what I've seen) All-Girl team, and I think that sums up last nights D-ball performance. We managed to win one, but we suffered nothing but losses the entire evening.  About this loss to women, I put the blame squarely on the shoulders of G, The Kidd, and our newest player, the utterly useless (yet enjoyable to have around) Lurch, who saw this match as an opportunity to 'play nice' and meet some girls. Since our team has girls, one of which is my own girlfriend, I felt no need to pull punches and eliminated several girls without mercy (and without injury). Matt I dont have to worry about as he doesn't respect women, Brandt, who played sleeveless and will never hear the end of it, is so young that he is still in his 'girls are yucky' phase, and Irene and Robin ARE girls. My other three mates, however, we're thinking with their willies and we were served up a big hulking plate of defeat. THANKS GUYS. Of course I mean this all in good fun.  However, I must say, I had a ton of fun, even though weeknight dodgeball can be quite tiring as opposed to Saturday Mornings, in which you are rested and raring to go. I played all right, I guess. I think I played better than last time, but I was the victim of several bad calls and even got hot under the collar at one point with the ref, which is very unlike me (i was proven right though and allowed back). As a protest, I have decided to be the Brock Lesnar of D-ball and retire at the tender age of 31 to possibly return to my backyard wrestling career. If the money is right, I might return to D-ball, even though it has become a corporate monster of camera crews and Red Bull endorsements. I am about the GAME, the SPORT of Dodgeball.  Special thanks to Pete and Damon for no-showing at the last minute, leaving us short. Cheers, bastards. Also special thanks to G who brought the driest, least chewy, Chewy Granola bars ever. Asshole!  Anyhow, the night before was spent partially at the Birdcage, with me in the producers chair recording Brandt's new rythmn guitars for THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE, which had to be changed in light of Charle's recent bass revisions. B worked fast and with great skill and the night breezed by. I was only there a few hours, but left a very happy producer knowing that the opening track of the album will have the kick I want it to have. Brandt also threw in a few new brushstrokes which brought later parts of the song to life. Well played, guy.  B also posted the new version of 1956 for the others to hear and while we havent heard from Ash about it, Charles really was into it. In some instances, he couldnt tell the difference between his basslines and my new basslines, which to me is a HUGE compliment! We might get him to tweak some of his bass because I used different drums in certain places now in the song and he feels he could tighten his stuff up. Bring it on, I say.  I'm leaving for LA on Tuesday and B is off to Europa for a long spell on the 24th, but we're in super shape. The only thread dangling is Peter Saintface, who is mixing like a madman for S-face. We're patient people and he is worth waiting for as we have plenty to do. He's gonna sing two songs and is going to be the exclamation point on this album. To answer some of your E-mails, I have no idea when this record is coming out. Honestly, this is a new band starting basically from scratch and this album is crucial in defining who and what this band is and thus, it has to be perfect to us before you can hear. I love this record and won't sell it short, but damn am I itching to play some gigs with these people!  Tidbits: IDENTITY CRISIS might be the best comic book mini-series since KINGDOM COME. Congrats to my pal Mr. Carlin on editing a potential masterpiece...I just wrapped up Ric Flair's autobiography, which is wonderful, funny and educational when it comes to a business that I love, but have very little knowledge of. Foley's books are a tad better, but this comes close...I count the seconds until new record label PULSEBLACK gets up and running. It's the Die Warzau guys and all of their projects and I'm expecting huge things from them. The new DW songs are amazing...  I'm sure there's more, but the day must begin!  F         "

1914,Sagittarius,"        Tangled Mind  First of all, it was intentional.  I don't buy for one second that the costume malfunctioned.  Janet's a freak, period, end of statement.  Now that that's out of the way...  Realization Number 1: While walking through the sun-drenched streets of South Beach on my lunch break, just barely breaking a sweat in the balmy 68 degrees (are you jealous yet?), I realized that no matter how tough life can be, I always carry a little bit of joy in me.  Realization Number 2: The art to a sexy walk is never looking like you're in a hurry.  You may very well be in a hurry, but your walk should not indicate this.  As long as, with every step, you feel the stride and enjoy the sound of your heel on the pavement, and move into the next long stride, you will be sexy.  Damnit.   Realization Number 3: Weird, misguided thought number 1: While making my way back from my lunch break walk, a man on the street sneezed really loud.  REALLY LOUD.  Echoing through the streets and alleys loud.  Everyone stopped in their tracks to look.  He moved on, and then sneezed again a moment later.  Twisted thought crossed my mind: Is he that loud in bed?  Then my mind meandered to last night, when I heard my neighbors from what must have been a kitchen romp.  Deep throaty moans with an even amount of time between each of them.  At the time, I just wanted to get my little diva into our apartment so I wouldn't have to explain the sounds coming from behind the other door.  But, today my mind wandered back to the sounds.  Such nice sounds.    Maybe they were listening to a Janet Jackson CD after having watched the game.  Diva out.           "
1915,Pisces,             dunno lah..i guess its good we have wide access to media coverage and all..but it still doesnt mean we know everything..with politics you never know. but with what we have at least we can make our own judgement abt what's going on rather than having things rammed down our throat. gulf war..how old were we?

You ever take your car in to get the rear view mirror adjusted and you leave the garage $800 later having been told you need new breaks, a new flex compactor, and a flush and refill of blinker fluid. I didn't know blinkers needed fluid! Fucken assholes...I might as well wear a shirt that says:  'I'm a total asshole and will pay top dollar for nothing because I don't know shit about cars!'

1917,Sagittarius,"            Ok, Good news on my part. On Monday, I finally have an interview with the Theater. This means, that, if hired, I won't have to work in that infernal Bob Evans anymore. The people there are nice, but, no, no more food. Concessions doesn't count, because it's popcorn, and hotdogs. Thats not 'food'.      I don't know what to blog about. I just sat here for five minutes, thinking what to blog about. Hmmmmm........      Nope, nothing's coming to mind. Oh, funny story, that Aaron's already heard, but funny nonetheless. Today at work, the Chinese pony league team came in to eat, all 27 of them, and they sat everywhere. A waitress came up and said, ok, what can I get you to drink? The chinease kids said kjsdj dsjkhfhsdaja jf.....and the waitress said, 'I don't know what the fuck you just said.'       It was so so so so so so so very funny.      Later      p.s.

1918,Capricorn,"                 Here is a poem I wrote a while ago. It's an poor attempt at satire. It's subject matter is more than a little controversial, so if you comment on it, please comment on the poem itself.     The Caveman   By Abigail  “Umfa, umfa, glug, glug,” The caveman walks with heavy trudge.  His hair is tangled, long and black, It also trails right down his back.  He’s stooped and bent and walks along, There is no path to follow long.  He stops, and raises shaggy head, He’s dumb, he just awoke from bed.  He spies a rabbit, tense and shy, He shoots his arrow through its eye.  He grabs his prey with haughty look, He has no fire, it cannot cook.  He’s starved; he eats the bunny raw, And drinks its blood without a straw.  His blood-stained mouth grins stupidly, He is akin to you and me!  He does not talk, just gurgles noise, And on he goes with little poise.  Again he stops at different sight, He sees a girl, whose face shows fright.  “Me the man, you woman mine,” Reluctant, she begins to whine.  He snatches her up by the hair, He means to take her to his lair.  She kicks and screams, and brings a fight, He knocks her out, now all is right.  This man, this mighty caveman, tall, He fathered us, he fathered all!!!       "
1919,Sagittarius,"                 Hey! my weekend was awesome.  Friday- I hung out @ Nic's house with her and Brian...we just hung out and talked for a while.  it was her mom's birthday so we ate cake! lol.  Saturday- I went to Marshall's house and watched School Of Rock (great movie).  It was fun, but then again Marshall's house is always fun! Sunday- I got a call from Mrs. Quindlen.  She asked me if I wanted to go to the Blink-182 concert with Jack, a friend of mine who i've know since 3rd grade from SJC.  I was sooo hapyp and excited, but I wish she had 2 tickets so Marshall could go. :-(.  The I went to Shannon Munsell's graduation party with my family for a little while.  It was pretty boring.  Then Mr. Quindlen drove us to go pick up Jack's friend Henry.  Then we were on our way to take the ferry so that we would get to the Tweeter Center.  When we got there, we met up with Jack's friends, Zac and Dan.  So it was me, Henry, Jack, Zac and Dan all hanging out.  It was so much fun becuase all the guys were sooooo cool.  lol. Great Weekend...Blink-182 and No Doubt rocked my socks. lol I just felt like saying that.

1921,Aquarius,"       The Philippines give into terrorists who are no mre than common dime store street thugs.  The Philippino government now has no credibility on the world stage.

1922,Pisces,"       It’s a claim I made a few posts back and I wanted to talk about what I meant.    I think to own your story, you have to tell stories.   Good news:  anecdotal party banter  does  encourage such telling.  BS sessions which fall under the general headings:   “remember the time when…”   and   “you think that  that’s  bad!…”  are, I think, one of the great vestiges of oral culture left threading through humanity.  I think that this tradition is great – it fits in well with deipnosphistai (below).  I’ll wager that if you know someone who you would say – “So-and-so is a great storyteller.” – that they are experts in the two genres mentioned above.   So my complaint is not that these stories are bad (again, they’re GOOD!) but that they’re insufficient.    Somehow we relish opportunities to swap these stories (which generally affirm collectively held values, demarcate micro-cultural boundaries, and reinforce shared criteria for evaluating humor / art / performance) – but turn to the movies or novels or church or the newspaper – to hear stories that raise and answer the bigger questions of meaning and morality.  We lack, it seems, opportunities to tell  our  stories.  And in some ways, I think, maybe its okay that we don’t always tell our dark stories to just anyone or to everyone.  Most of us tell these stories to a few people and that’s hard enough as it is.  But there’s a middle ground.  Another place.  A point-of-view, a way-of-seeing, a way-of-being – which both enables us to tell the big stories, but also preserves the delicacy of intimacy and the dangers of disclosure.  It’s called:   Fiction.   I’m convinced that honing your skills as a creator of  fiction   is  a way to own your own Story.  And your own stories.    Are you skeptical?  Delighted?  Nonplussed at my rantings? There’s only one good response to reading this blog.  Use your imagination and tell one fiction story today.  To someone.  See what happens to you….  Peace~    "

1928,Pisces,"       bumped into this fragment:    Patience is not waiting passively until someone else does something. Patience asks us to live the moment to the fullest, to be completely present to the moment, to taste the here and now, to be where we are. When we are impatient, we try to get away from where we are. We behave as if the real thing will happen tomorrow, later, and somewhere else. Be patient and trust that the treasure you are looking for is hidden in the ground on which you stand.   - Henri J.M. Nouwen    and it SO reminded me of  urlLink the point that i was talking about from the parable of the stewards .  I've rarely felt such convergence around my spiritual life and its connection to the rest of my life...  and the wierd thing is how its been sustained in so many small and seemingly unconnected ways for the past few weeks.  But on patience for a moment.    last friday Jaelyn, Addison and I went garage saling.  For like four hours.  They were even more into it than I was.    I made them chant the four things we were looking for before and after each sale:   1. balls 2. bats 3. mitts 4. helmets  that way if they saw other stuff - i could say -- enh.  its not on the list.   in the end we bought:   1. a toy bow and arrow 2. two frog puppets 3. a pottery mug.   but when it was time to go home for lunch, Addison was desperate.  We couldn't stop! he insisted.  We hadn't found a helmet.   We have to be patient, I reminded him. It's so hard to be patient isn't it?   We should go to a store. He said.  But I reminded him that waiting for the universe to unfold karma in her time would be much better for us.  We would learn about waiting, we would remember that good things take time.  We would *earn* the helmet.   Ok so i didn't say the stuff about karma.  but i thought it.   And later Jaelyn was feeling impatient for dinner.  She was persevorating on the point.  Daddy, I'm hungry.  When is it going to be ready!?  And so we talked about how it had been hard for Addison, because he was only thinking about that helmet.    Being patient means that we choose to let go of the future possibility.  The thing we want but don't have and focus on something RIGHT HERE.  .  i have, historically, referred to myself as a gypsy.  but suddenly find that i may just be developing some place-roots.  which is freaky and not completely comfortable.  the UTNE reader had an article two issues ago about  urlLink how long it takes to really see something ...  and this idea that patience is a prerequisite to seeing is one that I learned a hundred years ago at the Cabin sitting on a rock in the lagoon.  And one that I tried to learn while I researched my dissertation at a hundred garage sales, but suddenly it feels so big...  such a vast invitation...     "

1930,Aries,"           I must take issue with such a sweeping statement -- I, for one, am not 'culturally set up' to do this.

1933,Cancer,"       church tonight sucked. seeing as pastor is out of town, ____ 'played pastor' and i just left feeling very disappointed in today. it was so redundant and UGH! i am so mad right now. i shouldnt even be writing this. i feel like she was preeching so much and repeating the same things that people started acting like fools so that she would just stop with her redundancy. i also felt like she was rooting for everyone to get drunk in the holy spirit, almost forcefully, so that she wouldnt feel so self concious with a bunch of unimpressed kids staring at her. i walked in completely ready for a touch from God, and left feeling like i should have stayed home. i've never seen such a display of chaos. well, i have.. but this was certainly negative. it seemed to somehow falsify my belief that she was ready to be a pastor. ughhhh!!!  make that TWO flat tires. last week[since its sunday] was VERY trying. and this start does not look good.            "
1934,Libra,"           OK, maybe it is because I have been here a while now, but there are a few things now that are starting to bug me.  So I thought I would have a bit of a whiny session and put all of these pet hates into a list of the top 5.  Let me add first though that these are bearable and it is just me having a whinge.  I will make up a list of the top 5 things that I love just to counter this one, and to let you know it is not all bad.  So anyway here they are counting backwards from 5 down to the real annoyer.   5. Loitering:  OK I might be a hit harsh, seeing as the unemployment level here is very high, but it gets on my nerves how people will just loiter around for a whole day waiting for something to happen.  You go  into town to the shops and you will have to walk past a dozen people just  sitting around chewing Buai, looking at you as if you are today's  entertainment.   If some sort of action happens, ranging from construction workers laying water piping, to a raskol being chased by a security guard and to a preacher spealing out his gospel it will always attract a massive crowd because people have nothing else to do.  Invariably though it is usually men in this category because due to the Melanesian culture the women will be out in their gardens, or down at the market selling there produce.   4. Blackouts:  Power problems are a really big issue here, it seems to be going off and on every other day, which makes it is a massive pain when you are typing away, and the power goes out, and the two hours of database changes you have just done are all gone.  Of course you learn how to deal with this and make sure saving is taken care of, or in my case make sure a UPS is purchased to give you the opportunity to save and shut down.  What is worse though is when you think you are doing the right thing, and save all your docs and files onto the University Staff server, which you were told was backed up, only to find out after the thing dies from the power going off and on that in fact it had not been backed up for 6 weeks, in which time you have created a complete database of computer assets - about 6 weeks worth of work.  Ahhh.  Lucky I am an easy going guy.  If only I could infiltrate the ITS dept and fix their systems up, and teach those no hopers a thing or two.   3. Personal  hygiene:  OK, again I might be being harsh here, as most people live in simple village huts on the edge of towns, but it still doesn't stop the fact that the smell in our department dramatically increases in the afternoon when we are open to all the student enquires.  It is a strong musty odour that permeates throughout the office, seeping into every corner.  I know this as I am about as far away from the front desk as you can get.  In the first weeks that I was working here it made me nauseous and even gave me headaches, such was the combined strength of the dozen or so sweaty students.  I think I have either now grown accustomed to it or perhaps it is the fact that I am now making sure that if it becomes too unbearable I open the louver windows in my little office, in the hope of extinguishing the smell.   2. Dogs:  I used to really like dogs.  Unfortunately the dog tolerance level has now been stretched.  On their own they are great.  But when you get the cocktail of there being masses of them, throwing in the fact they are treated like dirt, mix in copious amounts of doggie hormones running wild - looking for a bit of lovin' - and it's pretty bitter drink to swallow.  Fights break out all the time, anytime.   Howling is started by a single specimen and then the whole place erupts in a communal howl, not good at four in the morning.  Watch where you step or you might be spreading it around all over the sole of you shoe and footpath.   1. Spitting:  It is not hard to work out why this is a pet hate.  I was warned before I went to China, by people and books, that the spitting there was pretty bad.  It was not pleasant, but it was not that bad - though in the mornings the Chinese do get a good hack going trying to clear the sinuses - pleasant.  But now that I have been in PNG I can safely say it is on another level here, in type and quantity.  Here the problem is not only just people spitting on the ground, which happens all the time - can't they just swallow it  - but it is exasperated and made ten times worse by the added combination of Betel Nut (buai) chewing.  With the Betel nut, you get the unsightly look of a massive wad of red being deposited anywhere convenient.  You can tell when it is coming, the cheeks are bulging, and they are looking around for the nearest spot to let loose.  In the centre of towns this is usually in a communal rubbish heap turned unsightly bright red with gallons of spit, add the fly's that gather and this becomes quite unpleasant.  You have to be careful where you go, sit and who to talk to otherwise it could be unpleasant case of you wearing some red stuff.  Personally I have nearly been hit whilst departing from a PMV - always a particularly dangerous time, once those piles of junk are stopped people feel the need to lean out the windows - and have worn some by a drunk guy who wanted to have a conversation with me.  Flecks flew when he talked about what a great relationship PNG and Australia had or how the Maroons were going to win the State of Origin series or some other such  spakman   (pidgin for a drunk guy) talk.  I had to occasionally wipe the stuff from my face.          "

1937,Capricorn,"                 Whenever I’m with little kids I can’t help but remember how I felt when I was their age. I remember a girl who used to babysit me when we lived in Connecticut. I always viewed her as a “big girl”. It’s odd to think that now I’m the “big girl.” And yet it’s also odd to think that in 4 years I’ll be off to college and all that I’ve written in this blog will be the work of a “kid”. I don’t feel like a “kid” at the moment. Well, that’s my first random thought for the day.       "

1943,Aquarius,"       One of the best Gothic poetry sites on the web, in my opinion, is this one:  urlLink http://www.ravensrants.com/index.html   Raven's poetry is brilliant, breaking the gothic poetry stereotype...everyone thinks gothic poetry = poems about death.  Crystal Night  I walked out one crystal night and the air was cold and black every star held bright and true against it's midnight back The moon hung low above the trees as silent as a ghost and I sat there in the fields as frigid as a post This night was so gorgeous just like a movie scene and even the trees kept still to keep my view pristine My mind began to wonder through thoughts about this place It wished to share with someone nature's purest face But around me there was not a soul not a heart to make a sound and I knew I was all alone when I began to look around Then my heart felt empty like the space between the stars I knew the night alone couldn't heal all my scars So with that I began to walking back into the night i knew that I would need someone to help me win this fight So now I must leave this scene until some other time Because until I can share it it's just a song without a rhyme ~RAVEN~ If poetry interests you at all, you must check this site out... even if you are not goth, open your mind and experience something new...

1947,Libra,"                 ...Our Program already in Progress:  Hello friends. I guess this first of all posts should begin with a little about myself. That's easy, the name's Travis. I'm 21, on the brink of 22-dom. I currently reside in the DC area. I've been here for about a month and I think I'll keep it. I'm an engineer and I'm gay. I stand by my opinion that gay engineers make cool engineers, whereas straight engineers make dorks...  That's not meant as a dig to any of you. Making fun of others just makes you feel better about yourself. No seriously... There are some kickass not-completely-devoid-of-social-skills engineers out there. Of the 14 on the east coast... I'm friends with 12.   A little background, you ask? Okay... Born and bred in suburban Connecticut. Had your normal childhood. Shitty at times, lovely the next day. I just had that one thing that made me a little different than all my friends. That one thing that I couldn't talk about for most of my life. But then don't we all. I don't mean to depict my sexual orientation as a sob story by any means. We all have our trials and tribulations and are stronger/wiser for having experienced them. And don't get me wrong I had a loving supportive family, conservative and religious at the crux, but subsequently (and possibly hypocritically) supportive during my coming out.  I had two older siblings, the kind you love to hate, and hate to love, again typical. They are two of the most amazing people I know. I looked up to them so much in my life my neck is still sore. At times I couldn't stand them, at times they'd make me cry, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  And now on to my final family member, my secondary caretaker... TV. I have this long standing opinion that nearly everything I know I've learned from TV. If you yield the power of that beautiful glowing box for good, the world is your oyster. Well maybe not that much, but as Martha would say 'It's a good thing.' Early in my childhood I discovered (no not men, that came a little later), movies. Thank god I was born when I was, 'cause the VCR shaped my life. Look upon this as you wish, but I believe it was genuinely good  Whenever you talk to a gay person, well at least most of the time. They always say, 'I always new I was different.' Which is our way of saying even before I got erections from MTV's 'The Grind,' (Go Eric) I knew somethin' was up. So in order to escape those alienation feelings I entered what I have since dubbed 'my celluloid closet.' Was it healthy, maybe not, but it got me through a lot of years when I wasn't ready to face myself. People often wonder why they didn't know. To a certain extent so do I, but I sure as hell didn't want them to figure it out. Is this why there are so many homosexuals in Hollywood? Is it because we all grow up as actors? Well I played the part well. I didn't go as far as to submerse myself in athletics, but I have gotten to the point where I can't tell if things I like are mine, or my cover's. I'm like Charlie Baltimore in 'The Long Kiss Goodnight,' or am I Samantha Caine? Take music for one: Do I really like Metallica, or was that just my psyche trying to compensate my seemingly feminine 'condition' with more masculine characteristics? Well I am 1 year+ out of that closet, and this sort of self discovery is going to continue for a little while.   Maybe that's why I'm starting this... but I highly doubt it 'cause I predict that the majority of the posts will be of a random nature as an outlet for the funny that courses through my veins.

1950,Leo,"             Last night I attended my 5 year high school reunion.  It was a tolerably pleasant evening.  I didn't really have any burning desire to see the people that I remembered from high school - for the most part I have kept in touch with the people I considered good friends.  I did have one pleasant surprise of a friend there.  I hadn't spoken with her since graduation.  I think we may have emailed for a bit a year or so after graduation, but we lost touch.  It was great catching up with her.  After a few hours though, I had about as much as I could take and took off.  5 years really didn't change anyone that much - old attitudes die hard.  This last week the esteemed mayor of Saint Paul, Mr. Randy Kelly, endorsed George W. Bush for re-election.  Now, this news wouldn't be so shocking, except that Kelly is a long-time DFL (Democrat to those non Minnesotans) party member.  He is from the East Side of Saint Paul, where a Republican hasn't been elected from that district in god knows how many years.  This endorsement comes as a bit of a shock.  Maybe its something in the water, as our last mayor also switched from DFL to Republican.  Although Kelly has stated that he has no intentions of switching parties, there are rumors that the governor may give him an appointment to a state post, or that he might run for US Senate.  The reason that Kelly gave behind his decision to back Bush is that he saw a bumper sticker that said 'I Hate Bush'.  He decided the liberals were pushing the politics of hate and his mind was made up from there.  I am thinking that if the mayor of Saint Paul bases his decisions upon bumper sticker politics, the DFL party might be better off without him.  Also in the political arena, this new terror threat bothers me.  Not that I am afraid of a terror threat, but that it seems to be politically motivated.  Normally candidates can expect a boost in the polls following their nominating conventions, but with the announcement of a new 'terror' threat, the Dept. of Homeland Security all but nullified the effects of the convention.  The Kerry camp has denied that it thinks the announcement was politically motivated, but honestly, can we really trust what we are being told?   From the 8/8/04 edition of the Saint Paul Pioneer Press 'Now, on the subject of the convention, most observers agreed last week brought a newly energized Democratic party, one focused on a common goal. With the party now in the spotlight, many people are wondering... ' (Stewart is handed a piece of paper) 'Oh. Terror warning. Guess I'll have to stop talking about the Democrats.' — Jon Stewart  On a lighter note, a  urlLink recent news item  states that the Dutch are now working to ban toe-licking.  Obviously seeking to protect the Danes pursuit of life, liberty and happiness, a simple solution is to ban toe-licking.  As I know you can all agree with me, when my toes get licked, I really do have a hard time feeling safe.  While the article states that the 'would be Casanova' could not be charged with any crime for licking unsuspecting ladies toes, I have to wonder, just how many different body parts can a stranger lick before commiting a crime.

1951,Virgo,       You know how they say the eyes are a window into a persons soul....Well if so so then my sould is a dark void that is only filled with pain and misary. I'm really depressed right now...For real...

1953,Aquarius,"       And by that I mean Knitters Anonymous because I am addicted.  I decided to pick up knitting again this weekend and have so far knitted 2 scarves and begun three more.  I'm obsessed.  I even raced after school to a knitting store that closes at four so that I could buy way too much yarn for half price.  But, at least my friends will nice have nice yarn in their scarves instead of the Walmart brands.  I want to constantly be knitting.  I've even started knitting in bed with no lights on.  That's right, knitting in the dark, sexy.  And yesterday, I had to refrain from taking the knitting to the bathroom with me.  Knitting is on the brain so much that it's all I think about (at least for the last few days).  Like, when I'm at work or out with friends I keep thining 'I really wish I had my knitting right now.  I really want to finish that scarf.'  It's like I need a bumper sticker that says I'D RATHER BE KNITTING.  And no, there is no purling, just kniting and knitting and knitting.  See the obsession, it's bad and well, I need to get back to the needles and the yarn.   Tonight was yet another wedding related event, a surprise semi-shower for the friend and co-teacher.  Enough with the wedding stuff already.  The showers and the bachelorette parties and the girl's weekends and the weddings.  I mean there is no money left, the well is dry.  I'm really going to be weddinged out by November.  'Dear Lord, make me a bird so I can fly far far away.  Dear Lord, make me a bird so I can fly far far away.'  Or maybe, I'll just bring my knitting and then it will all be bareable.         "

1958,Capricorn,"           Helluv everyone!  I'm kind of new to this blog-thing, but you bet I'm plugged in. Cool to read all your fascinating everyday-stories. Special thanks goes to Tim and Ulli who both made me laugh very loud in this damned quiet norwegian PC-lab. In a PC-lab in Norway one is not supposed to talk or laugh, so everyone turned around and looked at me like if I was some kind of retard...   Yep yep, I hope everybody is still doing fine out there. As Ulli just announced, I'm going to China this sunday. It was kind of a funny story, because two weeks ago I got a phone call from a friend who is working there asking me whether I wanted to join him as an english teacher at Nanchang University in China. I thought aboout it for one day, because it would radically mess up all my career  plans, but the day after I called him and said: 'Hell yeah, I'm going!' I considered it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that I would regret my whole life if I didn't accept.   So now I try to get all the official papers in order before I leave to China next sunday. We're gonna go on holidays to a small island in the South-China Sea for 14 days before we head back to Nanchang and start teaching. I'm gonna be in charge of the oral english-classes, which means I have to try to get shy chineese girls and guys into talking english. It's gonna be quite a challenge but I hope that with great entusiasm and humour I can make it work. (do chineese have humour??)   I'll let you know how things are going when I come down to the land of the yellow people. Until then, keep writing folks! Love to hear from ya all...

1959,Leo,"           I'm a damned tech junkie. I really love new fangled tech toys that I will never have a use for and will never be able to afford. Example: I think those 50 inch plasma tv's are the coolest thing since - well, since the tv. I don't really watch that much tv, and I can't exactly buy one, since they run about 25 grand and I don't currently have a job. But I want one soooooo bad. I also think it would be neat to have one of those 4 thousand dollar laptops to play the sims on at the local truckstop. yeah, I want an 800mhz laptop computer, with 128 megs or more of ram, 20 or so gigs of hard drive space, and I would spend my time playing mp3's wth it and playing games. Now, any gadget can be cool and 'must have', but to truly rock, it's gotta have a useless remote. Like those car stereos with a little tiny remote control, even though you are never going to be more then 2 feet from the damn thing. I want remote controls for everything I own. I want a toaster with no external controls. Yeah.... My toaster could have a usb cable on it, and I could bring up the toaster control panel (toaster.cpl) to make toast. Or if I prefer, I could use the 2.4ghz remote, and make toast from a mile away. This would all be pointless, since I'd still have to go load bread into the toaster, but I would still show it off to all my friends. Actually, I want one of those whole house control things, except with the functionality of the fantasy toaster i just mentioned. I want to be sitting in front of the computer, pick up a bigass remote with an lcd touch screen or fire up a program, and make toast, record a rerun of 'newsradio', let the dog outside, fire up the stereo to play some fear factory, fire a warning shot at the zealot passing out flyers at my front door, warm up my car, pet the cat, get the newspaper, call a friend and make plans to go somewhere, celebrate the chinese new year, donate 1 dollar to the 'shut sally struthers the hell up' foundation, scratch my balls, clean the toilet, and scratch my balls again for good measure - all from the comfort of my heated, massaging, sound system having, fridge having chair.

1960,Pisces,"       She still won't reply to me, which pisses me off. But I guess if she continues to ignore me, I can just kiss her ass goodbye, which might be a relief. Plus, Zach is on vacation, so he hasn't e-mailed me lately. I miss him immensely.  It's hard to find good people online that you can talk to. I certainly haven't in years, if you don't count Dane, who isn't fun to talk to anyways, and I just put up with him because we go to the same school.  So I want to make some 'new friends' to chat with, because I'm pretty lonely when I'm online now.

1963,Capricorn,"                 The phrase 'be yourself' is a very popular one. But I find it ironic that those who want to be themselves often resort to things that make them even more like others. That may be confusing, but here's what I mean: Those who want to stand out, or be different often resort to many piercings, tattoos, dyeing and styling their hair in odd ways, and other unnatural things like that. However, my point is that those things only make them stand out  less . For I can walk through the mall and see three people with green hair, or multiple piercings and it only detracts from what is  really original : their natural selves. When you dye your hair green it takes away your own unique color, and it puts you in a class of all the others who have green hair. When you cover yourself with tattoos it detracts attention from your God-given natural looks to something made by man. So in the end those who claim that they are 'being themselves' are really only hiding what is theirs alone. Am I making any sense?      "

1970,Cancer,"       What with the broken car, strep throat, pink eye and numerous other lovely things going on around here, I haven't had time or the inclination for doing much reading.  It's times like this that unless the book is superb, it won't hold my attention and give me the satisfaction I want.  After all, isn't that what reading is all about?   My reading list here is going a few weeks back and is very scant.     urlLink Scarecrow - Robin Hathaway  Despite the wholly unoriginal title, this book is great.   urlLink Full Blast - Janet Evanovich and Charlotte Hughes  This one went back to the library unfinished (among others I am just tired of listing the failures but this one was too bad to pass up).  I love Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series, but I haven't liked this collaboration much from the start.  This one was just too cheesy and out there for me to go along with.  I hope her Plum series doesn't start going downhill.   urlLink Sunset Over Chocolate Mountains - Susan Elderkin  Very interesting and different novel.   urlLink Sunshine and Shadow; Broken Dishes - Earlene Fowler  These two made it all worthwhile.  Earlene Fowler and the Benni Harper series are my absolute favorites.  If you are a lover of mystery, quilts, history and art you should definitely check this series out.  I won't go into details on these today as I am a bit feverish and might not be coherent.           "
1971,Aquarius,"                 Sometimes when you look for something so hard you don't see that what you need might be right in front of you. We all live with perceptions...about ourselves, others, the world..spend a lot of time classifying the same. In the pursuit of all things wonderful we forget the wonder in what we already have. Nothing is sweeter than realizing that old adage...it's not having what you want...it's wanting what you have.  I'm taking time for me for a change, and it is not an easy thing. I am so used to being many things to many people. But what I keep getting told is that if I don't take care of me first my efforts are pretty much wasted. Funny after 33 years to be told my expectations of myself are too high...when I have thought I just wasn't trying hard enough. Ah if only...if only what I don't know...but...ahhh if only.  I love finding the beauty and art in everything...the way the sun shines through the leaves on my apple tree just so. The brilliant diamond sparkles as it dances across the water in the pool. The flowing motion of the ripples across the pool as a giggling child spins around as fast as she can in the water. And her laughter...I still think it's one of the best things I have ever and will ever hear. Right up there with hearing her sweet voice first thing in the morning reminding me I am loved. It's been far too long since the depth of my love for her has moved me to tears...and here I sit reminding myself that she is the reason I need to be whole and happy.   Take that extra minute to find the beauty in your day, that one small reason no matter what it might be...remind yourself it doesn't all have to be stress and hurry. Cause this ride around the sun will be as brief as the ones before and the cosmos needs your spark of light to be full of everything that made you smile.  Cheers      "
1972,Cancer,"       'ello. Recently returned from Jackson MS where I was enjoying a leisurely, sleepy weekend. Father's Day was fairly uneventful. I remember nothing of the trip back to Memphis for I was asleep for the entire thing, or hovering in that nether region between total unconsciousness and semi-awakeness.  The second purpose of this litle trip to Jackson was my birthday celebration with my grandparents. Mi abuelita made me a vanilla bean cake spread with reaspberry/white chocolate icing.

1975,Libra,"       I got a first round interview with Mars Inc..   Me..   when I got the email I didn't believe it so I printed it out..   When I got to the interview (after a week or two of apprehension) the lady, Narelle, told us that 3900 ppl had applied, and only 510 invited to attend..   So now I am waiting to hear about the second round.. and its killing me softly!!!!!!!!!   ALso, today I met this guy from my class, Jian Du. I have wanted to meet him for awhile but the opp never came up. I wondered about him for awhile now.. Eddy and I were at the Unibar and i saw him and his friend sitting there and waved, then went inside. After about 2 hours, they came over to us to talk and had a drink with us.  I thought he was from Shanghai but he is from Harbin, even further north, near Russia. Thats so cool, I have never met someone from there. He sais it is very cold.. His name is Jian Du. There was also another person I met today, a guy also , and he is from Penang!! His name is Sze Yen. Small world!!   Tonight has been busy even though I haven't done much, i caught up with Bee, Emma and Seri over the phone.   Got Gmail, and it had my name! Its pretty cool.

1977,Aries,"                 Have you ever had the feeling you were alone? Even though the whole world is surrounding you, they aren’t really with you at all. I was sitting next to my best friend and her boyfriend who at that time was my crush. I look down at their hands, holding each other’s hands. I look down at my hands holding nobody’s but my own. As I was walking to my next class, with my arms crossed, I saw them again. This time they were hugging. Again I look at myself to see that I was in fact hugging nobody but myself. I really shouldn’t feel so alone, but for some unknown reason I do. It is painful, being alone and all. But I know there’s someone out there for me too. Actually, I KNEW there was someone out there for me, until I met my love. I finally found him. There is nobody that could compare to him. Until fate breaks us apart, which we both know will happen soon, I’m NOT alone. For once, I’m not alone.                "

When we were waiting in the line to board the ferry to come back home my grandma and my sister had to go to the washroom and so they left the line leaving the rest of us there...well you can guess what happened, the ferry came and they hadnt come back yet so me, my grandpa and a friend left on the ferry, leaving my uncle there waiting. So after waiting for another 45min for the next ferry to arrive we left to go back home.

1982,Gemini,"        Broken Dreams   It's amazing how you don't realize how much something meant to you until you suddenly don't have it. Even if you set yourself up to not have, know that you don't have a great chance at it - there's still that glimmer, that ray of hope deep down...that maybe...just maybe...you ARE good enough.  Then that tiny glimmer is fanned into a fantastic shining light...but what it reveals is a harsh, cold reality that you really are not good enough.  What's more shocking, is that for a Queen, I like to think my emotions are able to hide themselves quite well. Ordinarily, they are, but for that damned 'hope', that false sense of a Hope that will not be. Disappointment is another...hurt intermingled deep within it, rising up in a rapidly advancing wave, consuming me until I fairly ache from it.   Why do I have dreams again?  Verily, i do believe I'd rather pain to this Hurt.          "

Anyways, I got a Pocket PC this week.  It rocks!!  It's the Toshiba e740.  It has WiFi and voice recording which will both be very handy.

1984,Aries,"           Ok.  I'll bite.  For the sake of this argument, let's say that Trent Lott DIRECTLY said he was in favor of segregation and all the other race garbage from the South of 50 years ago.  Bottom line, he is entitled to his opinion, politically correct or not.  The last I checked, the First Amendment was still in force.  Why does he have to resign his post?  If the Republicans want him as their leader, that is their choice.  Keep in mind that, according to a black radio show host I saw on TV the other day (Tom Joyner?), 98% of the black vote in this country goes to the Democrats.  Odds are, the voters who would vote based on only the issue of Civil Rights, already voted for the Democrats because of the perception (wrong in my opinion) that the Democrats are more dedicated to that issue.  So, what damage is there to be done by taking the black vote away?  Politically, none.         "

1986,Taurus,"           So, I was all excited about being able to take pictures off my computer and send them to my phone.  Got two pictures done, then the service mysteriously stopped working.  Shit.  Have sent 2-3 emails to the guy who created the uploader, have yet to get a response.  So, I called sprint, and reported this 'data error 907' - sat on hold for 20 minutes, then got some guy who sort of knew what he was talking about.  I explained to him what I was doing, only to have him tell me that Sprint has 'blocked' that site, b/c of potential copyright infringement.   What the fuck?!?   Apparently if I take a picture of a copyrighted picture with my phone and start passing it around with my phone, Sprint is somehow liable for that.  Sounds like some sort of Kazaa type shit, which is also garbage.   But, thats not what I'm doing.   I'm taking pictures with  MY DAMN CAMERA  and want to upload them to  MY DAMN PHONE  .  What the flying fuck is the problem with this?!?!  As much as I can't argue with the guy (he's an IT peon answering phones) I  DO  think it's complete bullshit that if I take pictures on my own personal camera and want to put them on my cell phone, that sprint is telling me that I can't - b/c that is  EXACTLY  what's going on here.

1988,Libra,"             The Cure show was awesome.  We didn't get in for free as I had hoped but it was almost worth the $36.  I talked to Andrew before we left and he informed me that Muse was going on at 7.  This was unfortunately at 5:30 which give me almost enough time to make the drive if I don't stop at all.  It turns out that I hit some construction on the way up and, well, had to push my little Escort to it's limits.  I had told Brandon to go ahead without me but I figured he hadn't left yet so I met him at his house.  Well, we were both starving at that point so we stopped at Wendy's and the gas station.  So we get off at the exit and stop to see how much the scalpers want for tickets.  They offer us 5th row for $50 each.  I had looked online and it said tickets were $17 to $51 so we passed thinking lawn seats were $17.  Wrong.  We end up paying the $36 at the door which is a bit more than I'm acustomed to but we could see and hear Muse playing and we couldn't turn back.  We got to see about half of their set.  They had a great light show which would have been much cooler if it had been dark.  Then we watched Interpol for their first song.  Then we went back to the second stage to get a good spot for Thursday.  I must admit I haven't listened to Thursday for about a year and a half but I was pretty impressed by their newer stuff.  The Cure was next and I can't say I'm super into the Cure.  They played their new single third which I thought was kinda odd.  Another oddity was that they played all their older hits right in the middle of their set, at least all that I could think of.  Anyway, Brandon and I left early and spotted a very strange looking tree.  It looked like it had people in the trunk.  I took some pictures which will be up shortly.  Then we rented movies and watched Waiting for Guffman until I headed home.           "

1990,Gemini,"       While being interviewed on his campaign jet, General Wesley Clark, The Decisive One, became confused when questioned about his position on authorizing the use of force against Iraq.  So, he yelled for Mary, his secretary to give him a hand with the tough questions.  This is a real gem:   'Mary, help!' he called to his press secretary, Mary Jacoby, at the front of the plane, as he faced questions about Iraq. 'Come back and listen to this.' At one point, Ms. Jacoby interrupted the interview, which included four reporters who were traveling on the general's jet, to make certain that General Clark's views on the original Iraq resolution were clear. 'I want to clarify — we're moving quickly here,' Ms. Jacoby said. 'You said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a U.N.-based solution.' 'Right,' General Clark responded. 'Exactly.'    urlLink The full article can be found in the  New York Times .          "

I can't stand any of this anymore. Why do I have to sacrifice so much, for someone, to make them a better person, when it's most likly hurting me a hundred times more. I don't get it.

2001,Leo,"             i may get in trouble for this post, oh well... so here's the dilly, i finally got  Super Link  13 (after 2 weeks) back from the typesetter to find she had gone through and changed several puncuation and capitalization and various other things despite my explicitly telling her not to worry about editing anyway (she's supposed to check the typeset (since i apply most of the styles now before it even gets to her) and check translation on a few lines for me), what's worse is after all her editing, she still missed several bad spellings and such (one that I even missed until after my first encode)... and i still haven't recieved 14 from her... as for 15+ from the Translator, well... i get to blame the typesetter again! He apparently had thought since 13 and 14 still weren't out yet after 2 weeks then we must've taken a small summer break, and i guess he didn't want to create a backlog of scripts for me... on to  Masterforce , the aforemetioned typesetter threw a fit because I didn't use her on the project (this while i was still waiting on 13 and 14 from her), also all of WPP were upset that i wasn't trying to release a 175MB version. So i had to re-encode at 175 to show them how that looks (and that was a chore too, more on that later)... anyway, there is quality loss, too much to justify 58MB smaller, so nyah... NOW, amidst all this, my PC kept hard locking while i was encoding... turns out my 120GB HDD is failing on me, so i've got an Advance RMA coming from Maxtor and hopefully should receive that Monday or Tuesday... My connection at work has been complete ass lately, a little over a week ago they moved all systems over onto a back up power system... since then anytime i send a file on IRC, it'll go for awhile, and then drop. not just drop, my IRC connection will reset, all webpages fail to load, etc. I'm on the same segment as our monitoring station, and it times out on all pings when this happens... apparently one switch had already gone bad, but they havent nailed down where this problem is, but apparently its not just me having problems with it... i have atleast one more night of it though because the sysadmin wont get to looking at it again till Monday day (i work Monday morning 00:00-08:00) so that's all my computer related problems... want to hear the personal ones?

2002,Pisces,"             While the asses cobraed yesterday, it was back to the Birdcage (the new name for the studio) to work on the Audio Warfare remix. As I'm sure you can figure out, the track is pretty hard, and quite honestly, the remix is even harder. I think my friend Christian Nitrate will approve.   Needleye delivered big time on their remix of the aggression's MY WHITE NOVA. It's a stormer and does what I like best with remixes, uses a lot of the original song for the listener to know its a remix, yet adds so much of themselves to it that it becomes interesting and original. They manipulated a vocal that original said 'you were so goddamn pretty' to sound like 'you were so goddamn prissy'. Hilarious. Kudos and thanks to Gilez and Needleguys. The remix reminded me of why I originally wanted to be in a heavy band.   However, now with half the EP now, I find myself in that position that I HATE more than anything, which is nagging the other remixers to hand theirs in by the deadline. This is even harder when you have people remixing in places like Japan and Russia. When I was watching over 12 or so remixers for PURE LIQUID EGO, I felt like the bigggest asshole in the world trying to get people to finish, especially since they were working for free. Hate it. I do like nagging Jamie Duffy though...he deserves it. ;-)  It's interesting that while I am chin deep in the Hypefactor album, I find myself going back to listening to very hard music. I'm loading the Ipod with old v23, Schwein and of course, old Chemlab. I think this is a yin and thing. Ash was recently disenchanted with one of his many musical projects and I explained to him that we all have different moods and the music we do reflects that. That's why now, in our Power Station/Arcadia phase, I feel a longing for the aggression and that kind of music. Eventually. Right now, I have Chemlab to keep me in that vibe.  The evening ended at the pub celebrating S.O.'s birthday with half of poontang and half the pac (in the form of G and the Kidd). The evening included cameo's from Bing and MURRAY! Good times, though we send good thoughts out to our dear friend Dorg, who had a bit of a spill earlier in the day and is in rough shape. Much love to her.  And now...brunch.  F           "

The roads there are not near large or elaborate enough to accommodate all of the traffic.  I spent the last 4 days with veins popping out of my forehead, and terrible things coming out of my mouth.  NOBODY there drives with ANY urgency.  Cant tell you how many times I've pleaded with people to GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!!!!!!  It will be a while before I can endure such incompetence behind the wheel!   drunk...  When in Rome, do what the Romans do.  I was drunk from about 1 hour after landing until Monday morning....around 11:00 AM.  I suspect that this hang over will persist until i leave friday for a bachelor party in Chicago.  Anyone have a liver they can loan me?  Mine's almost out!!!   junk in the trunk...  My lil bro Kevin is the man.  This kid should be on the fucken bomb squad...that's all i can say about this line item.  He is the master of disarming disaster!   a bank robber...  In an effort to expand my ever growing army of tattoos, I had planned to get one while in Colorado from a place where my little brothers go to get theirs.  We scope the place out, and I'm all stoked to go on Saturday morning to get inked...until i read the paper!  The asshole who gives the great tattoos decided to rob the bank (the one in the parking lot next to the parlor) and gets caught because intelligence is not what hez good at.  This foolz girl friend works at the bank, and he robbed it by going to the drive up and asking for all the money.  Little did he know that they could see him, and since they all see each other every fucken day, he was recognized and caught.  The tattoo parlor seems to be closed, and needless to say, i didn't get my ink.  Lame.  So there it is kids...yet another epic adventure.  There are, of course, details that i could never give you because i'm under N.D.A. but believe me when I say this...it was one unforgettable trip.  All of this happened around the main event which was a wedding of 2 good friends of mine.....they went through with it.    "

2007,Scorpio,"           I am still working on the painting currently entitled Old Lady and child.  I am putting some lines on the fence, and it is kind of a bitch.  I tape areas, paint, then let it dry for 2 days before i can do it again.   Its slow going.  I found out today at work I have to go back to Germany twice in september.  I have tickets for a pixies concert in mid september, (seeing the pixies play is on my life to do list), of course,  manager man wants me to skip it.      HAHAHAHAA i say.  Not a chance, sucker.   So now I will be flying back to texas to see the show, then getting back on a plane (20 hour travel day) to go back to work.  You know what? It's worth it.

2008,Capricorn,"       Most of us would have the unfortunate but rather necessary experience of a ferocious cur wanting, waiting and anticipating a move from you as an excuse to pounce. These impertinent mutts with unwarranted fury always seem to be on their heels, flushing their anger at the wrong direction. Which ever way you see it, they suffer nothing in turn of their despicable character, unless you count all those irritance emancipating out of the pores of their previous victims.  Well, to those who haven't meet a dog with ultra-sensitive smell reseptors on their smooth, black nostrils, you might be suprised that you can actually find them anywhere. Not only do they guard houses owned by sufferers of OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder, in terms of security in this case), but, thanks to this era of globalization, they can be found even in office premises....  That brings me to the discussion of the day...  Has anyone been to the Centre of Pre-University Studies staff office without getting clearance from the dedicated 'watchman' (in this case, our security guard in question has to be promoted)? Then again, the bigger question is why do students need clearance to meet mentors, their only guide in the seemingly never ending bower of dreary theoretical facts. However unrelevent all these facts are in the real world, students need all these facts to get pass this hurdle. This hurdle of course starts with a mere height of a millimeter to the height where only the   escape speed   can take you....(  the minimum speed required by a space craft to escape the earths' gravitational   field  )  Back to my point, since this 'watchman' is after all human, it is not exempted from partiality. Well...let me put it this way, if you throw a big, fat, juicy bone to a dog, it would most certainly lick you, but if you were to step on its tail, you'll be visiting your local doctor for your rabies vaccine injections........  Thus, students tend to give various accounts of the accountability of the security system in this little secluded office.   'Who? Oh 'watchman'? Well I'm mostly lucky. It's always busy when I walk in. Like the other day it was having a bone wedged between its paws and its ears, muttering non-stop in a highly serious manner. So I simply mouthed the name of my lecturer to it and with the wagging of its tail, allowed me enterence to it's lair...'  'Gosh, don't remind me. Why is it so difficult to let us in? We can't be giving away bones all the time. All I needed to do was to put the book on my lecturers' table. But it went on barking, denying me entrance....'  'Apply Newton's Third Law lah my friend. To every action there is a reaction. I just walk in equiped with a bag of fresh chicken bones for its inspection. I mean, you need to apply the psychology of the 'opposite-sex' to get your way sometimes.......in your case, it can't be applied...'  'It let you in without having a bite of your flesh? That's not fair at all! **ry, **ry, what a contrary!'  'Of course it won't let you in, you didn't pay your fees for the next semester right. Your friend did, that's why it was sniffing her instead of you...'    Examples shown, it would be pointless to go on. Remember, if you venture to the staff room in the fourth floor, you have been forwarned!            "

2012,Virgo,"   One tear falls; I wipe away before they see Before they get the chance to see the weakness inside of me Because of my pride it is so difficult to reveal It's so hard to show anyone, how I really feel  The heart in my chest may be breaking in two But you won't ever see me shed a tear or cry in front of you  So I'll bury my feelings deep down inside again They could resurface but I don't know where or when  I am scared of nothing but I always feel afraid And from their critical eyes, I am trying to evade Keeping what lies within me right where it belongs Speaking to no one of my sad and lovely songs  I wanted to feel nothing and this wish is coming true That's what happens when I try to hide myself away from you I guess should feel sadder, now that I am turning numb But when offered a life unfeeling, it's so easy to succumb  The pain is gone away now but the joy has left me too I move about like a shadow with my vision all askew This isn't what I wanted if I could I would feel fear But I can't so what I'll shed for you is one small, simple tear.

2014,Cancer,"       Whee....the National Fervour is gone.  Look. Four days gone in a simple breeze. It really tells that time really flies, or perhaps fly faster than the speed of light I guess. But we couldn't prove that according to scientific method I guess, perhaps in the artistic mind I suppose? It can also tell us that life is really short...with perhaps a quick test of life on earth?  I was wonderin' the other day on why do other people write such minuscule blog entries? It seems rather stupid to me that most would write such blogs of puny and pathetic content. If you have nothing to write, then don't write at all! That is one of my main motto in my constitution, which definitely restricts personal freedom and permits the powerful result as a strict regulated student.  But looks like I've left out the 1A07 Gossip Club. I suppose the strict regulations of the constitution should have nothing to do with it lest it would cause me to lose one of my most favourite pastimes. Besides, the world can never go round without gossip. In a nutshell, humans need gossip to alleviate any boredom that awaits them. Even people back in the stone age were gossiping on which caveman to marry as well. And speaking of cavemen, there are quite a number of them at Yishun where they buy a big chicken drumstic and start using their teeth to gnaw at it. It is so uncivilised to have such actions done for it destroys the mere meaning of civilisation. We are humans, not animals!  Okok...looks like my bitchiness level was getting too high. Whenever you feel bitchy, you'll always feel like bitching around, and when you bitch around, you tend to get lame and corny as well that you will not produce corn but instead develop corns on your feet. Hmmm...shouldn't be too 'xiaxue' already!  Hikaru Utada's songs are so nice to hear, especially Can You Keep A Secret & Traveling. (Yes, it's spelt this way. Even her English is not perfect and no Japanese has bothered to correct her 'cause their English is worser than her American-born one and that anything English is very high-class in Japan whereas we Singaporeans think that it kinda' sux 'cause we've been learning since we were small toddlers!) But, I'd prefer to hear her songs 'cause they are so nice and she writes her own songs as well! =)  Thinking about Singlish, I wonder how do foreigners learn it? It must be difficult to learn it if you're not a native of Singapore or if you have not stayed in Singapore before. Like for example, when do you know how to use  lah  or when do you know how to use  lor ? It is really difficult for the foreigner to communicate in Singlish. Who knows? It could be a National Language of Singapore someday when the Singaporean society has integrated so much that we discard our four original languages.  Okok....I guess too much is too much. I have to retire to the night now.  A very wonderful night!          "

Or, sitting on the tank with your legs over the front, and your GF driving the bike from your seat - basically not.smart.stuff.

2021,Libra,"                  Hello.   Been a good day. Weather has been a bit odd yet again today, Global warming is definatly out of control and nothing can be done about it. (oh dear, I'm going on a ramble. No, not a walking holiday with wellies and a stick but a ramble about the weather. Actually, I'm not so sure which is better?!)   I still have nothing too great to tell. I am going to 'the festival' tomorrow which should be fun, if it doesn't rain. But who really&nbsp;cares if it rains? Festival weather-it's predictable.   My mum has started being secret policewomen of our road. She is keeping very close watch on everyone who happens to go past (especially across the road). I would not be suprised if I happened across a police uniform in the washing machine! She believes that there is a bit of drug dealing going on in the caravan across the road (to be honest there is a pretty good chance that she is right!). However, this is the house of Ondrej, (tennis champion and fishing extrodinaire!-not) and I'm sure if he found out about this there would be many bananas thrown and windows broken!   Anyway,&nbsp;I shouldn't be talking about other peoples buisiness!   La-di-la! My brother road his bike to Nailsea today (crazy boy). God knows why. I'll give you the lowdown.

2022,Aries,"           I would counter that there is now a precedent for federal court intervention in federal elections and that there is a constitutional basis for it. the supreme court did not choose bush over gore as much as it made florida clearly define what their election process is and whether the process itself violated federal law. from bush vs. gore  urlLink http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=531&invol=98   The petition presents the following questions: whether the Florida Supreme Court established new standards for resolving Presidential election contests, thereby violating Art. II, 1, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution and failing to comply with 3 U. S. C. 5, and whether the use of standardless manual recounts violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. With respect to the equal protection question, we find a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  The Florida Supreme Court has ordered that the intent of the voter be discerned from such ballots. For purposes of resolving the equal protection challenge, it is not necessary to decide whether the Florida Supreme Court had the authority under the legislative scheme for resolving election disputes to define what a legal vote is and to mandate a manual recount implementing that definition. The recount mechanisms implemented in response to the decisions of the Florida Supreme Court do not satisfy the minimum requirement for non-arbitrary treatment of voters necessary to secure the fundamental right. Florida's basic command forthe count of legally cast votes is to consider the 'intent of the voter.' Gore v. Harris, ___ So. 2d, at ___ (slip op., at 39). This is unobjectionable as an abstract proposition and a starting principle. The problem inheres in the absence of specific standards to ensure its equal application. The formulation of uniform rules to determine intent based on these recurring circumstances is practicable and, we conclude, necessary.  While I understand Ted Rall's frustration with having Bush as president, I do not agree that the election was a judicial coup d'etat.  What it was though is an example, notedin the supreme court ruling itself, that the vote counting systems in this country are antiquated and need to be changed and standardized so everyone's vote can be counted. Florida was having different counties determine what was and was not a 'hanging chad'.  how can this be considered equal protection for all state voters wheneach district has it's own standards about what constitutes a vote?  and jimi, this case in front of the supreme court was brought by bush not by gore.

2026,Aquarius,"             One thing I love about Seoul (and I mean this about Korea in general...I just happen to be a little Seoul-centric) is the street sellers.  I don't really trust the food they sell on the side of the road (except ice cream) but virtually everything else is fair game for me.  For example, to get ready for my trip to Canada and generally stock up, in the last two weeks I bought:  2 plants in a can for my nieces (8,000 won) 2 lightweight sports shirts for inlining (10,000 won for both) 1 pair of shorts for inlining (20,000 won) 3 bags of dried 고구마 (goguma, sweet potatoes or yams, they were selling 1 for 3,000 won , 2 for 5,000 but I got 3 for 6,000) 1 tie (at an amazing price of 5,000 won, or USD 4...and I can't really tell how it's worse than the ones I bought for USD 100 back home.) 10 disposible razors (for 1,000 won, or USD 0.80 FOR ALL TEN) 1 noise-making toy hammer for boy #2 (1,000 won) 3 Disney photo albums (but I'm sure ol' Walt didn't make a penny on these....just 1,000 won each)  The clothes-seller guy spoke pretty good English...I know because he held my hostage for 5 minutes as we talked about how Korean men are getting fatter (hence his stock of larger sizes for husky guys like me) and how he learned English working for the US Army about 20-30 years ago.  The goguma-guy didn't know a lot of English, but he did speak Spanish owing to the fact that he lived in Argentina for a few years.  Unfortunately, Spanish is not one of my languages...I know a fair bit of French from my school-days, a smattering Japanese and, of course, some Korean. Anyways, when I passed the goguma-guy later in the week I gave him a big 'hola!' (Spanish for hello, and the extent of my proficiency) and he returned one as well...wow, bridging the cultures with another one...how UN of me.  Below is a picture of the famous Yeouido tie-truck.

2029,Pisces,"       So I have come to the conclusion that today's songwriters have no real creativity.  I was listening to the radio today, and the band Staind came on.  Here we have a group of guys who will tell you that they are happy and well adjusted (Ive seen it in interviews) singing about not belonging and being all depressed and shit.  This new trend in suicide rock is all a giant load of bull.  If you insist on looking to songs to understand how most young Americans feel about themselves look to Weezer's 'In the Garage' and 'Undone- the Sweater Song.'  They are all about kids finding a safe place to be themselves.      One more note.  If these new artists want to learn something about depression writing check out the Blind Melon album with the bee girl.  It's all about subversively depressing people with a happy beat.

2034,Aries,"   Once the party discovers what happened to Castillion (a mystery that technically matters directly to only two present characters -- Gregory and Ian), the group will be at an interesting crux:  What Next?  The party is now international in membership, and global (and beyond) in awareness of The World.  The mysteries and challenges that have been placed on the table are definitely different from how the story began.  This may be frustrating to some, and I understand the desire for simplicity (Let's Just Get The Ring to Mount Doom), but it was always my intention to create a broad, organic world within which various characters could pursue adventure and glory.  I had done the Single Through-Line campaign before; I was interested in trying something with fewer (if any) boundaries.  The catch, though, is that the game began with certain set archetypes, if you will -- various Local Yokels and a couple of Wild Cards who set out to figure something out -- and those archetypes may, very reasonably, strain a bit at the edges as they move beyond the comfort zone of what they originally intended and expected to do.  Which is kind of my point -- what do the players feel about their characters' comfort zones?  Of the current party, Fennie and Connor are the most likely to pursue adventure for its own sake.  Rhanellus has a personal journey to take that seems, at the moment, to be connected to the Big Picture in some unknown way.  Adan has a spiritual calling to Right What Has Been Changed, and it is natural for him to roam the world on that quest.  Luc, like Rhanellus, has a personal journey that seems linked somehow to the events of the world -- specifically, the often-mentioned return of the Demon Kings.  But then, there are other issues:  Connor would probably like to find the other two thirds of the Codex one day; Fennie would like to put this map to the Dragon's Graveyard to use before she dies; Luc would like to know who made her a 'key,' and can it be undone; and Rhanellus wants to go wherever clues lead him to his own self-knowledge.  Each of these goals is, unlike the World In Crisis situation, not only individual and unique, but geographically diverse -- to the point:  Candlekeep, the Citadel of the Raven, the mountains on the other side of the Dalelands, Cormyr, Zhentil Keep, and the distant land of Thay.  Talk about an Indiana Jones red line map crawl.  And then:  What of Gregory?  Does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone, or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the Central Heartlands of Faerun, patrolling the darkness that lurks therein?  Likewise, what of Ian?  Should he return to the monastery and report what he has learned, or is he a free agent?  I'm not declaring anything here -- just sharing some observations from this side of the screen.  What we have now is the result of something I have personally always wanted to do, but never tried -- a game world that spans centuries, nations, and even continents and oceans.  There is room for everyone, and for every player in the saga, Glory Awaits.  But what Glory will that be?  The Local Hero?  The Regional Hero?  The Hero of the Land?  The Hero of a World?  Or the Hero of the Multiverse?  Certainly questions worth thinking about.  As I mentioned in the previous post, all characters are welcome to follow their path to Glory from the point where they started.  Likewise, players are free to create new heroes should their characters evolve onto a path unique to themselves.  Unless a character dies, everyone who has been in the world will still be an active and prominent participant in the world, even if they are not represented in a game session.  Boris Borovich and Burne Trinson are out there even now, making choices that matter.  The same could be said of any character that chose to veer off on his or her own.  Personally, I like all the characters.  I enjoy their choices and their actions, both their desires and the things they don't really give a flying fig about.  All are welcome to do as they please, as they follow their own Road to Glory.  "
2035,Aries,           33% MORE!         
2036,Virgo,"       Roger Clemens has been labeled as a head hunter on more than one occasion and some would say he has made a career out of it. He is more than willing to throw high and tight to the best in the league to get the psychological edge. I understand that this is part of the game for some pitchers so I let this slide. After all he is a great pitcher. Then comes the Mike Piazza fiasco. Piazza breaks his bat on an inside pitch and Clemens chooses to pick the bat up and throw it at him. I thought this was in poor taste, but most of the media stands up for him and tells us that he is a 'fiery pitcher who was caught up in the heat of the game.' Somewhat disappointed I accept this excuse and move on. But it doesn't seem to stop there with more bean balls to the helmet. Now he has officially made it to my ugly celebrity list. On July 31st, while watching his son play in a little league tournament in Colorado, Roger Clemens was ejected to the parking lot by an umpire. Wait it gets worse. On July 31st, the Astros were in Cinncinati playing the Reds and needless to say Roger wasn't there. Now I'm not very impressed with that part of it because he's not doing a very good job of displaying team unity, but at least he was cutting class to go be with his family. Now on the subject of the ejection. WHAT THE F$#@? Not only is this a 10-year old little league game, but he has no business arguing with the umpires. You can be sure that every kid on that team looks up to him and I don't think arguing about calls makes a very good impression kids of any age. Apparently he wasn't thrown out for arguing, but instead for spitting a sunflower seed on the umpires pants. While this alone is no reason to be tossed, it certainly is not behavior becoming of a professional baseball player. You can make comments to defend him if you want, but I don't think it is going to change my mind.          "

2039,Cancer,"       Braindead, cranial damage, skull hemorrhoid, whatever. Pre-Calculus test was actually somewhat fun, but the AP Bio test (open book) was rather difficult, and the AP English Hemingway test was hell, despite who may argue it. Three tests, in total. But they are gone, and my economics report is finished, and I am free (except for the PSAT, which will destroy my mind utterly).  My grandparents have a new rat dog. They want me to come over and name him/her/it.  At Rhodes, I wrote this really creepy piece of poetry, becuase it has a lot to do with suicide, and I found myself rather afraid as I realized I wondered about how much a slit wrist would hurt. But here's the odd piece about it:   Metal splinter  My hands are dragging me into a kitchen In some unknown home I built Overnight, while I was sleeping And my mind was working furiously Eyes burning in REM chaos, again, again, Trying to wake up twice, once from the slumber Twice, from the half-reality I have Assumed to be mine, and my fingers are itching To reach for the wall near the toaster To grasp the wood of a straightedge Knife, sword, blade, keen bright metal And wondering what it feels like when blood When life drips out on the stone floor Impatiently waiting… For the wonderful, ethereal euphoria that comes When the waves smother the breath When the snow freezes the veins When the mind begins to drift Because the body has no real purpose anymore No, my wrist has no eye of blood yet I have a sliver Gone to get a bandage (it won’t stop the cut).   As I said, somewhat unnerving. But I spoke to Alanna about these weird thoughts, and she reassured me that I was not insane, I was simply teen-age. Rather comforting.  Full weekend of hell ahead. Cheers, mortals.    "

My thoughts on James Lileks you ask? Nobody does it better.  If his 'Bleat' is not a daily 'must read' for you, your life is that much poorer without your even knowing it.  Seriously.  An observation from today's Opinion Jounal: Stanley's colleague Adam Nagourney tries to find hope for the Democrats: 'Some Republicans said the images of a forceful Mr. Reagan giving dramatic speeches on television provided a less-than-welcome contrast with Mr. Bush's own appearances these days, and that it was not in Mr. Bush's interest to encourage such comparisons.'   Well, maybe. Certainly Bush isn't as eloquent as Reagan was. Then again, neither is John Kerry. When Bush speaks, you often imagine Reagan might have said the same thing better. When Kerry speaks, you imagine Reagan would disagree--assuming he could even figure out what Kerry was saying.    Update:  Holy shit, I've got  urlLink tears in my eyes .           "

The occassional terrifying ones do happen - mainly because of the demons you are forced to come face to face with. Well, the Queen is tired of dreaming but doesn't ever want it to end - so instead - she must know why it happens!! Why so often, why a certain dream over another - what part of your brain decides that?   Things to ponder and find out - this I am sure of. How do you dream? What do you dream?

2051,Aquarius,"                 My husband Alverice* came home from work today and found me lying on our bed in a fetal position, moaning and cursing the day I was born. Naturally, he thought I was dying. Then he saw the heating pad and the bottle of oxycodone and realized that I was just having period-induced cramps.  &nbsp;  Three weeks ago I had a laparoscopy to investigate my innards, specifically the innards that are related to producing babies. My RE (Reproductve Endocrinologist, AKA Really Expensive fertility doctor)&nbsp;found endometriosis on my ovary, bowel, and the back of my uterus - in endometriosis land, what they call the cul-de-sac. Because of the torture I endure every month, I was not surprised with my diagnosis. In a way it helps to know what's causing the pain and to know that I am not a hypochondriac. There's a cause for what I feel. So I'm glad I have some sort of explanation.  &nbsp;  Dr. Ambrosine* removed all the endo she could, using a laser (or possibly a light sabre), and also scraped some polyps out of my poor battered uterus. She warned me that my next period would be a doozy.

Check out her link to the right under 'Discussing the Point.'  Tonight Ked shared with me a conversation he had today with someone we've been bringing before the Throne. It was one of those conversations that sent chills down my spine. This person is truly seeking. Two months ago he claimed to be agnostic and possibly even atheist. Today he said he's no longer either. He believes there is a God. He's just trying to figure out where he fits into the God story. What sent chills down my spine was the realization that we can have influence and not even realize it. He informed Ked today that he's 'researched' Ked's family and come to the conclusion that we're for real. Apparently by 'research' he looked up all he could find about us on the internet. Somehow he came across our  urlLink Alaska  site and I'm guessing  urlLink Jest Kidding's  as well. He told Ked that what we did in Alaska and how we live our lives - in his words - 'you can't fake that $!##$.' I never dreamed when we put together the Alaska site that it would help someone see real faith in action.  It's so cool to watch this journey. Sometimes after being a believer for so long and surrounded by so many other believers we forget what that journey is like.  Humbled,               "
2053,Aries,"           The Second Coming  Turning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre will not hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere  The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity.  Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at hand. The Second Coming!  Hardly are those words out When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi Troubles my sight; somewhere in sands of the desert A shape with a lion body and the head of a man, A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds. The darkness drops again; but now I know That twenty centuries of stony sleep  Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle, And what rough beast, it's hour come round at last, Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?

2058,Leo,"       I am beginning to understand that faith is not the way around pain, it is the way through pain. Faith doesn't get rid of the opposition, it invites it over for dinner.

Faith doesn't give you the solution, it forces you to find it. - Mike Yaconelli  I love Mike Yaconelli...I never met him...but I can't help but think that we were kindred spirits....created from the same mold.....I resonate so much with this quote....I think sometimes we make our faith into a way to escape from our problems....like if I just sing loud enough and long enough and go to church everytime the doors are open then I will forget about how terrible my life is.....that is not faith...faith does not answer all questions...faith does not have the magic bullet in every situation...faith is a means by which we can attempt at trying to find meaning and purpose...it is not the answer to every question....the Bible didn't cover everything....I hope that we always remember that Christ doesn't fix all our problems...instead he gives us that boost when we desperately need it....

I finally went to bed about 2:30 a.m. (thanks to the coffee I drank before Life Group). I'm sleeping great and at 5:30 a.m. (right in the middle of my deep sleep) I hear a funny noise. You know how you hear an unusual noise in the night and in your grogginess you try to decipher if it's a noise you should be concerned about...This noise kept waking me up and soon Ked was up too. Then we both realize some guy is standing out on the sidewalk throwing a can (beer can) at our neighbors window. Tink, rattle, tink, rattle, tink....over and over and over!! Ked gets up and peeks out the window and there's this drunk idiot on the sidewalk who had apparently been kicked out. In a slurred bellow we heard 'you can't keep me out forever!!' tink, rattle... Had we been a little more with it we should have called the cops. This went on for like an hour. It was miserable!! Needless to say, I slept in until almost 11 this morning. Surprisingly once I got up I was pretty productive.  Tonight Ked and I hung out and rented a couple movies. We did the 2 movie, popcorn and candy deal at Hollywood video. We ate a whole bag of reeses pieces and we're both way too sugared up. We don't eat much sugar anymore, and that was way overdose. I don't think I'll need any sugar for a couple months! It was fun to veg on the couch together. We rented Matrix Revolutions since we hadn't seen it yet. We heard all the reviews and decided just to rent it. I'd have to agree with the reviews. It was a very poor ending for the trilogy. I almost fell asleep several times! We also rented Dickie Roberts Former Child Star. That one was pretty funny.  Well, I need to head to bed.

Maybe I needed this extra time to work on me, and my goals, and get myself together. I don't want to feel depressed, like I have been the last week or so. I felt so out of control. I've been able to make some good friends in the last week. They have helped me alot. I hope they know who they are :) !!     Last nite, before I went to sleep, I thought of cutting, I thought of suicide... and it was great to wake up and feel totally different.  It feels wonderful. Wish I could figure out how to feel this way..  at least 50% of the time.. I'd be all set.   Want to share a poem with you all..  Death  With this I could not stay I'm sorry it had to be this day.  The 13th of January 2004, It is the last day, I'm never more.  Too much sadness, Too much hate, This is the day, You learn my fate.  Forgive Please, I did not mean to hurt you Forgive me please, I have no virtue.  Only want to end this pain, Maybe for another to gain.  I felt really bad last nite, that is all I can really say. I thought maybe I would attempt suicide again. I wrote to my friend, Punky about my thoughts and feelings, and it will probably drive him crazy when he reads it, knowing he can't do a damn thing to help me. He has, though. Writing to him, gives me a change to be heard. Something that I'm not used to. It feels good to have someone I can open up to, and never be scared what I say will hurt him. Because I know, even if it hurts him, he will forgive me.. because I know he loves and cares for me so. I think the sad part of his life, is that noone knows what a good heart he has, but me. I wish I could of done something to help him before he got himself in trouble... I guess I just need to learn, that people need to learn their life lessons on their own, no matter what you say or show them. Thing is.. I never really said anything.. I guess at one point, I may have been scared. But..  that is in the past. I need to work on the future, and decide what it will be like. What do I really want. What will make me happy.    What would make me really happy right now..  is to cuddle up in my boyfriends arms.. and go to sleep. I'm getting really tired.. so I'm off. :)                 "

2074,Leo,"       I was taking a nap, but then, here it comes. The foreboding call through the house. I was almost asleep when it came. What's this? A sibling needs help with his scooter? Oh no! It's coming this way! Do the sleep act! Quickly I bury my face in the cushions of the couch. I need heellp. Please, hey, wake up! Hello? I try to filter out the calls for aid. Failing at that, I pull the cranky Lord-of-touch-me-and-you're-dead act, and lo and behold it worked. I settle back into my nap..Ah, it's been a good day. My friend came over, stayed up late working on a lost cause escapde  that had been destined to fail since we set out, then I had passed out on the couch. I woke up and took the role of couch potato, then talked to a few friends by way of keyboard, and then ate some food. As I contemplate all this I am rudely interrupted yet again by a more urgent call. My Wheel is coming off! So I grunt, get up, and come outside. AaUgH! The sun! I need my sunglasses. I come back inside, get my sunglasses, and it comes to pass that the bolt had broken. Therefore the wheel was coming out. In my great genius, I don't search for the same size bolt, but find a small bolt with and place large discs on either end. With help from a friend, I tighten the bolt and it works! I, am a skilled metal worker. Well, maybe not, but there is my episode for today. Tune in tomorrow...well, not tomorrow, just later. I'll put something else amazing here. Caio!          "
2075,Leo,             not a chance in hell         
2076,Virgo,"               I realised that though I write a lot of stuff on here, many of you won't know a hell of a lot of details about me as a person.  I know my profile doesn't say a lot, and thats the way I like it really, I like to be quiet and enigmatic, but now I feel it's time to come clean about a few things.   The two main things about me that people don't get to know straight off is a) I'm a diabetic, and b) I'm bisexual.  The bisexual thing most people get first, cos I'm prone to dropping some heavy hints  (usually along the lines of 'cor she's cute', or 'I'd do her!' maybe not quite so vulgar, but you get the idea).  The Diabetes thing is something I've lived with for more years than I like to remember, I was diagnosed at 17 months old, and I'm now nearly twenty six, so you can do the maths if you want, I really can't be bothered ;-)  My GP at the time, told my mother she was being neurotic and there was nothing wrong with me, I was 'only teething' apparently.  Fortunatley my Mum ignored him and got a second opinion or my life could have been much different, shorter for one.  Anyway, being diabetic sucks for the most part.  I kinda have it under control most of the time, but as with everything there's good days and bad days.  My addiction to cream cakes doesn't do it much good, but I've tried to cut it down to one a week ;-)   I hate being labelled, I am not 'a diabetic', I am a PERSON with diabetes.  I know I'm usually quite scathing about political correctness, but this is one instance where the PC lobby are right, just because you have a disability or an illness, doesn't make you that disability or illness, you're still a person, I'm still a person, just because I have a problem with my health...  :::gets off soap box:::  It's kinda the same with the bisexual thing being bisexual isn't the be-all and end-all, there are other aspects to my personality.   I first suspected I 'wasn't quite right' in school, probably about fifteen.  It scared the hell out of me, I wanted to be 'normal' like the other kids, but never really fitted in anyway with most of the other kids at my school.  It was at college that I finally accepted in myself that I was attracted to women and men, but even then I was afraid of people's reactions to it, and I didn't come out for ages.  I vividly remember the first person I told.  I'm not sure why I did then, other than the fact that I was a little bit drunk and needed to talk to someone.  I was pleasantly surprised by peoples reactions (tho as yet I haven't found a way of telling my mum and dad, there's not really any need for them to know while I'm seeing Pete), Everyone was really supportive and just took it in their stride.  A couple of people were surprised, but others just smiled like they'd known all along.  I'm happy in myself now that I can be open about it.  I don't know if that was my problem when I was in school and college...repressing how I felt, and not being able to talk to anyone because of fear, I felt so much better when I got it into the open...      Ahh I feel like I'm waffling now, ad I've probably said too much and bored you all.  Depending how I feel tomorrow about what I've said tonight there may be more, then again I may be too embarrassed for bearing my soul like that and never come back ;-)  Things to be grateful for... 1.  Beechams Powders 2.  Bacon crispies. 3.  Honesty and openess         "
2077,Scorpio,"       HAPPY BIRTHDAY KATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We had fun.  We went to Town Center and I bought Kate a shirt that said spin my driedel (lol)  and I bought me a new ring, and got yelled at for wearing it upside down...  long story...  don't ask.  Then we went bowling and scored like a 57 or something.  My name also changed several times through out the night  i started out rae rae, but then I was Poke (seriously, this 'let's watch Rachel cringe and laugh at her hysterically' thing is REALLY not funny.)  and then later it something else, and then VVVVVVVVVVVVV m...  again, don't ask.  Sama was having control issues with the computer, hah a We went back to Kate's house after that and watched 10 things I hate about you (one of my favorite movies, aaaaahhhh  Heath Ledger...  HOTTIE!!) and a Walk to Remember, and guess what, a TEAR ACTUALLY ROLLED DOWN MY CHEEK!!!  what is that, the first time since HYU? and I'm not even gonna go into what happened this morning,   I don't even really know, i just woke up with Chantele sitting on me, grinning evily, holding my cell phone...   I think she was harrassing Andrew...  UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     "
2078,Sagittarius,"       Some people were wondering why I didn't ask which  company  had the worst E3, instead of  which platform. Okay...  Now, if my main concern is console gaming, what do I care about how companies did with their handhelds? And vice versa. If I'm a GameCube junkie (or 'sheep' as they like to be called), I want to know what the bright sports were for the Cube, not the frickin' GBA.  In fact, with regard to console gaming, all that handhelds have succeeded in doing so far, are to  detract  from the enjoyment of console games. Any Cubers who were looking forward to multiplayer games over the internet &mdash; and are you gonna tell me that Mario Kart online wouldn't have been sweet? &mdash; can look at the GBA and Nintendo's push for GBA connectivity as the reason why it ain't happenin' for you. (Yeah, I know about Phantasy Star Online, where you've got to pay a monthly fee, and I'm also aware of the half-assedness of Warp Pipe.)  Then you have Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. Inarguably made worse by Nintendo trying to cram GBA connectivity down people's throats. Problem is, a lot of people just want to play their console games, not be practically forced into buying extra GBAs just to make it remotely fun &mdash; one Japanese publication even gave the single player aspects  a negative score !  Now you see why I separate these things out?          "
2079,Libra,"                 about two years ago, i left the hairdresser i had been going to for about 8 years. my hair is pretty difficult to deal with (v v fine), and i am too - i usually just ask hairdressers to do what they like, since i trust their judgment and don't want to admit that i want them to make me look like julia stiles.   (speaking of julia stiles, in an interview for tour guides i conducted today, a job candidate, when asked what celebrity he would like to be his guide, lucidly described why julia stiles would be the greatest guide. because she's not only beautiful and famous, she lives in residence at columbia university. so she's real, too. it was fantastic)   after i left my hairdresser (a move that it took me months to make), i saw another hairdresser a few times, but we just had no chemistry at all. so i changed salons. i've now gone through three stylists at this one salon, because they all keep quitting. maybe i should have never left michelle. i seem to have picked up some serious bad karma that i just can't shake.

2090,Gemini,"         AN on-air curse broadcast by CNN after US Presidential candidate John Kerry's nomination acceptance speech has left Democrats and network officials with red faces.After Senator Kerry's speech accepting the Democratic Party's nomination, balloons and confetti were released into the crowd.  But apparently there weren't enough for DNC convention centre director Don Mischer, who was heard on voiceover urging workers to release more balloons and confetti.  'No confetti. No confetti yet. Go balloons. Go balloons. More balloons. All balloons. All balloons. Come on guys, let's move it,' began a relatively calm Mr Mischer.  Soon afterward however the DNC director begam to panic.  'Jesus, we need more balloons. I want all balloons to go, goddamn. No confetti. No confetti. No confetti. I want more balloons. What's happening to the balloons? We need more balloons. We need all of them coming down... balloons.  'Go balloons, balloons... what's happening balloons, there's not enough coming down. All balloons - where the hell - there's nothing falling,' Mr Mischer said, before finally exploding: ' What the f... are you guys doing up there?'    Oh my, time to freak out America, there was a curse word (other than Mrs. Heinz' 'Shove it') muttered at the DNC, as the article reads, the director was trying to tell the balloon droppers what to do on a voiceover, and by the looks of it, got a little bothered by the lack of balloons.  Is this a big deal? not for me, it will prolly get very little airtime on CNN, because they are too busy Bush-bashing. On FOX it may be another story, especially on the O'Reilly Factor (Did I mention how big of an idiot Michael Moore(an)&nbsp; was during that interview), since Bill is a fairly hard republican, he himself evens out the partisanship on the cable news networks.

2094,Cancer,"       Good day, mortals. It seems that I have not been posting for quite a while for quite a good reason. Anybody watch the Memphis news? Or, even better, anybody in Memphis on Tuesday July 22? That's right. 100 mph straight line winds that snapped telephone poles like toothpicks and uprooted trees (the whole root systym) and knocked out the damn electricity for most of the city.  Fun galore. I am currently in Jackson, Mississippi, hiding from the boiling heat in the cool air conditioning of my granparents' home. Feel my power over nature.  I was flipping through this little poetry book I gave my granparents for a holiday and I am realizing how much the style I once adopted has changed. A sort of evolution, if you will. Somewhat weird. I felt it necessary to write for that reason.  By the way, this is to Elise, who dragged me from that mental wreckage I once found myself in.   A soul is sighing and crying alike Recollections of an old hand dancing Not dancing Stumbling along the computer keys Some edifice of a structured rhyming line Forgotten by now, an empty home When winds were whistling, I could hide there Light a candle Read Shakespeare Smell the hardwood floor and the aged sofa I won't return I have a new home to call my own My own Not my own, yours maybe I borrowed your style, tried to Loving thoughts that flow together Call it an emotion of jealousy Infused with that mindset of gratitude That is precise Gratitude for a rebirth Gratitude for a new awakening A renaissance, of sorts, for this time This time alone You brushed your pen across my eyelids And I inhaled alien air into my lungs A brighter poetry Where would my mind be if you had not Seen me Smiled Sat beside me in that classroom Called me up for a movie I feel that I am still wallowing An ocean of eternal undertow That's me See the speck in the blue, right there It's closer than it was Closer to shore Farther from drowning in despair and insanity Ani is there to comfort me, through my ears You are there to confort me, through my mind I feel newer I feel evolved Your friend believes I will do something Totally unexpected Entirely revolutionary Exploding from my silent cocoon I would not even be realized if I had not awoken You had not shaken my left shoulder and Pulled me onto the dance floor.

2096,Aries,"           Too many unanswered questions that I don't think will be answered in Episode III:  1)  Who was Jango working for?  On one side, he was the basis for the clones.  On the other, he appeared to be working for Dooku to assassinate Amidala.  But Dooku was building the droid army that the clones fought.  Was he just playing for both sides?  2)  Who was/is Sipha Dious?  My spelling is made up, and this question is not my own, but if you take out the 'pha', what do you have left?  Sidious.  Coincidence?  3)  Why was Palpatine/Sidious creating two armies that were destined to fight each other?  Did anyone think about the fact that the Seperatists may actually be the beginning seeds of the Rebellion?  If so, how ironic is it that the future rebellion was responsible for the death of so many Jedi?  All in all it was an ok movie, but I find myself agreeing with Johnnathan on a movie for a change.

2097,Cancer,"       It's a wonder it hasn't withered up and blown away.  This is why I don't have houseplants.  I wonder how my kids have survived?!

I'd rather waste my time reading about everyone else's seemingly cool lives.  I'm glad this year is almost over.  I hope that next year will be a better one.  It has to be.  I was dreading Christmas really bad.  I know it isn't about the presents and all, but tell my oldest two kids that.  I haven't always been able to provide them with a huge Christmas, but it has always been really good stuff.  This year my son came and crawled in bed with me Christmas morning.  He woke me up and whispered to me 'Mom, Santa came.  He sure didn't leave much.'  I wanted to close my eyes and either cry or go back to sleep forever.  One group present (a $35 DVD player from Walmart and a DVD) and one present each (a tshirt) just doesn't cut it.  Yeah, yeah, I realize there are kids who got far less, and that there are kids who don't have parents or at least mothers who love them like I do my kids... and that their dad and step-mom and his mom more than compensated... but that isn't the point.  I let them down.  I want better for my kids.  And I feel really bad that circumstances have been what they have been lately and this is the fallout.  Well, enough of that.  It's over and done and all I can do is hope that next year is better.  How was y'all's Christmas?  (Yes, that is too a word)         "

2100,Taurus,"           Just back from the 2nd MTB ride this weekend.  Let's just say it's been a weekend of pretty bad luck.  Yesterday, within 1/4 mile of the parking lot (on the way back) my buddy took a digger on about a 25 mph downhill right hander.  Fortunately, he wasn't injured, no blood, no mess - however, 5 minutes later, when we got to the car, what do I see but a fucking $64 parking ticket on my windshield.  Shit.  I had the $5 in my pocket to get the sticker, and simply forgot.  Booo.  Then, today, out for a nice ride - I went up this long mother fucker hill the fastest I ever have.  You know those times when you're working so hard you want to puke?  Yeah, that was me, half way up.  Heh.  Kept going though, suffered it out and kicked some ass.  Good times.    Then, on the way down another trail, I've got these new tubeless tires, so I'm getting used to what the tread can and cannot handle, and apparently the tires couldn't handle this one, loose, off camber turn at the speed I was carrying, so they shot me wide.  Into a cactus.  Hahahahah.  My left ring finger is nice and swollen, and had about 15 inch long needles sticking out of it, my left knee caught some too, with about the same number of needles.  Heh.  Picking those things out is a bitch.  Well, hope everyone's having a great weekend.  For all you east coast bitches, it's about 75 deg out here, and sunny.  Heard wind chill back home was negative 18 the other day - LMAO.         "

Mainly, they need to focus on 5% of the web's users who use standards-compliant browsers and then do some minimal hacking to accommodate the other 95%. Cough, Redmond, cough. Please make IE7  urlLink the best browser . :pray:  Anyway, thank gawd that the browser wars are (mostly) over. (Now, could we do something about our two-party political process! I'm all about the lack of standards when the two opposing parties are basically the same. Um, where was I?) That's right, back in the halcyon days of early 2001 when I took to the road, I tried to redesign my website from my car while doing 85 mph. Zogging while others thought zagging was cooler than zigging. Well, I quickly learned that my poor HTML 3 skills were not going to cut it out on the open road. That Adobe GoLive could only do so much and too much (bloated code). Too many of my friends were having difficulty browsing my site or even downloading it (not to mention uploading it from a 14k wireless modem). Well, the downloading/uploading problem was easily solved but the browser issues were another matter. I threw my hands in the air and awaited the web world people to get their act together.  The saddest bit about all of this is that the tools to obtain web standards, CSS (loosely: design) and XHTML (loosely: structure)*, were finally accepted in prime time when I eschewed my web presence back in late-Spring of 2001. I've lost three years! Had I been patient or not been so taken by, um, well her name is unimportant...  *Content can be achieved by a variety of means as can XHTML but it is all circular and above the reach of this post.   So, if you are interested in standards, I suggest stopping by the sites  urlLink A List Apart  and  urlLink Asterisk* , the latter seems to be the most focused blog on web design issues regarding standards.  Of course, I am only now crawling out from the waters of theory (read: I was reading books) and onto the land of practice (read: plowing through websites for quick tips as I quickly relaunch my personal website), so there is probably  urlLink a lot more out there  concerned with my standards interests (both arguments for and against) that I've not had enough time to read. Oh, but here's one funny, funny piece,  urlLink Gurus v. Bloggers 2  ( urlLink part one ), for those interested in the contradictions of 'practice what you preach'. Both these Design by Fire (DxF) articles have plenty of great websites listed.            "

2105,Leo,"             So my ice cream cozy was featured on  urlLink Cozy of the Week . If you want to knit one, too, here's the made-up-as-I-went pattern:  On size 5 US double pointed knitting needles, cast on 48 stitches, join, and divide among 3 needles.  Knit 3 rows in k2p2 rib.   Knit two rows.   Add in scrap novelty yarn and knit however much you want with that.   When you are about halfway done, k2tog after the sixth stitch on each needle.   Add more eyelash or whatever as you see fit. About 3/4 way through, do the k2tog decrease again.  For the next 2 rows, k2p2 rib, then cast off in rib. The last row should be the bottom of your cozy.  I'm thinking after I finish the second sleeve, I'm going to put my hoodie aside for a bit. I need to knit the Umbilical Cord Hat from Stitch 'n Bitch for a friend's new baby, then I think I'll knit up one of  urlLink these  cuties for Viv. I got some Lily Baby Cotton for next to nothing today at Joann, since my store is moving and they are clearing everything out. I think it will work well for both the umbilical cord hat and the tiny ribby tank. C         "

2107,Virgo,"   The following comments and further reflection upon them is found  urlLink here .  However, I am going to put them all on this post.     pduggie said... I think Wilson may have been interacting with Hortons article in MR to the effect that when we see that the torah gives commands that promise some kind of inherited blessing as a result of obedience to those commands, that demonstrates that the Torah is a typical republication of the Covenant of Works. But since Reformed theology has usually affirmed that the Torah is still a rule for living in the covenant of Grace, this would seem to be impossible for if we're under the CoG, we can hardly be bound to the CoW.      W.B. Myers said... 'I think Wilson may have been interacting with Hortons article in MR to the effect that when we see that the torah gives commands that promise some kind of inherited blessing as a result of obedience to those commands, that demonstrates that the Torah is a typical republication of the Covenant of Works. But since Reformed theology has usually affirmed that the Torah is still a rule for living in the covenant of Grace, this would seem to be impossible for if we're under the CoG, we can hardly be bound to the CoW.'The difference is 'why' we are obedient to the commands of the COW. Is it to inherit the blessings resulting in our obedience? Or is it because it is the express moral will of God, and we do it out of grattitude. No reformed theologian states that in our freedom from the covenant of works we are no longer bound by the morality of it, but that we are free from the condemnation of it. So, while the law is a typological covenant of works, we are still bound by it in the covenant of grace. One is performed out of obligation for a reward, the other is performed out of gratitude for what has been merited on our behalf.So, while we are not obligated to uphold the COW for a reward, we are obligated to uphold the law of God (which is used in the COW and COG--as per the three uses of the law taught by Calvin and Luther) in gratitude--hence the guilt, grace, and gratitude of Ursinus and the Heidelberg.    pduggie said... Well then I'm still left wondering, because it seems to me there are plenty of examples of the new covenant laying out an offer of reward for some kind of obedience.I can think of Paul's words to children, to Honor their father and their mother that their days may be long, which he says is the first commandment with promise, and John 15:10, where Jesus says if we obey him, we will remain in his love. Heb 10: 35-36 says that when we have done the will of God we will be richly rewarded.I'm not very comfortable looking at all these texts that seem to be motivating me to obedience through the promise of a reward, and claim that I should eschew the offered reward in the interests of only obeying out of gratitude (which ultimately, is the will of God for our obedience too)But then we're still left with a curious continuity between the way obedience is treated in both the new covenant and the older covenants.    Let me state that there are rewards for us who obey the moral will and law of God.  As noted, the first commandment with a promise is to honor/obey your parent that you might live a long life (Eph 6:1-3).  But the promise upon obedience is not the reward of the CoG, namely eternal life and salvation.  I beleive Hebrews 10:35, 36 is not talking about reward based upon obedience to the moral will of God, but the 'obedience of faith.'  I believe the obedience of faith is epexigetical, or that our faith (trusting and resting in Christ) is the obedience commanded of the New Covenant.  Remember, I also distinguish between the 'obedience of faith' and 'obedience to the works of the law,' as does Calvin (see his commentary on Romand 3:27).  Faith is not a work of the law, or obedience to the Ten Commandments.  The 'confidence' about which the author of Hebrews (who I call 'Not Paul') is that which is our assurance in the finished work of Jesus Christ, or faith.  It is through faith alone that we will receive the reward of eternal life.  It is faith alone that meets the obligations of the New Covenant.  I believe Hebrews goes out of its way to show this difference between the Old (Mosaic) and New Covenant.  The 'endurance' spoken of in Heb 10:36 is persevering in faith in Christ, who is the fulfillment of the Old Covenant (the Old Covenant being that to which the audience of Hebrews was contemplating turning).  We 'endure' through life through faith alone, which receives the reward.  Performing this 'will of God' is performing the conditions of the New Covenant: faith alone.  One endures the trials and tribulations, not turning from Christ to the law of God, but continually living a life of faith.  As for John 15:10, this is a more 'difficult' verse for me, personally.  On must also decide about whom this passage is speaking.  Is this passage speaking about believers and unbelievers in Christ?  Of is this passage speaking about believers--who will never go to hell--who will be 'judged,' not 'condemned'?  Though I am inclined to think this is speaking of those 'in Christ' through baptism, or members of the New Covenant (i.e. Judas Iscariot being the prime and contextual reference for being taken away/off by the Father), I would not say our remaining is based upon our obedience, but that our obedience (or lack thereof) reveals those who truly do and do not believe.  Before one jumps to this text, we must ask what it is to 'abide' in Christ.  For it is this 'abiding in Christ' that causes good fruit to bear, or obedience to the commandments of God (here it is identified as loving one another, summing up the whole law--John 15:12).  We must simply state the indicative (who we are in Christ) is assumed when speaking of the imperative (obeying Christ).  If we abide in Christ through faith alone, then we will produce those good fruits.  If we do not abide in Chrsit through faith alone, then we will not produce good fruits.  If we do not produce those good fruits, then it is evident we are not abiding in Christ through faith.  I am not going to state performing good works is the basis of receiving and maintaing his love.  We cannot say the reward of eternal life is based upon our personal obedience, but Christ's alone.  This does not mean our personal obedience does not play a role (forgive the double negative).  However, the sole ground and reason we obtain the promise of the CoG, eternal life, is the finished work of CHrist.  Our obedience merely testifies to our resting in Christ.  Our obedience is necessary for salvation.  It simply is not the grounds of our salvation.  This is a matter of ensuring the indicative always precedes the imperative.  "
2108,Virgo,"           I don't recall the last time I'd taken an entire summer off from anything, either school or work. Maybe when I was eight. I guess the next time I did so was this summer. And it's been the best thing I could have ever done for myself.   It didn't start off great. I was lying in shavasana, or corpse pose, in my early yoga practice when I decided, or rather my body decided I could no longer work where I was working. So I quit. Yoga was the beginning of all the awareness I've been having this summer. It's been a beautiful and wild adventure.   I am a believer of serendipidous acts. One thing leads to another. Answers are out there if you're looking for them and you pay attention to the signs.  I've made it my business to care about things my whole life. But when I cared too much it would adversely affect my life. If things didn't turn out the way I wanted it would rupture something inside me or it felt not unlike a cancer growing inside. It was horrible. The act of caring a bit too much is my vision ends up getting blurred and I have no idea what it was I was looking for in the first place. It's kind of akin to being an inexperienced web researcher. You go online and look up something very specific. There are 100's of hits. Not all of them have 100% relevance, but you go onto the site anyway. One path takes you to another. So if the search started with the bad effects of fluoride, say, you could by the end of 5 hours have accidentally entered yourself into a wet T-shirt contest in Utah. It's hard. Staying focused. For some. For me. So I've decided to let go.   Change is funny in most people. For me it's just a decision. I've decided to not care so much, and it sounds weird but it's working for me. I'm happier. I can love my friends more because I expect absolutely nothing from. And I can acknowledge all the love they can muster up for me. It's hard for most people to demonstrate love of all denominations. I'm a bit gifted in that realm. It's a good gift. So I think I'm helping, which is really good. And it feels really good. So that's good. Whole lotta good in a paragraph.            "
2109,Aquarius,"           Yesterday i was told that i am now Deputy head girl instead of the actually Head girl. I'm totaly pissed off, but oh well thats how it goes.   Did beach lifeguard training yesterday, swam a time of 7.09 min, and managed to do all other tasks required. The guys were nice to me. B has gotten well cute, and L2, mmm seems nice.   Today at work i was being wound up. Usually the supervisors jokily twist my words into something sexual, but it's not at all intimidating. But today it was really bad. The sexual references were much more direct. Starting with 'do you want me to spank your arse?' leading to 'come sit on my lap and give me a hug' and 'have you ever considered working at hooters'. This doesnt bother me that much, but isnt there a law about this, that boses can't actually make sexual references etc? And when 2/3 guys all direct sexual comments at me, then it gets a bit hard, Only having one boss taking the mick is ok, but i felt really uncomftarble with 3 of them doing it. I'm not leading them on or anything. All of them are engaged etc, and i'm not at all interested in D, Li, or the other bloke, but i dont think that ive led them on or anything.   This is a v.dificult situation, and it's getting worse. Any one have any ideas on how to solve this??         "

2113,Aquarius,"        I have wanted to do the  urlLink  Race For Life   in aid of Cancer Research for the last few years, two years ago I couldn't find anyone that would do it with me, and then this year I didn't think about it until too late, and didn't have enough time to get fit. So I have now found a willing friend and am in training. I know its a year away, but I would really like to have a good crack at running the whole way rather than walking. This is not to take away from the many people that do walk it, its all for a good cause but this is my personal goal.      As you know I am also trying to loose weight also, so this goal will certainly help me along the way.                 "
2114,Gemini,"           And all the time, and a lot of the time since, I wondered: Why him? It can't have been that I liked the look of him; it can't only have been physical, not that alone. Can it? Was it?  Maybe I loved him. I thought I did. As much as I knew what the word means.  How do you ever know? I used to think I would know when it happened. Know immediately, without having to wonder about it.  But all I knew for certain was that I couldn't get enough of him. I wanted to be with him all the time. And yet when I was with him that wasn't enough either. I wanted to look at him and touch him and have him touch me and hear him talk and tell him things and do things together with him. All the time. Day and night.  For instance: He would leave. I'd wait on edge for him to come back. People must have thought I had some sort of convulsive twitch because my head and eyes would keep darting towards the door every few seconds. But they couldn't have been mistaken what was going on, when Mr. Wonderful hove into view again, because then I went to pieces. Lost my grip entirely on what I was supposed to be doing and had eyes for nothing but him until I got used to him being there again.  Sounds like a pet dog. And I knew what was happening to me even while it was happening.  At first I tried to stop myself. But I couldn't. It was a compulsion, and obsession. Irresistible. After a while I gave up caring how I behaved or who thought what about me. Trying to hide how I felt was too much strain, and I wasn't succeeding anyway. I was just making a fool of myself. So I let it show, let it happen. I felt easier straightaway. More natural. More in charge of myself. If that was the way I was, I told myself, why pretend anything different?         "

2117,Capricorn,"           Hey,  The other day I wrote to Seema and Kat and got replies today so Im going to post some of their letters here first Seems:  I graduated from UT at the end of May.  Graduation weekend was wonderful- I had family come in from all over.  It was really sad to say goodbye to my best pals, but I guess that's life.  I have now moved from Austin back to Dallas where I'll attend medical school.  I got into my top choice school here in Dallas, so I'm pretty happy about that.  It's a four year program, and in my fourth year I'll apply for residency (specialization) programs.  I'll probably try to leave Texas for that, just to have a new experience.      I just got back from Las Vegas last night.  I went to Las Vegas to meet up with old friends and my family that lives there (I used to live in Vegas), and then we all drove to Phoenix, Arizona for our cousin's wedding anniversary party.  That part of the country is beautiful.  I had fun playing with all my baby cousins :)  Next week, I'm leaving to go to South America for a post graduation backpacking trip with three of my friends from college.  We're going to spend a month there, and travel to Brazil, Peru, and Argentina.  I'm very excited about the whole thing - it should be an adventure!   Besos,      Seema  And then Kat:  ....I haven't read the Bar Tomas blog in a long time too.  I hope you and the rest of the barcelona crew are doing well.  Well, what's going on with me...  This summer I've been interning at the state capitol with a representative.  She's the chair of the Border and International Affairs committee, and I've been doing research on Texas/Mexico border issues for the next legislative session.  It's pretty interesting, and I'm definitely learning a lot.  I don't know about a career in politics or anything, but it's nice to know that we could pass legislation that would address some of the problems there.  I'm also taking a couple summer classes, and taking it pretty easy-- hanging out with friends and my family.  My sister just graduated, one of my cousins got married, and another cousin graduated-- so lots of family stuff.    Regular classes will start back up again in August and then it will be full speed ahead until graduation (I forgot how busy things are here compared to Barcelona).  I can't believe it's my last year.  I'll be graduating in May.  After that I'm not sure what my next step is going to be.  Hopefully I'll get some job offers maybe grad school... who knows :)  I have a lot of mixed feelings I guess.  It's scary and exciting, but I'm ready for a change.    (then she replies to something I wrote)  No, I haven't been watching handball, but since you're such a sports fan, you should know that the Longhorns (My university's baseball team) are in the finals of the college world series!  It's pretty exciting!!!  So the 'world series' is a bit of a misnomer... since its basically colleges in the US.  Nevertheless, it's BIG TIME!  Well, that's all I have for now.  I hope to hear from you soon :)  Katherine         "

This morning, via IM, Jamie and I review and discuss. We're on the same page, which is good. Because of the time difference, Jared will respond later. Almost there. Meanwhile, Jason's father in law, Russ, who is an excellent songwriter and a dynamic guitar player, came in to Cracknation to play over a Chemlab song called 'Force Quit'. He laid down a KILLER guitar solo that takes the song up to a new level. Russ comes from that Lennon/McCartney school of songwriting and guitar playing and he understands the ins and outs of a song. The stuff he plays swerves through this song like a bird. Well done and kudos to Jason for bringing Russ in.  A rough version of www.hypefactor.com is back up and running. I have some new designs for it that should hopefully go up soon as well. Brandt should be appearing on here soon to give more perspective to all things Hype.  I refuse to discuss my utter dislike for THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN. Anna Poontang is responsible, though I would have seen the movie eventually. I'm dying to see PIRATES.

2123,Sagittarius,"        Gentle Reminder  Last night, while driving home after a yummy dinner at Sweet Tomatoes, I had what I thought was the misfortune of being caught up in traffic behind a v-e-r-y slow driver.  We're talking like 45 MPH when the limit is 55, and everyone does 65.  I was frustrated because I was trapped behind him for a minute or two, but was soon able to move into a faster lane.  Grrrrr....  But then, a few minutes later, the two left (fast) lanes slowed down to move around an accident.  An accident that had obviously occurred within the last 5 or 10 minutes.  There were 3 cars all crankled up together, and one man was lying flat on his back on the roadside, with a few people trying to help him.  Police and ambulance hadn't even made it there yet.  Suddenly, I kind of felt a little ashamed of my recent frenzy and frustration.  It may well be that, thanks to that v-e-r-y slow driver, I avoided being a part of this accident.  I just keep getting reminded that I don't always know the Plan, or what some other person has in mind.  I only know what I know, and I keep being reminded that I don't really know very much.

But at the same time I can't get rid of it, everything is stuck in me and doesn't want to leave, nothing will leave me alone, but I guess that's what they mean when they say you can't ignore how you feel. You can't, and if you try, it'll haunt you and hit you even worse. Don't ignore a situation, take it with you and make it better, don't ignore that feeling you have, in your stomach, in your head, or in your heart. Take all those feelings, compile them together to make something great that allows every situation to be possible. Make the best of something you have while favoring everything you feel. Don't say your head means more than your heart, don't say your gut means more than your head, just do something that wont hurt your head, heart, or gut while still helping you and others around you. Don't ignore other people or their feelings and don't be ignored by yourself.   It's the simple things in life we forget You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said Why do you make something so easy so complicated Searching for what's right in front of your face But you can't see it            "

2132,Cancer,"           Oh man this is why bio is so fun! Ok well at least this is why this chapter is so fun! Warning this is kind of graphic, but then again it is coming straight from my bio book:   Humans and several other primates are unusual in having no distinct mating periods; females are potentially receptive to males throughout the year. In humans, the sexual behavior called 'making love' may have evolved as a way to strengthen the bond between mates, as well as to promote the union of egg and sperm. Our sexuality is emotional as well as physical, and we have highly varied sexual expression.  The physical events of the human sexual respone occue in a sequence of four phases. During the excitement phase, sexual passion builds, the penis and clitoris became erect, and the testes, labia, and nipples may swell.  The vagina secretes lubricating fluid, and muscles tighten in the arms and legs. These responses continue during the plateau phase, which is marked by increases in breathing and heart rates. Orgasm follows, characterized by rhythmic contractions of the reporductive structures, extreme pleasure for both partners, and ejaculation by the male. The resolution phase reverses the previous responses; the structrues return to normal size, muscles relax, and passion subsides.  Hahaha, I love it, I really do. It's funny because I bet so many people have gone out and had sex after reading that, haha school makes sex sound exciting and 'enjoyable.' Haha, not too often school makes you horny, lol. Ok me done.          "

Spent the day with minime asking where her Dad was and why he was taking so long to see her. But made her smile and feel special no matter what. Talked to a few people today, old friends, new friends, special people.  I am sooooooo proud of my friend Sean for his marathon run today!! YAY!!!! I better get my butt in gear and get back in shape or I will never keep up hahaha.  So I was thinking (yeah yeah today I actually DID think) the whole concept of good karma and reaping what you sow. If energy can never be destroyed..maybe the actual energy generated while you are doing something for others is released somehow into the ether and one day will cause a positive reaction in someone else that eventually gets back to you. Likewise the bad energy too...meh...never know huh? Was an interesting thought though.

2140,Leo,"                 (That 'Argh!' is my lame attempt at a pirate sound)  Yesterday we had an 'optional' event in Criminal Law.  The professor invited us to come to school and watch the movie 'Pirates of the Carribean.'  Yes, the new popular one with Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom.  She brought food and everything, it was pretty awesome of her.  The relevance to studying Criminal Law was that our job was to try to pick out all of the common law felonies that occurred throughout the movie.    There were a ton of course--mostly larceny, robbery, and murder.  But were they really murders?  Can undead pirate be morally culpable?  Is it wrong for a human to kill an undead pirate?  Gosh I hope this isn't the stuff that's going to show up on law school exams.  I must admit it was more fun than talking about rape, which we've been doing for the last week or so.  It was pretty actually pretty uncomfortable.  Yeah, we are all adults (and most act like it), but there's something unsettling about hearing the guy down the row recite the much-too-detailed facts about three doctors engaging in group sex with an unwilling nurse.  Yuck.  I'm glad that's over.  I've got to finish reading about Wrongful Death and Pure Economic Loss for Torts tomorrow.  A group of us are having a cookout tonight--I never expected to hang out this much.  That's three times in the last six days.  You'd think we had enough to keep us busy.  I suppose we do, we are all just in denial about our looming exams (21 days away).  Let's just hope tonight is just dinner only.

2146,Scorpio,"             Well ok, I used to play tennis at this clay court here in Singapore. It's probably the only around, so many expatriates go there for training. I met many people there, the most memorable one was this Indian boy that kept whining 'It's just a game' when I beat him 6-0. There was this boy too, by the name of Alistair, that I used to play with quite often, because his training slot was around my time too.  His mom was such a nice lady, and he was really such a nice guy. When I stopped going to the courts, I never saw him again. Only today, 3 months after his untimely death, did I know about it. Apparently he went in his sleep, with no medical records, no problems the day before. The baffled the doctors, and they could find no reason.  My dad always repeats the same old catch phrase when someone dies so suddenly: 'frailty of life'. Honestly if he can't find something fresh to say then he should shut his trap, sometimes people feel better without the overly used 'words of wisdom'. But really this death was a real bummer. How could someone so young be taken so early with no rhyme or reason. He's about my age so I inevitably started thinking 'what if it was me?'  I really don't know whether I should feel upset or glad at his death. On one hand, this guy just left his single mother standing on the edge of depression with his death. From my very short time with him I could tell there was a lot of love between the 2 of them. When something like that happens you naturally feel a little upset, but this time the feeling's different. It's this warm, fuzzy feeling in my heart that tells me not to be upset. Well actually I don't know how to describe the feeling so I just used an old and cliched catchphrase.  Those who know me would also not know that I've been thinking about death ever since I reached a certain level of maturity. All along I had feared death, feared the pain, feared the thought of going to somewhere really, really bad. Then my thoughts matured, and philosophy came into play. I knew what I wanted from this world; nothing. I've all along wanted to die an early death of old age. All along I've wanted to live a short, meaningful life; and die a painless death. I thought death by old age was the ony way death would be painless, but this death has opened up a whole new dimension for me.   I really don't know why the thought of changing places came to me. I know if I were the one to die my family would be devastated. But they have my sisters don't they? Then again I've always been the special one. The more intelligent one. The one that has the most hope in life. That poor lady had and now has no one else. I feel so sorry for her, but what can I do? If the lord were willing, if he called out my name, I think I would really not hesitate. I think I would gladly swop his place for mine.   By saying that I'm kind of implying that I have a really bad life. That's really not true. I have a really great one, but if my death could do something so miraculously good as to bring mother and son happiness, I would gladly do it. My only wish is that that could happen without me feeling pain. I'm a sucker for pain.         "

Oh well. Ked is still feeling sick and he wasn't feeling good at all when he got home from work. He crashed on the couch and I called us in sick.  Anyway, not much to say tonight. My brain is pretty fried. I've spent the last few hours scrapbooking our Alaska pictures and I think I've hit my wall! I'm almost done with them which is absolutely amazing considering there were over 200 pictures to scrapbook! I'm pretty pleased with the album. It's so much fun to scrapbook all these amazing pictures that Ked took and remember what a great time we had. That feels like so long ago...so much has happened since then.

I think they just bought the cafe on West Main, they're caught up in the Downtown's barrelling renovation from sluggish mom and pop shops to bohemian paradise.&nbsp; The boy was tall and slender with brown dreadlocks poking in crazy patterns all around his head.&nbsp; He was cute in a pale, emaciated sort of way. His girlfriend was in a black and white swirl hippie dress with her hair pulled back long over her back.&nbsp; They seemed like they would maybe be interesting but from various experience in this town they're probably just struggling with an attempt to be big city cool in small town obscurity.&nbsp; Stephanie turns to me, sweet and naive Southern Stephanie who's only seen two real penises live and in person her entire 34 years and who didn't try a drop of alcohol until her 30th birthday, she says, 'They're scary, don't you think so?'&nbsp;   Oh, sigh.&nbsp; No Stephanie I don't think so.&nbsp; Where did I go so terribly wrong?&nbsp; Where did the road fork and I decided to trollop along the bland lines of these girls in their Old Navy wear and Black Eyed Peas CD's?&nbsp; What the fuck was I thinking?&nbsp; I know, I'm bitching, I'm not changing.&nbsp; The sad thing is... I know most of the time that I do not fit in with them, I listen to their stories of how horrible their men treat them and I listen to them whine about how poor they are. And all I can think is fucking knee him in the groin and walk out.&nbsp; Stop being so fucking dependent.&nbsp; Don't stay for your kids, you're teaching your children that abusive behavior is run of the mill in a marriage, you're teaching them that the women in their lives have no backbone, have no gumption to get anything done.&nbsp; And I'm thinking, you wouldn't have bounced that check if you hadn't have spent 30 dollars on a pizza last night. Go to fucking Schnucks and buy a five dollar oven bake.&nbsp; I've surrounded myself with people that need caretakers and I'm tired of playing mother hen to them. Fuck!   We'll even ignore all of these cardboard, by the wayside friends I keep during business hours and at bars, and let's talk quality and substance, let's talk Katie.&nbsp; Katie is on antidepressants right now.&nbsp; She's in the process of talking to a counselor.&nbsp; She's miserable, she's broken completely and all because of this piece of shit stupid fuck man that has painted her into a corner with napalm.&nbsp; And I want to hate him all day long and send death threats and make bomb scares and torture him with rain water, but really.&nbsp; It has come to the defining realization of dawning in my face... She stays with him and there is nothing that I can do.&nbsp; We can sit here and talk about the kids all day long until we're both bloated and angry, but the only thing that she is teaching her girls is that you need to stand by your man.&nbsp; Put up with whatever sewage he throws your way because it is better to have a man than to be alone.&nbsp; And I think, am I too preachy, am I working with convuluted logic because I do have a man, I am getting married?&nbsp; I don't think that I am.&nbsp; I work in a partnership. We both cook, we both clean, we both work to validate the other's feelings. Mike never comes home from work and grunts in man talk about why his dinner isn't set before him like a galant king. And I can't really see Mike ever telling me to make do after I got out of the hospital and I was facing surgery.&nbsp;   It makes me so fucking angry that my Katie has been reduced to this sniveling, groveling for affection, dependent gooey residue of her former self. She has no self worth, her entire worth is genetically binded with a man who genuinely doesn't give a shit.&nbsp; He's worthless. He is a walking paycheck. He adds no value to her life, he is just a representation of what she truly wants which is a partner that shares her beliefs and her attitudes and her quirky habits and one that will take an active role in her most important endeavor, her children. And I hate that she has locked herself into a loveless marriage that is doomed to fail because Katie will stick it out until there is nothing left but a bloody visceral gorey mess of her life.&nbsp; She will toughen up and internalize the philosophy that a failed marriage is a failure in herself.&nbsp; Not ever realizing that her only failure was ever marrying this ignorant fuck.&nbsp; I know that her new baby is a blessing that she loves her children more than anything on the planet, but I also know that deep down inside... the baby was the worst thing that could have happened. Before, Katie had a way out.&nbsp;       "

2167,Capricorn,              August 13th - August 22nd!!!      OH HELL YES!           
2168,Pisces,             yeah. quite cool lah. now i can take mrt back to jurong liao. no need rent car. but i think renting car better. faster. can stop by ppl's hse on the way. i dunno abt this guy. he doesnt even say hi to me now. he's such an asshole. i din say we cant be frens wat. school was ok today. lotsa work.  think tonight's gonna be a long night. study study study study. take care.          
2169,Capricorn,"           yes this is the title of the song i was looking for last post.  once i posted i thought 'why dont i just look for myself?', and lo and behold, i found it in about 1 minute (google search for 'hp commercial' + pictures).  it is called 'pictures of you' by none other than the cure (i knew it sounded familiar).  i actually found it on some message board about commercials...did not know of such things...no further comment.  anyway, its a pretty old song, but it is very catchy...hp gets great songs for its commercials, there is another one that i like, i am not going to search for it bc there arent any words to search for, but someone in the marketing dept deserves a raise (no my dad does not work there). went to the doctor today, he confirmed that it is a severe sprain, and that the earliest i could hit balls is in about a week, which would leave me with about 2 weeks to get into peak form for the beginning of the season...i wish this wasnt going to be my senior year bc i dont want to go out on a negative.  who knows, maybe it wont be, but 2 weeks without golfing is not helpful at all.  if i had to be injured, i would almost rather it be right before season so i would have a tangible excuse for the inevitable regression of my game that will occur (sorry about the bout of verbosity, i have to warm up for school coming up fairly soon...ack).  anyway, i would like to go chip and putt at the driving range maybe starting weds or thurs, who knows.  this is really making my summer more difficult than what i had planned.  my game seemed to be coming around, too...yes, i am quite despondent here.  its just that i have done the exact same thing every summer since after 8th grade (golf/caddy more or less every day and get about 100 rounds in each yr), and i really enjoyed that whole routine, especially now that i can drive.  now i have to otherwise entertain myself, and the only big positive is that i can sleep in.  i really hope that some higher purpose for this incident manifests itself soon, bc i am kind of annoyed about my situation. tomorrow i go to get my pre-senior pictures haircut.  thankfully i got my mom to schedule it about 2 weeks (a common time period for this post) before pics, bc i absolutely hate how i look for about a week after my haircut.  i guess that is pretty common actually.  speaking of senior pics, i have to go get a suit soon...i am plugging for armani! (what do you mean, $400 could be better spent on college?...) in addition to finding that song by the cure, another band i stumbled upon today (w/ a new release) was the polyphonic spree.  its kind of a rock group with a 20ish person choir.  very unique sound.  i had heard one song 'light and day' before, but i didnt know who it was.  i absolutely love them... urlLink check them out, you can listen to most of their songs on their website . i read a good chunk of 'rebecca' today (summer reading requirement) and it has gotten more interesting than the beginning.  its obviously written by a woman (not meant as degradation, i just noticed quite a few details/sentiments/other fantasies that no man i know would think of let alone write.  i will let you know how it progresses. one more thing:  if anybody can tell me a word made up of the letters A G O S, i would be grateful.  i cannot come up with the word at all, i even wrote down all 24 possible combinations, and none of them seem like words to me.  i am obviously missing something, and this will bother me until i figure it out.  help?? until tomorrow...

2170,Pisces,"       ................................................... wobbly teeth * celebrity dreams ...................................................  Tonight we were riding home from the grocery store when suddenly a LONG profound silence from Jaelyn pooled in the back seat.  I turned around and turned on the overhead light.   Have I told you before that my daughter who has the biggest, most beautiful brown eyes in the universe also has an uncanny ability to spill buckets of tears from those eyes at will?    I’m not talking about crying.  I’m talking about a unique ability to sit silently, wide eyed and cry tears so violently that her face is soaking within a minute?   The moisture is building in her eyes.  ME: What is it Jaelyn?   Niagra Falls.  JAELYN: I almost broke my tooth.  ME: You what?   Have I told you before that my daughter has the most astonishing oral fixation yet documented (in my somewhat limited experience with such things) in a four-year-old?  That she not only chews her fingernails and hangnails and dolls feet and hands and teddy bear paws, but also the sleeves of all of her shirts.  And what’s more – tonight, she decided to chew – to pull violently – to … I don’t know what she was doing…snapping her elastic black pants with her teeth?    And sure enough, one of her front lower teeth is loose.  It was such an interesting moment, because the flood of her tears came to feel like Eden lost...they were genuinely pentitent, but neither she nor I could do nothing to reverse the angels at the gates with the flaming swords.  Everythingteeth.com (or something like that) assured us that four year olds are the right age to lose their teeth (even if mother nature gets a bit of help).  I cuddled her on the couch as she sobbed after I explained that the tooth would probably fall out, and though she would have a hole in her smile, a new tooth would eventually grow.  Its amazing and horrible to feel the weight of a four year old dealing with the profound understanding that a choice she has made is undoable.   Is it true that in general, as a child, you get used to the idea that the world is not so much fixed as it is routine?  That all that happens may well be purged and cleansed by the next time around?  New Years doesn’t matter because years aren’t picking up speed and there's no great loss if you miss an opportunity this time, because it doesn't affect all the future opportunities you'll ever have....?  Freudian psychologists say that if you dream that your teeth are falling out – you’re fearing your own mortality.  I don’t dream my teeth falling out, but I have been dreaming ALL THE TIME of being on trips – to far away places – amalgams of places I’ve lived and places I’d like to go.  In every case, I run into old friends, and together we spend time with more recent friends.  And I know that something is about to happen in these dreams.    Oddly enough (this is very strange for me), I’ve had celebrity dreams twice in the last week.  Last night I was hanging with a bunch of friends (Burt, Brenda, Brendon, Natalie & Lynn) in a library that overlooked the Santa Monica Beach.  And what’ya know….guess who was there?  Jennifer Anniston!  She engaged me in some banter about the note I had sent Brad.  She’s been so funny about pretending that I’m really the snooty one to get to know – and people accuse HER of it! Imagine!  Two nights before that an old family friend that Lynn and I share – who just happened to be a dignitary in Iran before the Shah fell, asked Lynn and I to take Sheryl Crow to lunch at the local casino.  He wanted to get our opinion of her before he asked her to sing at a fundraising lunch he was having.  She was also very funny, really joking around and everything with us.    I’m not the guy who’s a star-f*$#er.  I really have very few parasocial relationships with media figures, and I’m only interested in the phenomenon of celebrity in a very distant objective way.    So what do these dreams mean?    Will Jaelyn’s tooth fall out?   Stay tuned in 2004   for answers to these questions…  …and more.  peace~     "

Anyway...i'm still working on my wire project. I'm hoping it'll be done tonight to show tomorrow.  It should've been done last Thursday, but, as usual, I forgot about it. I did finish my found objects piece for today though.  It's just a tree made of beans with a border of chopsticks. I'm not particularly impressed with it, but it's okay.  Currently, my favorite thing to do is check out website designs to see what's possible and maybe learn how to do it.    Ah well...still want lots of manga and anime...it's so pretty.  ^_~         "

That's an even earlier one, I'm not going to post anything in any type of chronological order for a while, until I run out of back logs. I'm just going to go through and post what I still like the look of.         "
2176,Capricorn,"             While I was online, I decided to visit my Xanga page and to check on my friend's Xanga pages and their updates.  I mean, I really do care.  hehe.  Anyway, I see Kevin's page and it was very angsty.  Apparently he failed his driver's test and was very bummed out about it.  Sometimes I feel like that.  You know, when all of my friends are able to do this the first time and pass and I can't I'll feel that I'm less of a person than they are.  I'm not as awesome or cool as they are since I failed my first time.  And I know how I hate people who just go and say 'Aww, you'll pass next time.'  I damn straight will pass next time.  No, I'm going to fail next time.  Pfft.  Anyway, I decided to comment and I thought about what he wanted to hear at that moment.  Well, I didn't know but I gave a really good attempt.  So I decided to curse him out.  I mean, its different, right?  Basically, I just told him that he will be the same person to me no matter what.  That there are more important things to worry about other than some dumb driver's test.  But I said those two sentences with a bit more energy.  Mixing words like 'asswipe' and 'fuck' a few times.  It was hard, I'm not used to cursing.  Hehe.  Other than that, today was my last day of forensics at La Salle.  I liked working on the electron microscopes.  I do wish the Professor will send pictures he took of the whole event soon.  I could totally post them on my journals.  Wednesday night, one of my neighbors decided to ring the door bell at 9:00 at night.  It was really unexpected.  She said that she had always looked across the street at our house and had always wanted to talk to us.  But she didn't know how.  So she decided to today.  Or tonight.  Wednesday night.  Sure, whynot.  She likes the artchitecture of the house.  And stuff.  Cool, I guess.  A few minutes later, my next door neighbor knocked on our back door and announced that there was a family of skunks living under our shed.  Right.  Well, the next day, we investigated.  Well, we didn't investigate too much because I was afraid of getting sprayed.  But we didn't find anything.  *Shrug*.  Maybe they moved out.    Cool beans.         "

2180,Taurus,"             Today we are in the computer lab and we are supposed to be doing anything we need to pertaining to writing.  I'm not yet comfortable enough to blog on the wp blog page, so I thought I'd start by blogging here.  (I can't believe blogging is a verb! lol)  Today has been a great day so far- even thought is started out with my stepping on one of Lucy's bones and having it go   into   the bottom of my foot.  It couldn't have been in the tougher heel part... noooo.... it went into the softer part between your toes and your heal.... the arch I think is what it's called.  This morning we worked in groups to think of symbolism of the writing process.  It was a hoot!  I just happened to have a bunch of pictures of Lucy and Sharon suggested we compare the writing process to grooming/washing a dog-- it was so much fun.  I am learning so much as I participate in this project.  I also think it's pretty cool that the writing project I'm participating in is part of the National Writing Project!  I just think that is so neat.  We have to submit two writing pieces to the e-anthology for the NWP.  I'm not too confident in my writing ability, so I think I'm going to do a poem.  That way I won't have to worry so much about grammatical errors and mechanics.  I can just put my ideas down.  I'd better get writing....         "
2181,Aquarius,"       Of course I've thought about it happening.  I've envisioned how it would happen and what I might do.  I've considered that I should devise a plan if it happened, just to be prepared.  Well, it happened and I had no plan, no diagram to show me what to do.    This morning I woke up with a headache thinking, as I do every morning, that I just want to get back in bed, I want to call in sick.  But, I never do call in sick.  I turn on the coffee maker, get dressed, fix lunch and when the coffee is ready I begin sipping it while quietly saying a prayer that my empty stomach will except the legal stimulate and take it straight to my brain.  This morning, the coffee couldn't work fast enough and the headache required 2 ibuprofen.  Praying to the over-the-counter drug gods that the medicine too would go straight to my brain, I began looking for my keys.  I couldn't find them and my head hurt too much to search really hard.  So I grabbed the spare set with it's spare car key, spare car remote clicker thing, and spare apartment key.  The clicker thing was the slightly used one I had traded for the unused one a few months ago thinking that the battery in it had run it’s course.  It's a sad little keychain with only the three danglers, but it would have to do, I was running late.    It was a wet morning and this time I remembered my spare umbrella in case the heaven's opened up on me as I went from school to school.  I stepped out of my apartment, coffee in hand and as I approached my car, the spare clicker wasn't working.  I figured its tiny battery was in fact dead and opened the driver's side door with my key.  I then tried to manually unlock the rear doors by using the power unlock button on the driver side door (I know, not really manually).  Nothing happened.  I was confused.  I hopped in, put my bags on the passenger seat, set my coffee in its holder and put the key in the ignition.  Upon turning it, I got nothing.  I mean nothing, not even the usual piddily sound the altenater makes when it’s trying to charge the battery when in fact the battery is dead.  All signs were pointing to a dead battery, but no noise, that was strange.  I was confused and then remembered how the ignition had been acting funny the last few days.    Here is where I needed the plan and had none.  I first said a quick thank you to God that I was a support teacher and did not have a classroom full of kids waiting on me and then a bit of panic set in.  What do you when you are almost late for work as it is and everyone you know is probably at work already.  I called my brother, he had to take the kids to school and even if he could get me to work I couldn’t travel to my other schools and I'd have to take care of the car today anyway.  So, I had to call in.  I was getting my early morning wish, but really, this was not the way I had wanted it.  Having no plan I couldn’t figure out how to call in: Do I call in sick or is this personal business?  Do I call in for a half day and hope my brain clears and I figure out how to get to school for the last half of the day?  Who can help me?  How long with AAA take?    I ended up calling in for the whole day.  Car troubles have notoriously taken whole days before so I thought I would play it safe and not confuse the day even more by having to try to get to school by a certain time.  It all worked out.  The dealership was able to (expensively) fix everything by the end of the day and I can go to school easily and safely again.  I'm just wondering, do you have a plan if it happens to you?          "

2183,Libra,"       Argh.. so tired today. Went out for my birthday last night with friends from school and ended up at this break beat dj's set afterward... didn't get home til about 4am and woke up at 9ish...  They asked me what I wanted for my birthday and they got me 2 cds (which i requested) and this make up bag thing too for my pending trip overseas at the end of the year. Its pretty cool - its a surf brand one. But its just not really my style. But it is the thought that counts..  though.   I was supposed to clean my room and study today but as you can imagine i am sleep deprived and lying around falling asleep everywhere..   Its been a busy week..i got a lot done - i got my haircut and my nails done too so i feel pretty special..  also went to gym twice, worked two days and attended all classes, tutorials, and had my final commerce presentation ever... and handed in a 3000pg group report..  yay!!   going to rest now... @_@ i feel like a zombie... >.

2184,Cancer,"       I hath returned from my travels to the far away land of colleges. And allow me to say, the land is so fucking confusing that I will run to my room and curl into a fetal position. I visited furman, clemson, and emory. The first two are extremely pleasant. The last one is questionable: Atlanta lives on Emory's goddamn campus. So that location is questionable. But anyway. We spent a lot of time driving with our butts stuck to leather seats.  I am back though, and the second I entered my house I got dizzy. The humidity of Memphis, it seems, is not exaclty salubrious to my physical state. Amber agrees. Lovely thing, her. I am going to steal her away from hr parents and hide her in my room so she won't have to leave.  I don't think the medicine is working anymore. It has been doing nothing for the past week, so I shall be discussing with Dr. Price some variation of the stuff. It seems to be causing fatigue in addition to not working. Wonderful. Might as well overdose on advil for a similar effect.  I wrote a surprising lot on the trip. Two of the items I posted on DOY. The piece here I wrote Sunday morning, before we left, and I asked the manager to give it to the actual Robert. I think it made him happy. I dunno, though, as we left immediately after:   Robert, out waiter, has the soft eyes and the melted smile of a man who understands his relationship with people. He works when he can, but seems to value talking to someone. When speaking, his eyes wander, and his voice is beautiful: sad, somehow, and somewhat raspy.  Robert, it seems, is still a kid; he knows this, and how it affects his customers. His gentle chocolate skin always shifts into a smile when he talks about driving to Rome daily for his nightly work, after his shift here ends. And though he is just one picture, Robert, has become the fragile part of a web in this intimate community. He has painted the road to the paradoxical power plant in the fields, and the quiet wood and iron bridge, and the tiny shop of pizza and peanuts.  I wish he would write about who he is. Robert's story would be a series of pictures.   Heather, why the hell are you in Oklahoma? Alanna and Katherine and Brock and Miles and Amber, we need to do fun stuff before summer is over and we are dying in the senior year that precedes college.

2185,Scorpio,"       Ok, this song really is beautiful...  its a duet on Matt Maher's cd called 'Set me as a Seal'  Set me as a seal on your heart, set me as a seal on your soul, for strong as death is love, unyielding as the grave.   Nothing will quench its flame...  nothing will quench its flame.  kiss me, my love that your name be on my lips. You intoxicate my being with the fragrance of your presence.   How beautiful you are my darling.  Show me your face, let me hear your voice.   Sweet as the dew in the early morn, like a lily among the thorns.  I looked for you, the one my heart lovew.  I looked for you, but did not find you.  I searched through the night until I rested in your sight.  NOw I will never let you go.   You have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride, you have stolen my hear with one glance of your eyes.    Your lips are so sweet, adorned with honey.  My hands, they drip with myrrh.  Set me as a seal on your heart, set me as a seal on your soul.  For strong as death is love, unyielding as the grave.   Nothing will quench its flame.    I actually got to talk to Matt Maher at NCYC... which was really cool, and I told him I absolutely loved this song, and he explained to me that its not just about a boy and a girl, its actually about the relationship between God and the Church/his people, which I thought was amazing...  I've listened to this song like five times today... the harmonies are stuck in my head.  oh well.      "

Then the next day, my kids, wife, Tom, & his kids went to see it in the afternoon in Appleton!  The kids all really enjoyed it & I'm thrilled that I personally had a chance to see it two times!!  Go get em Spidey!  Well, case you were all hanging in supense, I signed back up for StarWars Galaxies.  I've been playing with my bro on his server Corbantis, I'll be shooting to try to be a Smuggler over there.  Gives me something to do late at night & a chance to sort of 'hang out' with my bro!  Well, 4th of July is right around the corner.  I dont have any real plans, maybe Saturday night (the 3rd) I'll try & see some fireworks somewhere, seeing that I have to close HW on Sunday the 4th... YAY... for me!  One last note, one of the guys from HW Som, borrowed me a Japanese animated DVD set called 'Hellsing'.  I'm a big vampire fan so I was interested in watching it.  It's a 2 disc set, but Japanese Anime is usually not my 'thing' but I have to say I really enjoyed the series!  It's a 13 parts & apparently is based on a comic in Japan...  If any of your HW peeps are reading this ask Som to borrow it or ask him more about the plot!  Arucard, was the lead vampire, & he is one deadly mofo!  Happy 4th of July to everyone!  *May The Force Be With You*           "

We're not called to lead the easy life, we're called for greater things, to be dynamic infusions that pervade humanistic, hedonistic society...to Live.

2189,Gemini,"        Hello!  Things have been looking up lately, wife & I are doing great.  Think both of us are trying to be more attentive to one another.  So that is always a good thing.  Maybe things will be better overall for me!  *crosses fingers*   Kat, (wife) bought me a new wedding band today, that was good!  The old one was loose and I do not particularly care for gold and the old design.  Now it's just a plain silver band which I like a lot more!  I'm not a big jewelry person in general, this ring does not 'feel' like I'm wearing one like the old one did?  Maybe I'm just weird.  Had a falling out, sort of with Branden & Nick at HW, guess it was just a misunderstanding.  Things are back to 'normal' on my end, & it seems that way for Nick & 'B'.  'B' really bailed me out tonight when another guy did not know he had to work, so that was waaaaay, cool in my book!  Was a good night working with Schaefer & him talked a lot about movies & videos games.  Was all good, one of the better nights lately.  Have off Wednesday & Thursday, that will be odd.  Kids coming on Wed. so that should be a great day.  Will have to figure out what do with my Thursday, maybe go play some Hero Clix with some of my friends during the day.   Decided to take another 'collection plunge' by expanding my Hero Clix that I will be buying, to not only the Marvel realm, but also the DC.  There are so many neat looking figures out there that I've just decided that I cant afford to have a few of them also!  Sides, it's sort of like any collection, got to find more more more!  Too bad, Nick & Greg from HW dont play regularly it would be fun to have new players to chat with & play with.  Ah, well off to bed, long day tomorrow Taco Johns and HW here I come 11-2 TJ  3:30pm- Close at HW...           "
2190,Aries,           if i don't cut it out i'm gonna kick my ass i mean it         
2191,Libra,"                 yesterday, my mom held a party for my nephew brendan. he was born 2 months ago, so i'm not quite sure whether this is a shower. about 20 people came out to see him, which was great. as my mom would say, 'well, this turned out nice, didn't it?'. Okay, she actually said that, roughly 6 times. my extended family is hardly tight-knit, so it was good to see people i don't get to see very often.   my sister (brendan's mom) had everyone write brendan these 'letters to the future,' to be opened on his 25th birthday. the kits are sold at most hallmark shops and the like. I just turned 25 last october, and i don't know what i would have thought if i got a batch of messages from the late 70s (when i was born) - wow, a piece of my family heritage! this is kinda lame. or check out these old 70s typefaces. graphic design has sure moved forward since then.  or who was this person? to be followed by a long tedious explanation of how they fell out with my family in the early 80s. or how many of them would just say 'have a nice life'?  the best response to my sister's urgings came from my grandma, who when asked if she would like to write Brendan a letter responded 'why? he can't read yet.'  she wrote him something anyway.  i left wondering for whom are these letters being written? we're assuming brendan will care, but for the moment, he's just drooling. maybe he can point to them as proof that his family loved him and he's not adopted? but it'll be a little late for that - those taunts usually end about age 12 or 13. the whole time capsule phenomenon seems to date back to cold war united states, or at least that's when i think it was popularized. in my mind, i associate it with backyard emergency shelters stocked with tinned food. the time capsule provides the security that everything will be alright. perhaps when brendan hits 25, his ties to mom and dad will start to wane, and the presentation of this time capsule will be intended to pull him closer to his family.      i dont' want to think about it too much - i haven't got the time.   yesterday i realized i shouldn't be a mother - brendan sneezed whilst i was holding him and instead of saying gesundheit i said 'ew'.

2192,Libra,"       In 1976 - 10 years after its opening - the Iraq Museum published a catalogue with a mission statement. It read: 'The relics of the past serve as reminders of what has been before, and as links in the chain of communication between past, present and future. The society which possesses many and fine museums has a correspondingly stronger historical memory than the society without them.'  I wonder how much of that museum stil survives... and I also wonder who is to blame for all the destruction...         "

2198,Aquarius,"        Hello world!,     My name is Conor. I am 14 years old and I live in Pittsburgh, PA. I have an awesome job at the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. I do have to say I love life, and all the people in it. My life long motto would be 'Live Life one day at a time.' Original Huh? I live with my Parents Dan and Denise, with the addition of a sister ( Katie.) I have two life long best friends ( Meghan and Katelyn.) And they are really cool to be with. My most recent friends I have made were Sari and Chris ( co-workers.) Now all of the Visitor Services staff ( and Zoo employee staff ) have been really nice, and are also friends. Sari and Chris are just my two Best Freind Zoo buddies.     Now this would be a Blog without telling what happened today!       August 19, 2004    Today I woke up to cloudy Pittsburgh weather, I though I was going to have the day off, but little did I know that it wasnt supposed to rain untill later that night. So I had to rush at like 10:10 am to be able to get to work at like 11 a.m. Finnaly I was ready and my cousion drove me to work. Well today I had to work on CoGo's Sumatran Express ( its alil train thing that is an attraction for Zoo visitors.) Well I love the train to death...but today was not it's day. I was tried the dumb thing kept smoking and it rained twice so we had to shut it down two times. Well me Phil ( Train Driver ) and Chris ( Read^Above) got our luck when we did'nt have to take it to the barn, then walk back. It rained very heavy for about an hour and is still drizzling as I type. Again thats Pittsburgh Weather. Anyways I have to go right now, beacuse I work tommorow again on the Train.... Please Let It Rain!        "

2200,Leo,"       At first, I had attempted to write a poem, but I decided to leave that to people that are actually gifted.  I felt inspired yesterday when I saw the clouds rolling around, but today......I just don't have it.  But there are storms here.  Oh yes, storms a plenty. I have been driven to my storm shelter 4 times this year.  They call it Tornado Alley for a reason. As opposed to other places like 'Missouri, land of discovery' or something like that.  I can discover something in montanna if I wanted to. But I don't, so haha. If you think that was a bit odd, please read the disclaimer in small print at the top of the page.  Now you're going to look at the top of the page and see what it says.  I actually don't know that for sure; just a guess.  And this has gone all over the place.  Back to storms.  I love storms. Some people don't. I love the rain, the smell of the storm before it strikes, the color of the sky after the clear, sounds echoing throughout the entire enduring cell.  Lightning with flashes so bright that you are blinded in the darkness that surounds you created by the presence of the clouds. Other people that don't like storm are a bit odd to me.  Great way of displaying God's creation.   It's pitch black outside.  But you know what they say, it's always darkest right before it goes pitch black.  So now, I'll have to leave the rest of this space empty.....just like outside.....except outside it's black and not empty, and here it's black and empty.  So decided which one you want to believe.  Chaio!         "

He stays in the attic until everyone is asleep and then does it.  I'm not sure where I came up with that theory but it's possible.  Not likely but possible(cmon it's a dream).           "

2211,Libra,"           Okay,  so I found the magical wonders of xanga, and I must say, they've won me over. But I know some of you kids out there read this thing, so for the hell of it, I'll update.  So Cups, this one's for you. I think I'll start by giving you the expo on wensday, since it was rad and I heart it.  We left the house at 3:30 and go there at almost exactly 5. It was down at Blossom which was really nice. Then I found out I couldn't of taken in my camera because they don't allow it. And because it was pouring we had to take raincoats. (Yeah, it stopped raining about 20 mins afer we got in.) Then we watched Auf Der Maur. The lead, Melissa is the ex-bassist for the Smashing Pumpkins. Who,  in her age still rocked like a mother. I couldn't believe how rad she was. She is now my vanilla!  Then we watched Thursday, who is amazing live. Didn't expect that great of a job by them at all. Plus it was the last day of the tour for them, and they we're filming a rock movie called 'God's Lot,' (btw, second stage was in a parking lot.) After that (when everyone else left for a while) I stopped by and talked to him, Geoff, (lead of Thursday) for a good half hour. He's such a sweetheart, it's great how he listened to me. I wish I had more people like that around me more often. Gave me some good words of wisdom. Then came Muse. Oh dear dear me. I was so bloddy excited for them to come out. Okay so the stage wasn't more than the width of a classroom. Maybe a tad bit more. And where I was standing I was right on the baracade, and I was in front of Matt. Who I could easily drool over, let alone sweaty and with a rad guitar.  So they played, Hysteria, New Born, Butterflies and Hurricanes, The Small Print and Stockholm Syndrome. I was a bit dissapointed because I didn't get to hear 'Plug in Baby,' so what I did, was I yelled it really loud, as they were still on stage, and then the group of about 10 forigners screamed out was sounded like, 'Ploog En Bah-bay' but it was just there accent. It was still great. So they stopped, looked at each other, and came back on, and played it. I was so happy. Oh yeah, after Stockholm Syndrome, and after the riff thing they played after,  Matt was on the ground right in front of me, so when he stood up he was like, 'hugs for everyone,' and so I gave him a big hug, and kissed him on the cheek! (you only live once right?) and then he looked down at me, and was like, 'alright then,' and gave me a kiss back! I thought I was going to die. but I didn't! Then we decided to catch The Cure, who by all means suck live. Its like all stoner/elevator music. Horrible. So we left after the first 2 or 3 songs. It was like, 10:30 by the time we got out, and we wanted dinner, so we went to Denny's where we ended up running into Melissa from Auf Der Maur, talked to her for like 10 mins. then ate, and came home. Sound great? Yes! It was!          "
2212,Gemini,        The Miami   Dolphins   Beat the Buffalo Bills to go 2-1 on the season. wOOt!!!!           
2213,Taurus,"       Thoughts about the weekends' happenings in sports:  Ken Griffey Jr. of the Cincinnati Reds FINALLY got homerun #500 versus the St. Louis Cardinals on Sunday.  A lot of people have been asking, 'Well, should Griffey make the Baseball Hall of Fame?'  I don't even know WHY people are asking the question: of COURSE he should!  Consider the numbers, first:  Only 20 players have ever hit 500 or more homeruns, and now he is one of them.  That's an elite group in my book, especially being the *6th youngest player (age 34) to accomplish the feat.  Griffey was also the youngest to get to 400, which is significant because it proves how much injuries over the last 4 years have really messed up a potential for a HISTORIC career, rather than a great one.  His career numbers, as of now: a .293 career batting average, .562 slugging, a .378 On Base Percentage, with 2143 hits and over 1438 RBI.  He's only 34!  Plus, he WAS the star player of the league in which he dominated (with Seattle) from 1993-1998.  AND he still has a good shot in the next 5-7 years of winning a ring (maybe even this year the way CIN has been playing).  Yeah, I think the guy deserves to be in the Hall.  Fred McGriff on the other hand, has played to long (19 years) and STILL doesn't have #500 (493), his RBI numbers are way too low for his career (1549), and he's just not as had an impact on the game compared to others that got in.  He is however.....  ....ON the hottest team in basbeall, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays!  Can you believe these guys have won 11 in a row?  I didn't even know until this morning that they won YESTERDAY, never mind 11 in a row.  Too bad they play in the toughest division in baseball. They are 32-34 this year and 10/5 games behind the Yankees.  But hey, where else can a fan feel good while saying, 'Look, we're ONLY 10.5 games out of 1st place!'  All in all, just be glad that Lou Pinella won't have a heart attack for another 4 days........  Noting that milestone, it also makes me cringe that the Red Sox are now ONLY 6 games above the Devil Rays in the AL East.  I'm not panicking (or at least not trying too), but the Sox usually make a June Swoon each and every single year, especially during interleague play.  I think, if you are a fan, the things you have to focus on the most is that we now have Trot and Nomar back (and they're starting to play better), our pitching is still better than the Yankees (but their offense is WAY superior, kinda the opposite of last year between these 2 teams), and the fact that if you're talking Wild Card, that Texas (a good, young lineup that has average pitching) and Anaheim (a team that was my pick to go to the ALCS earlier in the year, but with all of these nagging injuries around the roster, as well as suspect starting pitching, they'll be lucky to finish 3rd in the tough AL West) are struggling, and with the Minnesota Twins/Chicago White Sox (It's like division 1-AA compared to the other tougher division in baseball) 'battling' it out in the AL Central, I think the Sox will be OK.    They just need to make sure they win each series against Minnesota coming up, and the Yankees at the end of the month.  It's a marathon, not a race......  .....finally congrats to South Africa's Retief Goosen on winning his second U.S. Open in Golf on Sunday.  I watched and laughed as Phil Mickelson completely had a brain fart on the final two holes and not only lost the Open, but also the chance for a Grand Slam (winnign ALL FOUR major tourneys - Masters, US Open, British Open, and the PGA Championships).  This guy has blown more big shots than Tera Patrick on a glory hole video.  Good thing he won the Masters last month, otherwise ALL we would be talking about is how much of a choke master he is.  He's still making more money than most people combined, I think he will be fine.  One thing ALL golfers must be happy with: Tiger Woods becoming a non-factor all of a sudden.  After dominating the last few years, he hasn't even been CLOSE to any of the major titles, never mind winning them.  He barely made the cut this time!  Maybe Tiger needs to go back to the Army to train, 'Abu-Gharib ' style, or maybe have Nike make some super golf shoes or something.

2214,Scorpio,"              Epitaph  Picture a quiet graveyard in the long-distant future, with craggly grey stones, the smell of green green grass, the trees overhanging as the sun streams through in the fading twilight.

2217,Pisces,"       Lynn turned me on to this book that we’ve both been loving this summer – James Paul Gee – writes about   urlLink social linguistics and literacies   which is situated exactly at the intersection of our interests (she researches / teaches about adolescent literacy).  So anyway he has these great labels for concepts that have circling in this blog (and in my discourse) for a long time.  He talks about that language use is always rooted in motivations of STATUS and SOLIDARITY:     Status and solidarity are the competing, conflicting and yet intimately related fields of attraction and repulsion within which all uses of language are situated.   And then he goes on to probe how indicative your use of the oral –in’ or –ing demonstrates which of these dialectical poles you’re featuring more in that particular speech episode.  If you’re endin your words with the “n” – than you’re seeking solidarity – with the “g” – you’re positioning yourself for status.  Now use of this code (or any other linguistic criteria) is dependent upon your social circle, because there are many circles where the use of the “g” is a bid for SOLIDARITY and STATUS.    But these two poles do  again  mark out the powerful opposing urges to be a part of something (to be “in”) and the urge to be unique (“be yourself, no matter what they say…”)  And this feels like a particularly keen truth when it comes to the point that Nathan makes in his blog:    Can one really affect the world one person at a time? That is just not good math. […]In order to change the world, you must be able to affect systems. In order to affect systems you must have the backing of institutions. In order to get backing you have to sell yourself to something. I dabbled in everything in college; track, choir, drama, residence life, debate etc...but I liked everything so i did not sell myself to anything. Consequently I have not affected any systems.   To have cache you have to (as Mandy puts it) “sell out” , but to make real change – to subvert the rottenness of existing status – you have to be able to maintain a sense of seperateness…  so many implications...

2218,Aquarius,"                 Wishing I could get my comments to work. Still can't.  Mike, help me!!!  I put the code in right!??!? I think. THE stupid side bar thingy.. the code was in right for his web site although it wouldnt ever work for me. The other day, I just looked at the code, it looked right, and republished it. .. and it worked.. AMAZING.. blah blah blah..    Anyway...  I think too much. Had a lot of thinking I could do though today, as I drove like for 5 or 6 hours today. It wasn't too bad of a drive and I got to help my friend D. get home with her new Baby Emily.     So, I've come to the conclusion..  (at least my opinion today--I tend to be fickle lately) That.. I cannot marry a man that thinks I'm fat. Ok.. not a big deal to some... but I've never had an issue on whether a man finds me attractive. I've always felt pretty (though I am too chubby), and never had a bf tell me different. Sure the boys at school picked on me a bit, but I always had a smartass comeback,and it never bothered me that much. Maybe cuz I wouldn't be having sex with them or anything. I mean.. I don't want to be making love to my husband.. and not enjoying it, cuz all I can think of is him saying, 'Julie, You are fat, lose some weight, she lost weight, so go write that down on how she did it'. I said it once, I'll say it again.. FUCK YOU..  I said that to C. Apparently hurt his feelings, but hey..  It hurt mine.  One thing I dont tolerate well (other than lack of intelligence) is rudeness. Even said, trying to be funny, weight is not something you joke about to a woman. Especially a woman that has hormone problems.  I dunno, small issue, but has a big effect on me. I know some are thinking.. Jae.. you have self esteem issues, and I do, to an extent, because I'll never think i'm good enough.. (and damn I know I'm fat) but, do I need my future husband, telling me what to eat, or what not to, and how I should lose weight. I KNOW how to lose weight, i've done it before. But when its a challenge to not sleep your day away cuz you have nothing to look forward to, how do you get the motivation to work out an hour a day? and to eat healthy. Food is the only thing really enjoyable.    Haven't played my game in weeks, don't talk to many people online. When I am online, I don't really enjoy it, cuz if i'm not multitasking, I get bored easily.  And since I have dial up, I can't really do shit on my computer. The one things I enjoy lately are my two new friends, R. who chats with me on MSN (almost daily), and M. a friend of a friend, that emails me every day. Those are the two things I look forward to.   I want so much more. Not monetary.. or whatnot.. I just.. strive for more than this exsistance people call life. I wish I could understand my issues with God. I wish I could get over the fact that most people in my family don't love me or care, and that they will never change, no matter how much I pray that they could just love me and show me affection.   Its a sad life. A life without hope is hardly an existence. Life without hope is hell to me. Today I am partially glad I do have generalize anxiety disorder. I get scared going to new places by myself. Which prevents me from going to the gun shop and gettting a gun. Something any normal person, and even me could do, if I didn't have anxiety. So.. lately I've been thinking of asking (and hope to tommorrow) the Dr for some meds for my anxiety. I hate pills so I wonder deep down inside, that I think something will help, so I can take that trip to the gun shop. And that scares me. Without my anxiety, I'd be dead already.

Which is a major problem…they have no idea which individual has the best package to deliver.        That’s why there is an interview to choose that one person. Who is the person that gets the job? The individual who show the most “Proof” that they can get the job done.  What shows “Proof” to the highest degree during a job search? Without hesitation it’s a well organized career portfolio.        Employer Moto: You can have the skill and have plenty of experience, but you still have to prove that you’re worthy of the job.    2.) Are you waiting for a Promotion?       A popular question in the job industry is how can I get a promotion or how can I get promoted faster? Here is the simple reply to that question…      Create a Career Portfolio that exemplifies your skills, experience, and most important accomplishments. Let me ask you a question: Why should you get promoted if you can’t at least “show” what you have accomplished?      Your reply to this question may be “they should already know since I’ve been working there for so long.” This is not the case. The bottom line is this… companies don’t record what you have accomplished. They just evaluate whether you’re doing the job or not.       Your accomplishments probably go way beyond what you have done for the company. And guess what…your company or association definitely doesn’t know about that. So always keep a record of everything that can be tied to your profession.   3.) Are you in need of a raise in salary?      Who wouldn’t love to receive a raise? The real question that you need to answer is “Why should you receive a raise in salary? One of the hardest aspects of a career is getting that raise.       The more value you bring to a company or association, the more you get paid. You can have the skills and experience, but that still doesn’t answer the question: Why should I give you a raise?      Here is the solution to getting a raise. You have to prove to the company that you can provide more revenue or value then a normal individual. Just to give you one quick tip on how to distinguish your value from others… create a career portfolio and within that portfolio compare your skills to other people who work in your industry.       That way you eliminate the work for the employer. Now they don’t have to figure out whether you’re worth a raise because you have already showed them proof of why you’re worth more than the average person. Remember, it all starts with providing the company with more revenue or value…that is the key.   ======================================================== David Green is an author and hiring manager of Distinguish  Marketing, LLC.

2229,Cancer,"             you have chicken pot pie for breakfast.  So, yeah, not the greatest day.  I am a comfort eater.  If I am stressed out, depressed, or even happy I eat.  Why can't I be one of those people whose appetite is killed by that kind of stuff???  The rest of the day went as follows:  potato wedges, macaroni & cheese, and a new m-azing candy bar.  And a C2.  Which I love.  I normally can't drink diet sodas.  And while it's true that this one isn't technically diet, it's better than the real thing.  All in all, I suppose what I had today wasn't bad.  It isn't generally WHAT I eat, as HOW MUCH OF IT I eat.  Most times, all that I ate today would have been in ONE sitting.  Add a few more meals like that a day and that's where the weight came back on.  I refuse to get stressed out over it in a big way, because I know that will just set me up for more failure.  I'll be glad this weekend when all of this stuff is out of the house.  When I do my big grocery shopping, I'm not even going to buy junk.  If I don't bring it in, I won't eat it.  Simple as that.

2238,Pisces,"        - mysteries of blogging - see cushman starve – please forgive! -    One of the most interesting dimensions of blogging, dear audience, is that *  urlLink you  * may very well not exist.    I may devote earnest efforts to conjure you (emails, subtle references to blogcontentn in F2F conversation)...  But – in the end – you may or may not exist (/read).  Who knows?   COMBINE this mystery of blogging with another delightful one –   The relative invisibility of existing bloggers.  Try to find this blog with a search engine.  I dare you.  I don’t think you can do it.  Well actually as long as you use the EXACT NAME of the blog -- you can do it, but you only know the name because you've been here.  Just try to find the blog without that specialized knowledge...pretty hard, eh?  * but * even once you “find” “me” – JUST by reading you * still * can’t “reach me.”  Try to find (I dare you) a way to respond to me on this page.   Hunh?  Can’t do it! Its crazy!  If I actually PAID blogspot for this space – there would be a space for comments – but I’m cheap, and (frankly) a little afraid of my ability to stay “true” to blogging…so for now i'm a freeloader...  So the truth is that not only are many blogs unfindable / invisible, but they are also unrespondable – rendering them doubly invisible.  WHICH BRINGS ME – to my point....  I found my friend  urlLink Joel’s blog  a couple of weeks ago, and have enjoyed watching him trek through Europe…hearing his refreshing, hilarious, passionate voice again….BUT…  Even though I’ve found him.  I can’t * reach * him.  He doesn’t know that I’m listening.  That I exist (in cyberspace at least)  So my idea was -- I'll put it up as a contest on my blog -- first person to send me Joel's email address wins.  Since everyone's connected by six degrees of separation anyway -- it shouldn't be too hard.  BUT as if this were a fox-network-blog – there's a twist.  Here’s the latest entry from “cushman”:    Tuesday, July 29, 2003  Quite possibly the most amazing two days I've had. Amazing in the sense of me going completely homeless core. Jenkins and I went homeless all night in Milan waiting to catch our flight. Today has consisted of me in downtown Brussels constantly looking for a bed down in city parks; also trying to conserve my last euro coins; At one point I actually thought about going begging; Tonight I'm stranded by Marcus and am hoping to bed down in the Brussels airport; possibly the most hard core I've gone in awhile; Despite me being almost out of euros; I'm digging on this experience.  - posted by Joel @ 12:00 PM   Making up hipster language like 'homeless core' is just like Joel!   And for him (unlike if I tried to do it), it works!  But despite his ability to use language well, apparently, he's disappearing into poverty in Europe somewhere.  Possibly Brussels.  Running out of Euros to eat (but still blogging -- that's heroism -- a sense of the tragic frame!  if you must die in poverty, make sure you do it with an audience (see _Rent_)).    Who knows what’s happened to Joel since?  My little contest * could * be a very short - lived reality – show – style - blog - quest.    If we don’t find him soon – we may very well -- in hyperreal time – See Cushman Starve.  Of course, if I were a normal guy and this were a normal blog the whole thing would have said, “Hey! Anybody know my friend Joel Larson from BG?  Do you read his cushman blog?  Do you have his email address?”  But that’d be way too easy.    Besides this way – maybe I'll come up with prizes...   urlLink Happy International Forgiveness Day!     Be sure to keep forgiving everybody that you need to…it’s the hardest work we can do as humans.  As my Newcastle Ale cap read the other day:  “life’s too short to be bitter.”  (in terms of beer, I disagree, but in terms of forgiveness – Amen!)  Peace & Forgiveness ~      "

2244,Aries,"           Let's get the record straight about the 2000 Election.  After each recount Bush still won in Florida.  I believe there were 3 recounts: a machine recount, and 2 hand recounts.  At the conclusion of each one, the Gore team (not Bush) cried foul and appealed to the higher courts.  It was the Gore team that tried and succeded in a lot of cases to have military absentee votes invalidated because of technicalities.  And they cheered when the decision by the court was returned in their favor!  Can you believe that?!  A candidate who consistently said he wanted 'to be sure that each vote was counted' had his attourneys in court cheering when they discredited the validity of the votes of men and women serving their country!  What a 'man' Gore is!     Next, there  is  federal election law provided in the Constitution.  The Constitution provides the boundaries for electing the President by the electors of the Electoral College.  Check out this web site for more info:   http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/refarticle.aspx?refid=761576768               'The electoral system was devised by the drafters of the Constitution of the United States, who hoped thereby to entrust the responsibility to people whose choice would be unaffected by partisan politics. In Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, the method of selecting electors is delegated to the separate state legislatures, and the voting procedure to be followed by the electors is carefully defined. According to the electoral procedure originally specified in the Constitution, the electors were to vote for the two most qualified persons without specifying which was preferred for president and which for vice president. The candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes, provided the votes of a majority of the electors were received, would be president, and the candidate winning the second largest number of votes would be vice president. A serious flaw in this procedure was revealed in the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was the presidential candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party (the forerunner of todays Democratic Party) and Aaron Burr was the candidate for vice president. The electors, by voting strictly for candidates of their party, gave Burr and Jefferson the same number of votes. As the Constitution provided, the election was referred to the House of Representatives, where a protracted struggle took place, requiring 36 ballots before Jefferson was chosen president and Burr vice president. Therefore, in 1804 Congress enacted and the states ratified the 12th Amendment, providing for separate electoral votes for president and for vice president.'   As you see in the article, the selecting of electors is left to the states' legislatures, but the election of a President is outlined in the Constitution.  Ben, the author of your article didn't do his homework.  The election of Bush to office according to the Constitution is fully legit.  Sorry, Democrats!   As far as the Toricelli case, Representatives and Senators are elected according to individual laws of the states.  So I can understand why the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.         "
2245,Gemini,"                 I got confirmed today.  The chrism smells funky.  I went to church twice because of it.  No real complants, nothing much was going on today.  23rd Knight play again today, at 11 am.  I missed it because confirmation also started at 11.  I figured since there was a kind of 'Battle of the Bands' that my friends that went to see 23rd Knight would have stayed for the whole thing.  So, I made the trip to Loretto, around 2 pm to see who all was there.  It was a Open House at St. Francis, the 'Battle of the Bands' was more of a side show.  I think when I got there, there was about 10 people actually watching the band play.  Another wasted trip.  I did find out that my Blazer will do about 80 in the time that my cousin's Accord will do 100.  I   Finally  got to watch the Matrix:Revolutions.  Good movie.  Fight scenes that will blow your mind.  If you've watched the first two a must see.  I do realize am pretty late on my review, but do you realize I watched it for the first time tonite?

2256,Pisces,"       ...................................................................................  sparkling clean septic systems and airline culture  ...................................................................................  6:37 a.m. -- i hear addison coughing upstairs, its a bit of a gagging cough and i'm a pretty over-protective parent when it comes to sickness...  i arrive to find him throwing up on every piece of bed linen, pjs, pacifier, you name it.   i rush him to the toilet so he can hold his head in it (which he clearly enjoys) and not throw up anymore.   i briefly remember the scene from trainspotting.  i think about how much more alluring, clean and sparkly our bathroom, toilet, and possibly even septic system is than that one was.    I wipe him clean, make him a sicky bed on the couch downstairs.  (one of my favorite memories from being childhood was sickbeds on the sofas.)  (parenthetically to that parenthetically, one of my favorite traits about my grandma linda was that she always refered to couches as 'sofas' or 'davenports' -- never couches.  i subsequently always presumed that the word: couch was a bit lowbrow.  my grandma linda was a pretty class act.  more on that later.)  9:00 a.m. -- the babysitting coop is scheduled to arrive -- no word yet on whether sickness will postpone their arrival.   11:30 a.m. -- jaelyn's preschool is having a thanksgiving feast for which she volunteered us to bring hotdogs.  every four year old got to volunteer their specialty food.  so the menu includes popcorn, hotdogs, white cake & (i pity the four year old's parents who volunteered on this one --) turkey.  3 p.m. -- i leave for 5 days in miami.   that's right i'm leaving my wife with a sick two year old and a precocious 4 year old for five days.   i don't feel good about that.  but i do relish the chance to be in liminal spaces all days -- airports / airplanes -- alone.    finding space to be alone is so difficult during this season of life...there's something so freeing in the massness, the globalizingness, the strangerhood of airline travel...its a world (at least here in the 'developed' world) that is so antiseptic...  i don't embrace those values, but i have to admit that they provide me a place for solace.   peace~    "

2258,Capricorn,"           ack! cursed blogger erased my rather lengthy post.  now i have to write it all over, and it will never be as good as it was.  here we go anyway.  today was another day consumed by golf.  i played 18 holes this morning, where i shot 83 and played fairly well, and then i had a lesson this evening which also went well.  i also finished a book called 'mafia cop'.  its about some guy who grew up with his family in the mafia, but he became a cop.  for someone like me who is fascinated by organized crime, it was an interesting book.  it wasnt incredibly well-written or organized, but there was a lot of 'good stuff' as i like to call it in there.  its by bob drury and louie eppolito (can you guess which one was the mafia guy?) if you want to check it out.  next on my list, unfortunately, is a book for school called 'rebecca'.  it looks like some sort of romance novel, which is not really my cup o tea.  i guess i will just have to suck it up and read it...not sure why it was assigned. saw spiderman 2 last night with some people from school and youth group.  it was pretty good, it had more depth than what i expected.  a little corny, and some graphics (web swinging from building stuff) were kind of weak, but overall i would give it 3.5 out of 4 stars (yes movies are out of 4 stars, not 5 like a lot of my friends think...its not a restaurant or a hotel!  very annoying...yes i am easily annoyed, sorry.  it makes me more interesting as a person...maybe...) tomorrow i am going down to red white and boom ('largest fireworks display in the midwest') with cody.  i have actually never been before.  i know there will be a squidgetload of people down there.  i am predicting i will get mugged.  who knows.  i will carry minimal cash.  thats about all ive got for now. ps: the post title is the name of an article i read somewhere.  its by a harvard professor, so its obviously not conservatively biased.  its an interesting objective view.  im not taking sides on this,  urlLink but here is a link if you want to read it.   have a great friday :) and be safe this holiday weekend as an excessive amount of coppage is expected to be present (aka the po-po).  there you have it, i can use ebonics as well as the next guy.  there, now i am really done.

2259,Virgo,       there is a place not far from here where the only walls are the ones within people where new beginnings take place and old friends are seen where the sound of laughing children echoes all around a place where strangers smile when you walk by and even if they are paid to be nice you don't care because it just feels good to be around  happy people the air is cleaner you come home so tired yet refreshed as if god himself breathed new life into you you are free to be exactly who you are you don't have to expose your weaknesses but you are free to if you so desire you walk around and notice that this place is so inviting the butterflies seem to dance as they travel from each flower as if they know that this place is the only place they want to be the stars at night seem to shout your name bringing a sense of calm to your soul the moon in its brilliance beckons you to savor each second that you spend in this piece of heaven when you leave all you want to do is run back to the safety of innocence to the calling of truth to the friendly people who greet you with smiles on their faces and love in their hearts but that is not your reality for one week of the year you make the trek the rest of the time you are stuck here in oblivion away from that one place you'd rather be

2262,Cancer,"       Four day countdown to the superstorm 2003 date, my companion memphians. If fate and omens play any part in this, we shall observe a second land-blown hurricane descend about our mortal ears. A tornado will peel the bark off trees and panes from windows. After such, hail shall rain with such intensity as to render roofs and walls useless, and straightline winds will sweep away the debris, the trees, and everything not duct taped down. Lightning shall light the streets with unnatural fire. And then everyone shall crawl out, those who are still alive.  If fate and omens have nothing to do with it, July 22 will pass just as quietly as it would have a year ago had the storm not occurred. Wait. That seems a bit pointless to say. Oh well.  Got AP scores back today. I took biology (and lab) as well as english language and composition.

2263,Sagittarius,"       Today I did a little research on what makes a relationship tick....  1.  Trust : Without this there is nothing called a relation between two people. Trust emcompasses 'us'.  2.  Belief : This is not blind belief but a belief which comes out of understanding the person to the extent that there should not be a reason for the other partner to even wonder if there is an underlying meaning to something and takes things at face value.  3.  Ego : If there is an ego in any relationship between two people, only one thing can be a sure thing in this....the relationship is heading straight down the drain.  In a relationship, the mere thought of an ego cannot exist and one needs to bare their soul to the other person.  One can never think in terms of 'I', every thought has to be 'us' or 'we'!  4.  Boundaries : Boundaries fix the end point of your relationship.  Love is boundless, so by putting a boundary for the same or a timeline, one would be curtailing their feelings and allowing time to take a precedence over love.  5.  Past : Past plays a very important role in any relationship.  One needs to make peace with their past before moving to any other relationship.  Without accepting one's past, one always carries the baggage forward and messed the forthcoming relationships.  Then comes the comparision factor, which wrecks any relationship.  Each case is as unique as a finger print.  Comparision will only bring to light the strains of the past.  6.  Time out/ Breaks : This can be a plus as well as a minus in a relationship.  Minus in the sense that people make misuse this time to check out other options and then take a call on the current relationship.  This in reality does not help, but infact confuses the situation and adds a new dimension to ones' already confused mind and soul!  The plus of taking a break/ break, allows one to take a step back and understand the beauty of the relationship.  One never understands the beauty of a relationship while in it, its only when one takes a step back/ out and looks at things from an outsider perspective does one feel ready to accept the pitfalls and the compromises both partners have made towards the relationship.  7.  Coaching : As strange as it may sound, coaching is an essential part of a relationship.  Without the process of continous learning in the relationship, the excitement in the relationship is lost and what one has is just two people trying to cling onto each other because they are not prepared to let go and give each other space to understand themselves and their partner.  Coaching becomes extremely important in a relationship especially when the relationship is moving through a period of turbulence.  It is in period of turbulence that one should not take a decision to step away from the situation, but instead try to guide the other person to the shores close by.  This process of marooning a person in the time of need, infact turns out to be the first steps of moving away from the partner. The relationship needs to be given the time and space to grow, after all its' like a baby which needs to sit up, then have a steady head, then turn over, then crawl, stand, walk, etc.  Each step has an unique joy and moving thro' each level is what brings the two people together.  8.  Anger & Aggression : When one is trying to work towards building a relationship, being aggressive and trying to force an issue will never help.  There is a saying, 'time and tide waits for none', exactly on those lines, when one tries to shift gears in a relationship before it is ready to move to the next level, the relationship heads no where, and infact move down a gear in reality.  Controlled aggression is the way to building a relationship.  Anger will never help in exhausting the pain, its only sweet words or atleast words said in a diplomatic manner which will help.  A person blinded by anger never gets to understand the true meaning of ones' thoughts, and as result never conveys the meaning which is actually intended.  As a result, all the good thoughts and intentions, goes down the drain!  9.  Commitment & Consistency : This is an important key to unlock the box of happiness in any relationship.  Once this is broken, there is not a locksmith in the world which can find a key to match that particular lock.  Unflinching commitment, even in the worst of the circumstances is what gives belief to one's partner and more than anything makes one's partner actually show more love and affection towards them.  One has to stay consistent in a relationship.  In a relationship between two people where there is no blood relationship, its the words and actions which bind the two people together.   Words and actions once executed will always leave their scars on a relationship, atleast in the subconscious mind.  10.  Respect : The most important aspect of any relationship is the respect which the concerned have for each other.  Respect governs the heart and soul. Respect is the corner stone, once lost, takes a very long time to be earned!  I personally believe that relationship between two people who are not connected by a blood relationship is always a fragile one.  Without a good understanding of ones' partner on a deeper and not superficial level, the relationship has no binding at all.    Any building needs a strong foundation......no use of having the strongest pillars, best of the concrete, best of the architectural designs.......reinforcements will never help!           "
2264,Sagittarius,       We're moving a week from today... here's a few more pictures of the progress that's been made.    urlLink

2266,Aquarius,"       For the last two weeks I have really been looking forward to this weekend because there is a dodgeball tournament at a high school near my house.  Dodgeball is my favorite sport and I was brimming with anticipation over assembling and leading a team of friends into such a glorious competition.  As I was ironing out the details I clicked on the waiver because I had to read it.  No one over 18.  I am 18 in less than a month.  Their unequitable line in the sand crushed my soul, telling me I am not worthy to play in their league. I'll tell you what.  They will rue the day they excluded me.  I will train harder than anyone has ever trained for anything.  I will make Rocky's training in Siberia in Rocky IV seem like a walk in the park.  And next year, when they come back to Portland from their pansy headquarters in Los Angeles, I will tear the Beaver Ball trophy from their well moistuized hands and my triumph will be sung throughout the ages by all people of all walks of life who need the inspiration of heroes to continue their own heroic existence.         "
2267,Capricorn,"       Everyday is a good day indeed. Yet, in my case at least, everyday is just like the day before, with the same routine. However, after almost drowning myself with self-pity on that fine Thursday as I was stuck in the house without anyone with my intellectual capacity to talk to, the phone rang. I dashed, with anticipation, hoping someone would save me by adding some spice to that fateful Thursday. Sure enough, I heard a familiar sound from the other side of connection. My saviour happened to be my old schoolmate back in secondary school. She goes by the name “Kamala”. Little wonder to why I found such joy for finally being able to fill up my Thursday evening with such a company for she is known as “ALAMAK” (Kamala becomes Alamak if it is read out the other way round!).  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Alamak” is probably the best word to describe how I felt just under 5 minutes of conversing with her. First, I forgot that her birthday had just passed. After receiving a nice sounding for it, we resumed our conversation in which she gave me another blow. She told me that the coming weekend, she was going for a ‘medical camp’ where she would be a volunteer. After hearing the ring word ‘medical’ I gave her volleys of questions. I had always wanted to be a doctor since I was a kid that spent most of her television time watching the TV-series “ER” or emergency room. Of course it is hardly a reason enough for me to commit me life to the profession that is associated with sweating blood and slaving for at least a decade before becoming a ‘specialist’. Imagine the look on the faces of the admission officers for university when they hear my reason.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To cut a long and winding conversation short, I agreed to come with her to volunteer my services to the society. I had been looking furiously for the past few months for a concrete reason as to why I want to be a physician. Medicine is a field where there has to be passion for what you are doing. And that is precisely what I am looking for. By searching myself now, I would not be making any wrong turns in life by entering this field blindly only to discover later that medicine is not for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subsequent days left me in fits of anticipation. Would I like it? Is it going to be under the hot sun? I knew a few things though. This medical camp was organized by the Pusat Satya Sai Malaysia. They are a religious organization that does voluntary services. This medical camp is conducted for the villagers of Kampung Sungai Kayu Ara. The irony here is, this ‘village’ is actually situated in the city itself. Moreover, it is so near KDU. The residents of this village are mainly Indians. That is about the only information Kamala could give me and I was suppose to be contented with that. I did ask her what kind of volunteering we were going to do and she told me that there would be the ‘eye-chart test’, measurement of height and weight and also ‘urine test’. She added that I should not be in such high hopes because as a volunteer, we could be asked to pick up rubbish or control the crowd. Being more of a technical kind of person, I hoped that I would not be doing something I do everyday. I want some experience in the medical field to add colours and dimensions to my personal statement when application for places in university comes along.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That day finally came. On the 3rd July, I woke up in the morning, took my breakfast and with a deep breath left home and hitched a ride with dear Kamala to go to “Charity Medical and Health Camp”. When we got there, it looked more like a political rally camp than a medical camp. There were banners and there was a continuous stream of people walking towards that area. That ‘area’ turned out to be a Tamil school after all. It is sad because its condition was bad, nearly dilapidating under the watchful eyes of the city. I did not even manage to get the schools name. Kamala then spotted a fellow volunteer and asked her where we were suppose to meet-up and finalize matters. We then moved in the direction shown by her, to find ourselves in a room. There we met the other volunteers, which included Saras, Supriya, Dhanya, Michael (a white guy who unfortunately was not good-looking) Raj, Kala, and Pravin. Subsequently we were given identification tags and divided into groups by Dr. Wong. Kamala, Michael, Raj and I was in-change of the ‘eye-chart test’, while Supriya, Kala, Saras and Dhanya were told to measured the height, weight and BMI (ratio of the weight to the height of a person). Then, we were shown in a room where the booths were set up for us to carry out our respective tasks.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This room is where I spent my entire day of this camp. My booth was in the middle, separating Dhanya’s booth and the “blood-sugar level test”. Dr. Wong then gave us instructions on how to conduct the eye test. First, patients would stand behind a line&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (approximately 2 meters from the charts) on the floor marked by tape. We would then close one side of the patients’ eye to test its acuity. The patient would then be asked to name the alphabets In the report papers carried along by the patient, we would write the smallest font size the patient can read based on the chart. The font sizes were from the biggest to the smallest: 60, 36, 24, 18,9,7.5,6,and 4. Eye acuity of 60-9 would be categorized as “red”. Within this group, those with eye acuity of 24 and above would be sent to see the ophthalmologists next door for further medical evaluation while those below 24 to 9 should consider wearing spectacles. On the other hand, font size below 9&nbsp; would be termed “blue” (more like an no-need-to-worry sign). In the report papers, we must write the results by ratio, which was 6 per the font size patients could see (ex. 6/36). According to Dr. Wong, this test would enable us to spot those people who actually never come to realize that they are partially blind. Some of the older patients would also come with cataracts and myopia.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By that time, residents of Kampung Kayu Ara were streaming in steadily, wanting to take this once in a lifetime chance to get their medical check-up. An elderly man, aged 103 came on wheel chairs. This shows that they took this medical camp seriously. My job was to write out the results on the report papers carried by the patient, Michael in controlling the traffic, Raj and Kamala got to play the models on “Wheel of Fortune” by doing the alphabet pointing. Now, it took me a while to get warmed-up to the task of getting it right. However, I managed to memorize the reactions on the patients face when they could not see anymore and jot down the font size without being told by Raj what the results was. I realized that this test was well adapted to suit all kinds of patients. For those who were illiterate, symbols was used. The patients would use a card to turn in order to show us the shape pointed on the chart (the letter E laid in different angles).   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The height and weight measurements were carried out in this manner. Patients would come in to have their weight and height measured. The numbers was than recorded in the report papers. Once this was completed, a scale was used to see if their weight was proportional to their height. This scale made the work easier as in actual fact the BMI can be counted by this formula: weight per unit square height (weight in kilograms and height in metre). If this scale showed a number larger than 24, the patient would than be considered to be overweight and obese if the number was larger than 27.   As time passed, call me naïve, but I was certainly shocked when many requested for the symbol card. It was a hard blow because most of them were middle-aged women. This clearly shows that there is still the prevalent attitude among the Indians that women are useless if not for being a good wife, a loving mother, and a productive baby-making machine. Then again, I must not forget to say that some men could not read too, noticeably among the elderly ones. The kids were joyous bunch to work with. Some were so shy to even tell us what they see. They keep glancing at their mothers. On the other hand, some found it as an opportunity to showcase their intelligence. They practically shouted the alphabets to us and we appreciable gave them the “bagus” hand-sign.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the more medical side of my evaluation, I noticed that these villagers had a serious eyesight problem. Many were given the “red” label. There was a case where this teenage girl, who was wearing glasses, recorded a result of 6/36 on both eyes. This shows how badly in need these people are. Her parents probably could not help her because of their financial constrains. I can safely say that 90% of them needed spectacles to see clearly. Far more saddening was fact that this group included a large number of school-going kids. I also learned that those who were considered overweight or obese had a high chance of having bad eyesight. Of course this would be then a clear indication the patient suffers from diabetes. When we were conducting the eye-test, we were told by Dr. Wong to refer those who were above 40 years of age to the ‘blood-sugar level test’ booth. We were also to keep our eyes open to those who were overweight to refer them to this booth. Patients who did not belong to either of this group would then be cleared for the subsequent check-up, which was physical check as I was told.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving on, I cannot avoid saying that I suffered the most violent slap on the face that day, metaphorically that is. Although I am an Indian, I do not know to converse in my mother tongue, but I do understand it. Every time I try, I sound very odd. That is precisely how I sounded that day. I had to direct the patients to the next destination once the eye-check up was completed. As most of them were Indians, they all expected me to converse with them in Tamil. I suffered needless to say. The worst was yet to unfold until I had to explain to an elderly illiterate lady how the symbol card mechanism worked in the most retarded Tamil sentences ever spoken. I managed to pull off some words and I am proud to say that by the end of the day, the most frequent sentence structure I had to use was mastered quite well. Prior to this, I have never been ashamed of my disability but now, I sincerely regret that I never bothered to master this intricate language that requires such complex and multidimensional tongue movement.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, after all the hard work, the volunteers were allowed to go for our first break on a rotational basis after nearly 6 hours of non-stop work since 8.30 a.m. There was specially prepared food waiting for us. The food was vegetarian, since The Satya Sai is in fact a religious movement. I heard the food of excellent. I decided to skip it by downing some sponge cake to take a look around at the other booths available in the camp. I spotted a dentist room, pharmacy, and a common area. I also heard that they were conducting pap-smear test and breast examination for the ladies. How wonderful I thought to myself as I walked back to me room. It was then that I decided to infiltrate into the “blood-sugar level test”.&nbsp; As I said, I wanted some technical experience and I was sure going to go and look for it. As the volunteers manning the booth had left, I decided to help out.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First thing first, I was brief by a fellow volunteer how to conduct the test. The steps are : 1) dab some ethanol on the tip of the patients finger with clumps of wool &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) insert the lancet in rectangular shaped injector &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) place the tip of the open injector on the tip of the patients’ finger &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) press the button which would release the lancet for penetration of epidermis &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; layer of the patients’ finger &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) once pricked, finger then pressed to facilitate blood flow to produce a larger  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drop &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) blood glucose test strip inserted in glucometer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7) drop of blood dripped on the strip  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8) wait for the reading on the glucometer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9) offer the patient some wool to cover the prick Of course there were a few precautions that had to be taken to ensure the safety and the validity of the results. I must remember to change the lancet in the injector and the blood test strip each time. I find that the injector helps a lot especially for those with injection related phobia. They would be spared the trauma, as the insertion of the lancet on their finger cannot be seen. This test would yield a better result if the patient had fasted before the test was conducted. Only then would the sugar level in the bloodnot fluctuate as when it does right after a meal. For a person who had fasted, the normal sugar level in the blood ranges from 3.0-6.0, measured in mmol/l (milli moles per liter). In lay mans’ term, this would mean the concentration of sugar in the blood.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what did I discover? Many things actually. Although it took me some time to get used to the idea of pricking people, but I was thoroughly enjoying it. It was quite hard to get a nice drop of blood from some patients as they either had to little or watery blood. Some of the men had such rough skin, I had to injected a few times to get a puncture. I presumed that these men were labourers. If once was not enough, I had to face another slap. I could not explain to the patients their results other than delivering the reading on the glucometer to them. I had difficulty applying my classroom knowledge in the real world. I had to keep on referring them to a rather nice lady volunteer who assured or chided them gently, depending on the results on the meter.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All good things have to come to an end. And so, my day as a medical camp volunteer ended with me being a more knowledgeable person. I went home at around 3.00 p.m. By that time, the common area was almost empty. I could safely say that at least a thousand people turned up that day and this camp was certainly a success. It proved that although impoverished, these people had a clear understanding on the importance of being healthy. They took up the opportunity to evaluate their health level. At least now I know efforts like this actually help those in need.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most importantly, this experience gave me a clearer picture of myself. At least I know now that I do in fact enjoy helping people. That is a step closer to being a passionate medical practitioner. Furthermore, I realized how foolishly disillusioned I was in assuming that it was a disgrace to speak my own mother tongue. Nothing beats the joy of knowing more about your very own roots and culture. I had blindly dismissed any attempts to cultivate a clear understanding in the Tamil language. Now, I have to pay the price.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the brighter side, I had a chance to meet and see things and sceneries previously hiding in the blind spot of my eyes. As a human being, I just got too comfortable with my surroundings that I never thought of displacing myself.

For some reason, it bothers me to have people assume things about me, even if their assumptions are correct.  Because I hate it when I might  actually  make a mistake, and everyone freaks out.  Sometimes I think I just want to stand up and scream, 'FUCK YOU!'  just to see what would happen.  I think the whole world would die of shock. And I know how flawed I really am.

2273,Virgo,"       Wow, this is sooo much fun.  1st day - My aunt picks me up from the airport and we dont do anything special that day except relax.  2nd day - We spend the whole day watching movies on pay-per-view and tv. Just more relaxing.  3rd day - Total mystery to me and my sister...my Aunt wont tell me where we are going. She wakes us up at 6am to get ready, and we are outta the house by 7am. Then we drive for 4 hours to 'hearst castle'. Its some castle type thingy that this really rich guy built, now its a historical landmark or something. After going on the tour of the castle, we went to our hotel and i swam in the pool with my sister for like 5 hours.  4th day - Another long drive. Again my aunt wont tell us where we are going. It was supposed to be a 2 hour drive but there was a lot of people that drove really really slow and we couldn't pass them so it was more like 3 hours. We finally got to our hotel...called the Econo-Lodge...wow, that sounds classy. We then drove for like 15 mins to a place called 'mystery spot' where anything round rolls uphill, and you can walk up walls and stuff...im gonna have my aunt get her pics on a CD so i can post some here. Then we drive back to our hotel and i swim with my sister again, only for 3 hours this time.  5th day - Did i mention that we were in Sana Cruz? Haha. Beach! Santa Cruz Boardwalk, that was fun. A few good rides, foood, girls...haha. And the beach...that was cool, except i have sand all over me because theres so much sand in the water...and because i got buried. Haha, that was fun. Now for the drive back to my Aunts house. It should have been like an hour drive, but my uncle got lost for a few mins, then there was a wreck somehwhere, and that made a lot of traffic. Finally 2 hours later we get back to my Aunt's house. I watch a lil tv then crash at about midnight.  6th day - Today my Aunt had to go to a friends sisters funeral. I get to stay at her house and just eat ice cream all day and watch more tv. Nothin special.  7th day - Today was the last day... :( . We went to a place called Boomers...they have go karts, batting cages, mini golf, arcade, that type of stuff. It was fun. I hate the words 'i dunno' right now. You will be shot if u say that more than 2 times in a day to me. :-) Unless ur name is Jordan then you can say it all u want.  8th day - I flew back home...and we got Krsipy Creme donuts...it was awesome! But when we were boarding, the dude takin the ticket things asked how old me and my sister were...i said 14, and my sis said 12. Then the guy is like she has to be 13 to fly unless there is someone 18 years old with her. WTF! My Aunt had to pay 30$ so this lady that worked for the airport and was going to seattle anyway could walk my sis on and off the plane...it was so fucked up....it never happened any other time i've taken a cousin or sibling along that was under 13. Stupid airport.          "

Physically, its taxing but sculpturous, wat else, in my kind of work, i get to interect with the public, am able to understand the needs of the local population in a bird's eye view. wat else, NS foster friendship to a larger circle of cliques, could be good, or bad cliques, that depends on how one chooses friends. Erm, there's a bad thing abt NS, kind of waste one's time, especially in terms of education. a two to three years gap of being in another line kind of makes one loses focus. Honestly in country like singapore whereby everything well, almost is spoon fed, NS kind of counter the silverspoon legacy,  overall, NS is a good thing, but its up to individual to take advantage of it or perished with the negative influence.

She was funny too.  'Is someone smoking pot in here?'  'Did you know that giraffes communicate with each other into ultra-low sonic frequencies? I just saw that on the Discovery Channel. Yeah, 'coz I thought for the last song there where it goes  (sings a low tune) , the giraffes could have done it well.'   The band playing with her were pretty quirky and easy-going too, peppering the performance with comments and laughter. The group was fun to watch, and great to listen to - there was chemistry, and they seemed so relaxed and happy to be on stage, and were so totally devoid of the performance anxiety that grips most background musicians, who generally intensely focus on their playing and ignore the interaction-with-the-audience bit.  After the last song of the set (which was her hit single, Sway, from her debut album 'Drive'), she mimed to the audience that this was the last song, she was going off stage, we were supposed to clap, yell encore, and then she would come out again - hehe, acknowledging the farce that are 'last song' performances, 'coz there's ALWAYS an encore.  Confession: I teared when she sang 'Drive' as part of her encore performance, 'coz, I dunno, it sounded so melancholic, and it reminded me of my sis and how she'd describe the drive-arounds she'd have with Ken, and then I thought of my sis and how I missed her, and I dunno, the whole general atmosphere I suppose.

2288,Sagittarius,"        Three to fall down  3 1/2 actually.  I have decided to get Leia a helmet.  I believe that's the only way I'm going to preserve her tender little melon (her head) from serious damage.  She is constantly falling down, and its always on her head and/or face.  Its not because she's clumsy like her mother; she doesn't trip over her own feet or walk into walls.  Ok, sometimes she walks into walls, but that's another day's topic.  She bounces, she jumps... she FLIES.  She jumps on my bed, the sofa, the chair.  And sooner or later she lands on her head.  And she hasn't yet learned that jumping leads to falling.  Last night was a perfect example.    I didn't even see her standing on our particulary bouncy chaise lounge.  She must have done what she always does -- start at the head of the chair, bounce along the length of the lounge and then dive off the end of it onto a huge cushion on the floor.  It scares the hell out of me everytime I see it, but this time I didn't see it.  And this time she missed the cushion, flew right past it head first into the wall and the base of a tall wrought-iron candle holder.    When I find her, she's lying face down, like a little doll shoved into the corner with her head pushed too far to the left.  Miraculously, she was fine.  A little scared, no real damage done.  And then, once the boo-boo was all gone and she had calmed down, we had discussed not jumping on that chair anymore.  She agrees by saying, 'Ok, Mommy.  Let's go jump on your bed better.'  *sigh*   Either I'm going to have a vegetable for a daughter or she's strong enough to live through a nuclear holocaust.  Headgear is the only way to be sure.

2290,Virgo,"           Josh Marshall made a  urlLink  post   to his blog last night that is very tempting to believe. He talks about the tone of the Democratic National Convention as being starkly different from the tone of the campaign amongst the candidates for the nomination.  Much has been said in the media about how the rhetoric of the DNC has been surprisingly light in terms of attacks on the Bush Administration, and Josh offers his explanation in two points:   First:   On the surface, the fiery rhetoric and animus of 2003 and early 2004 were directed at President Bush. And to some degree of course they were. But the punch of that rhetoric derived not so much from Democrats' antipathy for President Bush as from a pitched battle, almost a rebellion, within the Democratic party -- the grassroots of the Democratic party insisting that Washington Democrats were compromising with the president over particulars when he was leading the country in a direction that had to be opposed across the board. Fiery rhetoric against President Bush was fiery rhetoric against compromise and accommodation with him. In other words, it was to a very real degree aimed at other Democrats.    Second:   Anger is often, and rage is almost always, an emotion rooted in powerlessness. That was certainly the position of Democrats in early 2003 (on so many levels), though less so as the year went on. These Democrats don't feel powerless. The mood is one of cautious optimism that they can drive the president from office, that the wind is at their backs.   So, Josh thinks the change in tone is a sign of unity and optimism.  That certainly is a glass-half-full way to interpret it.  Yet, while I'd rather be optimistic, the polls showing Bush and Kerry in a dead heat, despite the glaring fact that the Bush Administration has dragged this country through the gutter, erode my ability to believe that the Democratic Party has what it takes to beat the Republicans.  What Josh sees as a new found confidence, I see as fearful, tip-toe dancing around the swing voters.    The point that anger is 'almost always' rooted in powerlessness, while likely true, rules out the potent combination of anger and confidence, righteous indignation, that occasionally surfaces during struggles for freedom and justice.  As a model, I look to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  MLK spoke the plain truth and there was no way to hide the legitimate anger he felt about racism.  He had utter confidence that he was right and deep faith that he would succeed.  I find it deeply ironic that the most successful movies in America are blockbuster action films with heroes who act out of righteous indignation.  It is a classic American icon, yet somewhere along the line the Democratic Party decided that this formula doesn't work.  Yes, the media jumped all over Howard Dean for his post-Iowa pep rally.  The key, however, was how the Dean campaign, and the Democrats in general, reacted.  Rather than defend the emotion that Dean was showing, which I contend was much more that of enthusiasm than anger, they apologized and toned it down.  This is classic pacification, and the worst part is that it is self-inflicted.           "

2292,Scorpio,"             Ok... Singapore just broadcasted 'World Idol' and I'm wondering why Asians could not vote. Racist people! Anyway only the first 6 people were shown, with the last 5 due next week. So here is my commentary for this week's show.  Ok when the German guy came out I was like 'What were you thinking? With that sleeveless shirt?' He is quite a good-looking guy though, but his song choice is really bad. Up-tempo songs don't usually go well with the public's taste, and he will not have an audience large enough to win. For his limited English, I would actually say that was good enough, just not enough to win.  The Aussie Idol had a great voice, but his flamboyant style really puts me off. What's worse, he picked a well known song, changed the arrangement totally and destroyed the song. He was like talking melodiously, creepy. For the Pan Arabic Idol, who am I to judge? But anyway all I can say is that I thought her to be very brave but maybe her target audience is not huge enough to win World Idol. Right from one of the judge's mouths, funny he was reading my thoughts...  The Dutch Idol is another super geek turned superstar. And I really like his sense of humour, banking on his geekiness to give him the cool look. And this is emphasised greatly on the spectacles! He was quite good, but not outstanding, and like I said before not outstanding, means not winner. I'm still wondering however, how he got through the second auditions when he forgot his words. I don't think American Idol would have allowed him to.  A law student with a big face. Sy whatever you want but his voice is really good. His performance however really pitchy. I don't know if he uses English frequently, but anyway not good enough to win. But anyway I don't think anyone was paying attention to his pitch problems because of his good looks.   The Polish Idol... Ok, first things first, BRACES? Oh my god, Simon is never going to use the phrase 'Too young for the competition' anymore. Well obviously she had a lot of pitch problems and an awkward sense of volume control, but like the German judge said, she has a big voice, and an even bigger personality. I love the personality and the dialogue between her and a few of the judges. I especially like the one where one of the judges said something about her being as bad as the Polish judge, and she had a look of pure horror on her face as she answered 'No, not him!'   Hahaha... That's all for today, I'll bring you more next week!         "

2296,Leo,"                 I took this 'Which Reality Show's Right for You' test on  urlLink tickle.com .  Here are my results:   American Idol   Stars aren't born they're created — just ask the Monkees. All you need is the big break and American Idol is it. Whether it was an impromptu serenade in the school cafeteria or the business presentation-turned-standup routine, you've always been a performer at heart.   Yeah, right!  The thought of performing anything (much less singing) on stage terrifies me.  It's strange though, in high school/middle school I loved being in front of a crowd.  Who knows what happened to that.  I dread going to school everyday because I hate the thought of a professor calling on me.  American Idol?  Come on.  The only singing I do is in the car, and even then I make sure the music is loud enough I don't have to hear myself.  :)  Check out that website--they've got some pretty funny tests.  I'll post another one later.  I've got to catch up on some sleep tonight.  We had our first big outing as a group last night--getting enough sleep was apparently not part of the agenda. We had a pretty damn good time.  Let's just say I was counting down the minutes in Crim Law today because I wasn't sure I was going to make it.  Hopefully I'll feel like a normal person again tomorrow.  Good night!               "

The first interview doesn't really get 'good' until the last paragraph, when he starts talking about the effect of the overtly Christian ethos prevalent in the book.  The most interesting point I found him talking about was his perception of the demographical change that's going to take place in Europe in the next 50-75 years.  Very interesting shit, and VERY insightful given todays idiotic batch of actors/entertainers.  However, that's another post for another day.

2306,Sagittarius,"       Lars and I just returned from a week of meetings in Toyko and Seoul.  We got the rare opportunity to look around a little in both places, and it worked out that we had an extra day in Korea for sightseeing.  In addition to visiting a shooting range, we took a tour of the Demilitarized Zone on the border of North and South Korea.  It was rather eye opening, since my only real reference to the Korean war is M*A*S*H... it was also a bit surreal and certainly put a new spin on the current situation in North Korea for me...     urlLink    The Bridge of Freedom in Korea         "
2307,Cancer,"           Ok I've never felt like so many people were talking about me in life. It's really funny how word spreads so fricken fast, seriously I told like two people and then ba-bam! Ya I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about..... I'm going out with Aaron..... Hi Aaron! Seeing that Lauren bluntly told me that I must write in my blog again and seeing that she said that she's mad at me for not informing my blogger audience about anything.... this blog is dedicated to her!! Haha oh Lauren. Hmmm ok I know you all have questions and because people are so nosey these days, once again thanks to Lauren, haha, I'm just going to tell you everything you wish to know.    How did this all start?   Ok so it started around valentines week and  ya we just started talking more and then at the dance we danced and what not and then I came to a thinking? Hmmm maybe I do like this kid, haha, and I'm sure Janelle would want me to point out that she did help alittle with the hooking up, haha. And then Aaron and I came to talking and blah blah blah from there.    Did you guys even talk outside of Echo and hang out?  That would be yes. As I said earlier we started talking a lot more and yes lame we talked mostly online, but yes sometimes on the phone and then more in school. And ok we only really hung out outside of school once, besides seeing each other at the dance and what not. Last Saturday night we hung out. And yes ya'll must be thinking, wow why to jump into a relationship. But clearly we knew eachother before, it's not like we just met. And we'd been talking and knowing eachother and what not for awhile. We kind of went on a spure of the moment thing and just based everything on guts and instinct so we're just going by the flow.   How did he ask you or when did he ask you or did you ask him?   He asked me. About 1 in the morning Sunday night or technically Monday morning. Yeah we're retards. And ya we're even more losers because it was online!!! Ok actually that would make him more of a loser, haha, jk..... sorta..... haha. But know, he did admit that it was extremely lame and ya he couldn't use the phone 'cause well ya..... but ya again spure of the moment. But I do expect maybe a re-asking out in a not so lame way (hint hint if you are reading!). Haha, but ya that's how, sadly, but the truth.    What about this whole jewish thing?  Ok so we, and with the help of others, have made a list and I am pretty much qualified as a jew. But hmmm ya there's still some stuff needed to be figured out I think in this department.  Hmm don't really feel like getting anymore deeper into my life. Maybe if you're special I'll tell you more, or you can just wait till my next blog and see what I have to say. So I was saying how I wish I could find a guy on valentines day in my last blog..... maybe I did find my prince charming after all :)!  Muah! Kati          "

2310,Virgo,"           How do you deal with a broken heart? Is there some special formula, or are we reduced to just filling ourselves with loosely tested, overly prescribed blue pills, red pills? I think I'll forgo that, choosing to feel the genuine pain of love lost rather than the numbness of not feeling anything. Or worse, throwing myself into work, or just generally keeping busy, as they prescribe. 'Are you keeping busy, dear?' Jam packing my itinerary has never been a solution to solving life's 'little' problems. It sure takes our minds off things for a while, though. But, eventually we have to deal with things. Things like:   The two things I thought would never happen again: 1) I never thought I'd fall in love again. 2) I certainly didn't think I'd get my heart broken again.   But I guess that's the chance you take when you risk everything. It is the ultimate exposé, the final showdown, the opportunity to show everything you have in your secret cache and in one’s individual Pandora's Box.   All these people drinking lover's spit.                                                 Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink.  As scared as I was to say it, in the end I did and I'm glad I did because I meant it and he really meant something very significant to me.   I love you.  And if it was said on the last night we were potentially to be together, that's alright, I can live with that. I know I did the best I could do and was the best I could be, given the circumstances of profound bad timing.    How can you compete with a ghost? No, she's not dead, but they spent 10 years together, during the very formative decade between the ages 20 - 30. She's moved on. A different life. Abandoning him. He the one who loved her so much. Maybe not romantically after all of those years, but certainly a familial love, that binding love, that blinding love that was ripped away from him before it was time. Before he was ready.   I'd said before how new love stirs things up. I counted this morning how many men I'd claimed to love in my relative short existence. Nine. How many did I truly love? Would walk to the ends of the earth for? Would sacrifice life and limb for? Not all. So maybe it wasn’t true love. That's always been a quest for me. True love and the possibility of its existence. Far more than seeing if God really exists.  I need to believe it does.  I'm puffy from crying, relenting finally this morning to remove the remains of the rivulet roadmap of mascara down my cheeks. A poor version of Alice Cooper. A sadder version, far less evil. I feel like I'm close to exhausting my friend pool for emotional support. I need guidance. Comfort. He needs the same. A sage that is empathetic, someone who can tell him he's not alone and what he's feeling is totally normal and in at least one time in our pathetic lives we've been hurt so badly that we can't distinguish waking life from a dream state, a surreality that doesn't make us want to feel anything, especially the pain we're feeling right now.   We search in vain for clarity. We need concise answers for the things we feel because they don't make any sense to us at all. 'If only I could get my shit together....' We live in this world where there are always solutions to problems, or at least they work the bugs out the beta version with version 10.97. Things are packaged neatly in eye-pleasing colours and boxes. The whodunnit's villian eloquently and correctly accused discovered in the third act by the elegant detective with the Belgian accent, twirling his handlebar moustache, tapping his silver handled cane on the the parquet floor. But unfortunately the ways of the world don’t necessarily work that way.  At one time in my not so recent past, I wanted answers so desperately I went to see psychics (plural).  Fuck, I can still smell him.  Anyway, back to the psychics. I wanted to know about a certain fella I’d been with a few years back, then rekindled something several months ago. They all promised he would come back. And I was so patient. One of them prophecised there would be a choice I’d have to make, between him and another man. In the end she said I’d choose the one in first chronological order. But then I met Jeremy. Was he the other I’d have to choose from? Two days ago there was no choice. After being with Jeremy he really raised the bar in standards certification. The psychics didn’t tell me anything about him. He was a surprise. I think in my path I became happier not really knowing. The worst thing about being told your “future” is once you know about it you have this tendency to wait around for the future to happen. “Is it going to be today,” you ask yourself for the 14th consecutive time that day. “How about now?”  What is certain is uncertainty. What dispells fear is the choice to love again. And here on just that topic: the righteous chicks, the Bene Gesserit, from the movie Dune, delivering a little litany against fear:   I must not fear.  Fear is the mind-killer.  Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.  I will face my fear.  I will permit it to pass over me and through me.  And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.  Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.  Only I will remain.    And I’m not talking perfect love, because again, perfection is unachievable and even if it wasn’t it would be pretty damned boring to have to face day after day. “Oh, here’s comes Perfect, again.” Tedious. Predictable. We’d resent it. Him.  Yes, I got hurt but that’s okay. I learned so much about myself during the entire, albeit brief process of loving someone new. And I got to love someone again. Someone really great. So, I consider myself lucky. [She said through gritted teeth as 1st runner-up, allowed to perform pageant-of-life duties only if the winner was unable].          "
2311,Virgo,"       heh heh...this is definatly gonna be long. Ok so yesterday. Me Dani and Nicole had been plannin to drink hypnotic but Tom was home so we were like ok thts not gonna happen lol so were bummed b/c we thought we weren't gonna do ne thing. Then Alex called Nicole and asked her if he would meet her @ CVS he seemed really upset so even though he like pocketed our $$ and he interupted our doritos binge (which we took ne wayz) lol we walked down bein the good samaritians we are. Then like we went to Cisoros and sat inside and talked for awhile and then we decided that we were gonna go to a park and drink the vodka tht Nicole brought and whisky tht i brought. So we went back to Nicole's and while we were goin back Alex was like do you wanna go swimmin, and we were all kinda like umm well like nah, and he was like we can stop by each of ur houses and get ur suits but all of us had straight hair and we didnt feel like it lol so then when we got out he was waiting down the street lol he was like my boy Jay (Jason) is gonna pick us up at washburns so we can go swimming. So, we get in the car and like im thinkin tht like were gonna go to his house or something like tht or like a park u know so next thing i know were headin north on the Palisades past bear mountain and over the bear mountain bridge to westchester LOL, me and Dani were like WTF is goin on lol. And we had been drinkin the vodka and whiskey @ tht point so like lol Nicole had drunk a little too much and at this point she was like is her words 'u guys im fucked up' she must have said tht like 4 million times lol. So ne wayz when we get there Nicole is like shitfaced lol so like then we have to hike through the woods LOL and shes like stumblin and like were all like oh god and then we have to go down all these hills and stuff (and all us girls were in flipflops lol) so we finally get to the place were gonna swim, omg it was sooooo pretty. I mean the water was this deep blue color and it was just so pretty, and then i was pissed bc i didnt bring my suit!! lol i thought we were gonna swim in a pool, o well.  So then we hung out and Nicole was bein like freakin retarded lol but we all had a good laugh 'don't laugh at me, i dont like it when u laugh at me, colleen when im sober were not gonna be friends' me dani and lex finished up the vodka and whiskey and after i took my last swig of the whiskey i felt a little tipsy lol but i wasnt like sayin dumb things or slurring. Then we get back (me dani and jay, nicole was waaaaaay behind and alex was helpin her) and this cop is like go tell ur friend im gonna tow his car (he had gone back to see where the hell alex and nicole were) so then he was talkin to the cop, he was competly sober but nicole u could just look @ her and see she wasnt. So we got nicole in the car while alex and jay talked to the cop, but omg it scared the shit outta me bc if he had said ne thing to nicole or nicole said ne thing we woulda been in trouble. So we left and it turns out Jay has a really good taste in music, we listened to slipknot, korn, in flames and a bunch of other kool shit. Dark and heavy it was the shit. I personally didnt wanna leave bc i was havin fun and i liked jay he's really kool, but he's 20 so lol he's not gonna go for a 16yr old, but i better not tell tht to nicole. So we went to the texco station and at tht point me and nicole hadda pee soooooo bad lol, i mean really fukin bad b/c i always do when i drink and ive nvr drank tht much. so when nicole went this guy started to open the door and she yelled 'ahhhhh im not done' or something like tht LOL the guy was like tell ur friend to shut the door next time lol. It was sooo funny. Then we got this Blue Hawaiian drink and Alex bought it and they didnt id him so yea we know where were gonna get stuff from now on lol. Then Jay hadda get the car back and they ran into there friend who was like gonna follow them and drop jays car off @ his house and then meet us @ lowland park, so they dropped us off there and we ran down went on the merry go round and like drank the bottle in like 2 minutes flat lol, we just kept passin it. Then we wait 4 awhile and they still haddnt called so we decided tht we were gonna go 2 ciseros bc like Dani and nicole werent feelin well... i felt bad. And so i wanted them to eat, so we called them and they were still @ the guys house they were gonna call us when they got closer. Then we ate talked about the day and how it was nothin like we planned and talked about the guys, how alex would b cute if he was taller and like how we all liked jason, but just for the record dani wasnt attracted to him lol... but yea i liked him, he seemed nice and i liked his eyes, and he had good taste in music but he's 20 lol. Then we called them again bc it was gettin later and my dad  and danis mom were gonna get us @ 9 30, and they said tht his friend was gettin in trouble by his mom so we were like were just gonna go back 2 nicole's. So we went back but when we did nicole saw her neighbor and me and dani we in and nicole asked him if he had it and he was like i got u and left so we decided to go out and wait for him so we went outside and waited and took some dumb pictures and yea tht was tht and then my dad came and picked me up. OMG we seriously needa do tht again but next time were gonna do it right and say were gonna sleep over and then just like hang out w/ them later lol.

I've realized recently, I don't have as many true friends as I thought I did, just acquaintainces, and that is something I've never really brought to my reality. Sad but true.  No headaches, for about 4 days now !!! Terrific news!!  I feel alot of pain because I'm not as close to certain family members. I think back and its not any different from being in Wichita. No phone calls, no letters. Although I do see this person once in a while, I don't really get to talk to her. I hate it. I want to be closer to someone in my family. I want to really feel like someone cares. I mean this person decided on a date for an important event, and where it was going to be, and didn't bother to tell me, but told everyone else. I hate feeling like an outsider. I want my own family. I want my own place in life.  I want my own place in this world. Although it is a world, I would never want to own up to. It is an angry evil place. I want to find the good in life. I want to go with what I truely believe, that most people are good. I want to see it for myself though.   Not sure what else to say...  Although I am bothered, because Calin said I seemed to be cold lately. And then he wouldn't explain himself. It makes my heart ache. Although it already does because I miss him so. I keep having this feeling, that we are wasting our time, and no matter what we do, we won't be together. I know that is my negativeness, but no matter how much I try and stay positive about out future that comes to me.  I just feel like curling up in a ball and crying right now. Feeling so alone, and lonely..  and not wanted...  I'm hurting alot inside.  I need to be held. I need to be loved.   One day I will find what I need.                "

2315,Gemini,"       Is Bubbles really lonely? I tried to observe her today, i realised although mabel and i give her alot of love and care, the 2 of us actually make no attempt to play with her. Little bubs is always jumping around, she follows me everywhere in the apartment and constantly having Bo Bo (her bestfrend) in her mouth. So i decided to play catching with her in the house today. I chase bubs round and round and round the house hehehe. I kind of a enjoyed it. Never realise Bubs can be such a great entertainment. Someone used to tell me, most people will get tired of their dog one day and it wouldn't mean so much to you anymore. However, i have yet to experience it and as for now it works the other way . My love for Bubs definitely grow deeper by the days. She is the last thing i look at before i sleep and the first thing i look for when i wake up. I kiss Bubs at least 10 times everyday and im always thinking about her when im not home. I thank God for teaching me to love Bubs everyday. Its so strange, even though Bubs is just a little doggie i own less than 6 months she means so much to me. That also goes to tell me when i lose Bubs one day, I know i will be extremely upset. I think i will cry for 1 month or even more. To lose something that once means so much is for sure going to be very painful. So for now, better not think so much. The problem with me is i think too too long term at times.  There are a few people i like to thank in my blog tonight. Gwen, thanks for being such a sweet angel. A friend though we have not known long, your words of encouragement certainly brought alot of smiles on my face. I thank God for this new friendship. Lid, thanks for all the lunches. Even though its only an hour each time i enjoyed your company. I thank God for bringing u back to Melbourne. You are such a 'siao bao'. Mabel, thanks for the Nasi Lemak. Its so yummy...Even though your ADHD is pretty serious but you know i love u deep deep because you are such a Mother Theresa. And lastly, to my ex housemate, lemuel, i miss u so much and all the 'wan an' and hugZzz  . T hanks for calling that nite and contantly finding something negative to say about my blog and body parts. Even though you are so irritating, you can't park a Tarago plus a mild ADHD because im so use to having you being part of my life in Melbourne, its so difficult not to love you.

2319,Leo,"       For those that don't know, and since everyone that reads this knows me I'm talking to no one that's likely to see this, I play in a pool tournament every thursday night. Last week I did pretty bad, the word dismal comes to mind. Losing is one thing, but missing a bunch of easy shots is another. To put it plainly; I just plain sucked.  However this was a new week and my sucking seemed to have abated because I came out swinging this time and I was dropping fools like that's what they were made for.  Well, I guess I could remember it that way if I were drinking or doing some heavy drugs. In reality I got lucky in alot of games and owe many victories to the person I was playing choking or getting really lucky with a leave.  My luck ran out in the last two games. This is a double elimination tournament so that means everyone can lose twice and the winner of the winners bracket plays the winner of the losers bracket. This means that the last person in the winners brackets has to be beaten twice by the last person in the losers bracket, which is exactly what happened, with a little help from me. For me the only important shot in both those games was the last on of the second game.  The eight ball was sitting on the side pocket and I had a clear shot at it. I took carefull aim and hit with just a little right english to make sure that I didn't follow it into the side pocket and took my shot. I had hit to hard and the right english carried the cue ball right down the table and into the corner.  Ohh well, it happens. Sometimes I feel like the whole thing is a luck game anyways.  And that's all I have to say about that.           "

2321,Pisces,"             This might be my first blog from the air. I am 3/4 of the way back to NYC from an extended stay on the West Coast. While here in the air, I want to wish Team Mogpac well on their first dodgeball game, currently being played somewhere in the big apple. I hope Matt Gentile will report the results here on the blog and I look forward to participating in the next round of what we call MOG Athletics. Considering it was Irene’s idea, I should participate.  A lot happened on my LA journey and it’s hard to remember it all because I’m so tired, but I’ll try to give you the update, as I did actually work on things to benefit the world of MOG. I won’t get too deep into my adventures at E3 as it was a massive headache and basically a huge arcade on steroids. I did enjoy seeing some of the new games and in particular, the new tech. I think we’re all going to be playing the Playstation Portable in the next few years. It was also fun to see my man Evan walk the floor of this convention like a massive rockstar (He’s an important game reviewer in the real world). The convention is huge, it’s loud. Note to self: next time bring aspirin.  Quick story: on my way to the convention, LA’s finest pulled me over for jumping into the HOV lane (like an idiot I pulled right in front of a fucking cop). However, upon seeing my Ipod in the front seat, the two policemen, who shall remain nameless, and I got into a conversation about their desire to play their Ipod in their police car. When they learned I was going to E3, I not only avoided a ticket, I also got a police escort for my trouble. Only in LA kids.  Anyhow, at a party held in honour of my lawyer/agent/advisor, Leo V23 and I huddled into a corner to discuss our musical work for the upcoming week in LA while also trying to avoid (unsuccessfully) as many entertainment industry types as possible. With our game plan set, Leo and I spent a few nights in the wee hours working on the new HF song OUR FAITH. We had been looking for Leo to come through with his unique style of atmospheric guitar playing and singing and boy did my second favourite Argentinean come through. We took what was a wall of guitars and britrock and turned into a sexy explosion of the subtly and noise. Tons of loops were removed and by doing so, the melodies really came through while also making Robin’s drums really stand out. Leo laid down some beautiful guitars and even better vocals, in Spanish no less. I used my skills in an arranging capacity and we have a brand new and interesting song that is a million times better than what I walked in there with.  Leo is used to being a solo performer, but I was really impressed with how collaborative he was. Working with him was no different than working with my best collaborators: Brandt, Ash and Robin. He would listen carefully to my ideas and even if he thought some of them wouldn’t work, he would try them, which sometimes led to him being surprised, me being surprised and most importantly, really allowing us to push the material forward. After working with “producers” and “musicians” whose egos and need to be in charge overwhelms everyone else in the room to the point where they won’t let anyone push the music forward because of their own insecurities, Leo was a joy to work with and has a place in the Factor Corporation any day.   On the topic of Leo, in between all of this I managed to catch the debut gig of his newest project AM Pacific, which continues the musical style he began several years with his previous project Sutra. This was at a private party filled mostly with hipster douches out in Los Feliz, the Williamsburg of Los Angeles (Fuck you, Fury). Leo had a very simple set up of himself on guitars and vocals, one girl on lead vocals, and another girl on vocals and trumpet (who was amazing). Beats and loops were run through a PA via Leo’s Ipod. They came on late and the people were annoying, but damn was this short set worth it. The AM trio was excellent and really delivered a beautiful set and the best cover of Chris Issak’s WICKED GAME you will ever hear.  Meanwhile I worked on artwork for a potential HF single, while my 3 cohorts teamed up with Ass Cobra’s amazing bassist Charles to work on a potential B-side, which they have titled DESCRIPTIVE. An mp3 was sent my way of the material written for this song and boy am I excited. I had a few requests of what I would like to hear in a B-side and the Factor Corp really stepped up to the plate. I’m already writing vocal melodies. I hope Brandt will go into detail about the making of this song somewhere here.  Luckily Brandt took the space to review Morrissey’s new one and I’m happy to say I’m loving the album. Another amazing return to form by a legend of days past. We need Moz and he has not let us down. Duran was the comeback of 03, and Moz is truly the comeback of 04. Thank God.  My celebrity sightings included former Melrose Place douche Patrick Muldoon, the Legendary Mickey Rourke, Apollo Creed himself Carl Weathers, current Playboy cover star Charisma Carpenter (who I was tempted to ask why she refused to show her nether regions in said photo spread, thus making the spread quite Maxim instead of Playboy), and the man Dan Hamill and I call Mr. 100 Million Dollars: Oliver Martinez, who might be the one human being Brandt hates the most on this planet besides Benicio Del Toro (who is on the airplane movie screen right now in 21 Grams). Oliver was sans Kylie, but was wearing these horrible glasses that reminded me of Dan Hamill Circa 1993. Not good. Special thanks to my friends at Ca’Brea for sitting my lawyer/agent/advisor and myself at a better table that the movie stars.  Also, the highlight of my trip was spent with the younger crowd, including the new Fury baby, in from San Fran (it was fun seeing Bradley J. Fox and my sister Dee Dee looking into their future of parenthood while playing with the Fury child). And of course, as much time as possible was spent my 5 year old nephew, who becoming more of a clone of my girlfriend every day, just as my small cousin has become a Star Wars loving Benihana eating clone of me.  Oh I saw TROY and the best part was seeing the trailer for CONSTANTINE.  New York approaches. More, much more, soon!  F          "
2322,Capricorn,"       I use FireFox for more then 1 reason and I just thought you might benefit from them if I posted it.  1.) Popup Blocker. Internet Explorer users often get bombarded by popups. I have a built in popup blocker and if I would want to see the pops on one page I just simply press the small icon that appears at the bottom left of the window.  2.) Tabbed Interface. My dad (an avid I.E. user) likes to show me stuff he finds on the internet. When I finally go over to the office to see what he wants to show me I see him going through about 20 different windows just to find it. With Firefox a simple press of ctrl+T opens  a new 'tab' which shows up right under my Bookmarks toolbar and has a short description. Right now I see 'Oompas Blog. :: Create New Post', 'Oompas Blog.', and 'Firefox - The Browser, Reloaded'. This allows me to update my blog. Check it once I have updated it. And look through the Mozilla website for updates.  3.) Bookmark Toolbar. I see my mom constantly open up her bookmarks on IE to find a game to play. I am just 1 click away from any bookmark I have. Firefox comes with this handy dandy bookmarks toolbar. When you bookmark something it gives you the option to put it into the bookmarks toolbar. Once its their you just click the name you gave your bookmark and boom your at the website.  4.) Customizable Toolbars. Hate how IE is organized? Well I do. So once I got Firefox I just made a new navigation toolbar. It has all I need and not the extra crap I hate. I just right clicked on the main toolbar and clicked customize and just went from their clicked and dragged the options I wanted into the space I wanted and TADA all done and better then ever.  5.) Quick Downloads. In internet explorer you have to go through quite a bit to download something. In Firefox just pick if it should be opened by the default program or saved to the desktop. Then you will get a little download window and if you don't want to see it just exit out of it and the file will still keep downloading.  Well that's it. I hope I can convert some of you IE users. Heres the link to FireFox. http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/    "

Tears dripping out of my eyes Asking, questioning:  'Why did you lie? You missed your chance – that dream come true Now you’re left without her, all alone – just you. Maybe it’s cause you thought too much, You questioned the truth,  Said it wasn’t enough. But what can be more honest that truth? A truth that rests so deep. In your heart. In you. You must have been scared. Of what, may we ask? Were you afraid of it all? Did it seem too fast? If you ask us that’s garbage A bullshit excuse. A way to get out of what would have happened to you. At first that seems fine, Since it would have ruined your life, But at second glace we see it won’t detract from the strife. With or without that kiss that night, She will always be that every-glowing light. That light that outshines everyone else in the world With or without it, she’ll always be the only girl.'

That and there's enough pollen in the air down here to make everyone sneeze and sniffle.  We had a wonderful visit catching up with my Great Aunt Jean and Uncle Lowell over lunch. They spend their winters not far from here. They treated us to lunch at Chili's, and we enjoyed getting to know them better. It's always fun to talk to people who knew your parents as kids and babysat them. They told some good stories about my Mom that we'd never heard before! Like shoplifting a candy bar? And cutting Uncle Lowell's hair? We're planning to visit them again at their place before they head north in a month.  As we were driving home we got a voicemail from Ked's Dad asking if we had gotten snow like they had this morning. Ked smirked and rolled the windows all the way down for our ride home! In further defiance of the cold and misery of March that our fine friends of the north are facing, we decided to walk down the street for an ice cream treat!

2339,Pisces,"       A teacher from my past, given to axiomatic instruction, chided me with these words.   Today we may be engaging in a series of house transactions that we’ve been working on for a long time.   When in the midst of such interactions there are many choices to make, and Lynn and I are committed to making them together.    Making decisions  together  is one of the more difficult features of being human.  Consensus becomes truer and truer the longer you know one another, and the longer you talk about any issue.  Unfortunately, it also becomes more difficult.    In our case, since we’ve made these decisions together before, and because we like each other a lot – we know that there are unique features of each-other’s take on things that are really valuable.  But what we don’t know is which feature of which person’s personhood is going to end up mattering in the story we tell ourselves about this decision AFTER its made and completed.   We're writhing together.  My teacher used to bellow the title of this blog in the Imperative Tone – Amped Up On Steroids.  And there’s something about the level of confidence with which one says something that actually weights the credibility of the statement beyond its own merits.    Tammie has started pointing out to me that my years of debate have lent me just such a blustery tone of surety which often is attached to statements which are at best – probabilities and at worst – subjective perspectives.  Brendon and Janson and I, when we stayed up til three and four in the morning in Lawlor Hall debating the morality of going 57 in a 55 – employed this tactic of false surety with all sorts of permutations:   I read somewhere that… There’s been research done… It’s been proven…  And the best is always when you include a statistic with a very specific and esoteric number.   The truth is  (note the surety in my tone)  that indecision is not just a skewer –   It’s actually a pretty fertile ground where relationships may grow…  It’s a rupture in the sometimes stifling surety which we rely upon in the quotidian flow…  Looking for a new axiom, I invent:   Exult on the rope swing of indecision…  Dance through the gloam of indecision…  Jump into the pool of indecision…  Coast on the surf of indecision…   …if only they didn’t want landings and sunset and the solid ground of dry land…   may your indecision be full of…   peace~        "

I don't like being poked... I love hugs.  My favorite color is green... a shade somewhere between sage and celery...  I save worms from terrible deaths.  When I actually eat food at Winsteads I order a fried egg sandwich with tomato.  I have a tendecy to switch letters in words around {matato}  I believe that peaches are the nectar of the gods.

I don't really cry.  I'm kind of clumsy {maybe really clumsy} I am terrified of the dark.  My favorite inspirational quote is in French, and I don't speak french. { le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne connait point. }  I've gone through somethings that no one should ever have to go through {most people have} and I've finally gotten over it. {yes really, finally.

I wish I could pack up a box of all the food I don't eat anyway and send it to the starving people.  I want to be good, but most of the time I am not.  In general, I am a mediocre person... but I'm very lucky, so that makes up for it.  I have never had a ballet class before in my life, but I turn pirouettes across the kitchen while I'm unloading the dishwasher.  I have a love/hate relationship with my best friend.

2344,Capricorn,"                 I was thinking more about what I wrote earlier (What Would A Novel Be Without Sin?). I think if we didn't have sin, not only would we lose those wonderful good vs. evil plots, but we'd lose the interesting part of our characters. If everyone was perfect, than we wouldn't have the interest of our sins combined with our virtues to make characters with struggles that are unique to who they are but similar to ours in the fact that we are human. I think that some of the most interesting things in novels are the characters' flaws and virtues and how they drive the plot, rather than the plot driving them. Does that make any sense? Oh well, sometimes my thoughts flow too fast for words to express them with clarity.      "

This Queen had homework to do (joy) and this helped her writing streak tremendously, just singin' the song by Level 42:    How, How can it be That a love, carved out of caring Fashioned by fate Could suffer so hard From the games, Played once too often But making mistakes Is a part of Life's imperfections Born of the years is it so wrong To be human after all?  Drawn into the stream Of undefined illusion.... Those diamond dreams They can't disguise the truth That there is somethin' about you Baby, so right I wouldn't be here wihtout you baby tonight.  If ever our love Was concealed No one can say that We didn't feel  A million things And a perfect dream of life.  Gone...fragile but free We remain...tender together If not so in love And it's not so wrong We're only human after all  These changing years They add to your confusion Oh and you need to hear The time that told the truth  You know there's something about you Baby So right.... I wouldn't be here without you baby tonight.           "
2350,Gemini,"       Had my review today, it went well. Ate a chicken parmesan sammich, it was a 5 out of 10. Had chunks of vegetables in it, so that's a big point deduction right there. I survived Karate and only hurt for a few days. I didn't go back right away because I was feeling very sick to my stomache and that's never a good way for me to exercise. I want to take things easy at first. So I plan to go again tonight.    "
2351,Scorpio,"       THIS DOESN'T MATTER. I DON'T CARE!  I  DON'T  CARE!   It's like playing the same cd over and over and you up hating just the first song because its the only one you listen to, and you just let the rest p  l  a  y        p  l  a  y       p  l  a  y  and I miss you,     horribly  I let the word roll across my tongue, so it sounds like I don't mean it.  It's like seeing the mirror, seeing  me  and the darkness that  disturbs  me residing under my eyes.   I stare with hatred at this one dimentional creature and the mirror   cracks    like lightning... broken, the bad luck already written across the palm of my hand, the palm I press against you, pushing  you away.  It leaves a stain, and I cry  myself to sleep.  Ironic, the connection,  the falling rain       falling down my face. singing me to sleep. yes::::::::::::::::::::::          s        l           e              e              p.     I wonder who  'you'  is. It could be  you   It could be the one. or it could be HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED {ha ha, harrypotter} because we just don't want to talk about it. You wonder if its YOU don't you? Sometimes it is.   A lot of times it is, but you can't differentiate, and it doesn't matter anyway.  There is a reason you don't know who you are.  You can't make the connections, the things you know about me.  Do you really know anything about me?  You. do.   You know too much, and yet still not enough  My maze {ha ha!}  perhaps you are lost.... of course you are, this is my maze and  I  don't even know where I am.      "
2352,Capricorn,"           Well, Adam, our school system really is not all that complex. Most students start off in kindergarten (some German word we stole...why, I don't know). Then you have 12 years of school before heading off to Uni (assuming you pass each grade in 1 year...some people need more than that--they ride the short bus to school). Grades K (kindergarten) through 5 are generally called primary, elementary, or grade school, depending on where you're at in the country. Then grades 6-8 are called middle school or junior high, unless your junior high happens to be grades 7-9 and your grade school happens to be grades K-6. Or, if you go to parochial (Catholic) school, you usually go to the same school for grades K-8, which in Chicago we call grammar school. I don't know what they call it elsewhere. Then it's off to high school, which nowadays is usually grades 9-12, often called freshman (9), sophomore (10), junior (11), and senior (12). Many high schools used to be only grades 10-12, and some specialty schools still are, like the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy. Then, after high school, it's off too Uni, which we usually call college. College years are usually referred to as freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior just like high school. This is the undergraduate curriculum. Then, if you so choose, there is graduate school. This would be like the 5th year at ESADE, but it is generally longer than 1 year, and you can earn a Master's degree, or a doctorate if you study longer. So you see, it's really quite simple. The system pretty much runs like this everywhere in the country, though they might have different names for some of the schools. Got it? Well, back to work with me. Please post any and all questions concerning the above system :)  Tim          "
2353,Leo,"           Lately, two questions have been racing thru my head: 'Why do I feel the need to set my head on fire at family reunions?' and 'Did I build that hedge maze out front just to piss off the mailman?' No answers seem to be in sight. At least I've got my sanity. And my army of lawn gnomes. Oh, and those neato pieces of that guy's fence that look just like the top of a cherry pie. I wonder why he won't let me mow his yard anymore? They say idle hands do the devil's work. what about hands holding a bloody chainsaw in a nursing home? what kind of work are they doing? Hey, If I got shot 30,000 times, would I be a tragedy? I mean, when one person dies, the news doesn't seem to care as much as when somebody kills off a whole big group of people. So if I was to get kshot enough times to kill a whole herd of people, would I qualify as a tragedy? What if I made up a new religion right before I got killed? would I be a martyr then? I think it would be neat to be a martyr, it's just that I don't really like the idea of having to be dead first - I couldn't enjoy it if I was dead.         "
2354,Gemini,"        Mmmm Rain   I love that it gets to everyone else. I love that in some way, shape or form, the rain manages to make someone feel something deep inside. I don't care that it's annoyance or sheer joy.   What this Queen loves the most is how almost everyone she knows associates any amount of rainfall or storming with her. It's not entirely far off from the truth...I really do try to portray a piece of myself to those that I care about on a level. The best way I can do that is by varying ways of rain. Oh I'm sure no one actually believes I send it there, but it's nice all the same to know I'm thought of at least once in a while. What better way to be remembered than by the deep, thrilling roll of thunder, the brilliance of a lightning streak in the dark cloudy skies or be seen in the single drop of rain off a finger tip? It's my honour and I can ask for no greater legacy as Queen than to be tied with so fine an element.   *curtsy*  You all do me honour          "

2357,Capricorn,"           Hey i think its time for my weeks update which has been fairly busy.  On Saturday my parents went to Italy to ski, I was hoping for a wild week and even though I wasnt home alone I did think that I would have a good time since I the oldest and can beat my siblings up if I want the remote control. But no the teachers decided to ask us for 7 projects in the same week and 4 of those in the same subject! We were very anoyed by one of those coz' we had to ask 30 people what were the first three things that came to mind when some brand was mentioned. We figured this had little if anything to do with our marketing studies but the teacher is making her on research on that subject so it was very handy to get us to do all the hard work. Anyway I stayed in the school all day for that week and only once I came home to eat, so Im just glad its over.  I was pretty certain I would have to go out on friday coz' just to have some good time this week so I signed up for the sience trip on Friday. In this one we went to Iceland Express which is similar to Ryanair but only flies from Iceland to Denmark and England. They had a lecture on the company for half an hour maybe more and gave free beer while talking, usually they give free bear during the lecture and then for an hour afterwards but they didnt have enough so we had to start buying right after which sucked. I once again had to play the drunk Icelander and got completely out of hand, hit on a exchange student (you have to be friendly) and then went home with some girl which was a huge waste of money. the worst sex ever and cap expenses were in total something like 50 $. Today I went to play football, it was surely a hangover ball coz' I didnt have the strength to run after anything so i just stayed in goal and passed the ball up the field.  My dad just bought the sport channel for one month (not the actual channell) so Ive watch some football on tv, on Wednesday I watched Man City against Tottenham coz' Icelands national keeper just signed for the prior and played the match. It was a great match coz' Tottenham were 3-0 nil up at halftime and at halftime one City player got redcarded. So there wasnt much hope, but the match ended 4-3 and Arni Gautur had an outstanding match, Schmeichel said he had the save of the season so he did pretty well.  Thats it for now.  Later, Úlli  p.s. I just signed up Kat so I hope she will start bloging soon.         "
2358,Gemini,"            Expected!!!!. This is a necessity for the Communist party, if at all they want to keep their base intact. They have grown through confrontation and their identity is confrontation, armed or otherwise. The Congress had to come to terms with this cocky attitude of ommunists- else, the Govt might not last for it's term. They still live in the Ivory Towers and they also dream of bringing IT&ITES Industry under Trade-Unions. I am afraid if their confrontaionist approach will spoil the IT&ITES Sector also. When the seat of Communism- West Bengal itself has told that IT&amp;ITES sector is out of Strikes, I dont know why they need to take up these issues and reduce the attractiveness? The HR dept of all these Firms themselves deal with these issues quite effectively and the workers there arent 'Proletariat' for the Trade Unions to intervene.          "
2359,Virgo,"        On Ninja's, 40z, and the like...  So last night I met up with my blokes.  I couldn't meet up with them until later as I have a very complex social life.  I get there and they're all a 40 oz and some change of the Magnum ahead of me.  This is code for: They were shit canned.  Evidently while on a mission to get me a 40 while i'm en route, Lars took a spill into a puddle of mud.  His clothes are filthy, his ego damaged, and his wrist hurt, he still accomplishes the mission of 40 attainment.  The night goes on with more drinking, and dicking around.  Now, one thing you have to know about Lars....the more he drinks, the more he insists on practicing his Te Kwon Do.  This doods all over the shit.  Drunken master sitting there with a 40 in hand, eyes half open and doing his ninja moves.  God bless ya Lars!    "
2360,Cancer,"                 I hate being sick. That's what I've been doing the last four days or so. Walking around made me dizzy and weak, but lying down made my head hurt from being pressed against the pillow (not kidding).  So I slept and sat on the couch and played Final Fantasy Tactics Advance when I felt a little better.  I feel almost normal now except for a hacking cough that keeps waking me up at night. Conversations with God says that every experience you call into your life serves some purpose, so I wondered about the purpose of this one, as I always wonder what possible purpose a little fever or cold could serve. Okay, I can see that if you're stressed or making yourself too busy, getting sick would be your body's way of slowing you down and saying, 'hey, enough of this.' However, as I'm out of school with no car and no job, neither of those apply to me (and never really did, except when I had to write that term paper in high school). In any case, I've come to the conclusion that:   1) Once again, I take simple joy in feeling healthy and normal, as I'm reminded every time I get sick.   2) My mother does a lot more for the rest of my family does for her, myself included (she took care of me when she wasn't working).  3) I need to shift my focus from what I don't have (job, relationship, etc) to what I do have, right here, right now.  I was worried about the slowness of my job search; I felt frustrated because I couldn't see my friends or go anywhere since I can't drive my dad's new manual Nissan (he's in Taiwan at the moment and can't teach me). But one day I was sitting on my bed and staring (because lying down gave me a headache and focusing too long on a book or my GBA made me nauseous) when I realized that this situation I am in now is perfect for bonding with my mother. With my dad and brother gone temporarily, we have some peace in the house and time together with none of the frustrations those two bring.  She'll be working for most of tomorrow, but I can also help make this house (esp. my room) a bit more livable by cleaning things up, bathing my dog and taking him for a walk. Anyway, I won't bore you with the details. I think I've been getting clues that this is what I'm supposed to be doing, but I didn't make a conscious connection until that moment. It was a feeling of 'I get it now,' like something clicking into place, and by extention, I felt that the job thing and everything else will come when the time comes. Well, neato, and I guess tomorrow's cleaning day.                 "

2366,Leo,"       Well, I guess I lied. I have been updating this blog, more even than the others I know with blogs update theirs. I guess I should have called it 'Don't read my boring ass blog that has bad spelling and doesn't have any updates you will care to read because I never really do anything important anyways.', but that title seems a bit long.  Before I forget I'd like to give a big shoutout to  Isabella Wunder  for linking to me, though she could have used slightly better link text than 'Boring Ass' but I guess you have to take it how it comes. I'd also like to give a big shout out to  Miss Macy  and  Ember  I guess the Benicia crew is in da house or off the hook something.   Reguarding my dreams, it seems that my sunconscious picked up on my distaste for my recent dreams and game me a little treat last night. I had a dream I was playing a dope ass team based FPS similar to Tribes but with really good graphics and you could control players with your mind. However it wasn't all good, I had to put the game system together before I could play the game and even then my step dad was watching the whole time grunting about wanting to watch tv.

2369,Aquarius,"                 As we sat along the roadside for the THIRD time today we both kinda lost it. Well not, kinda, we did for a moment lose it. Two weeks ago as we were headed to Sarasota to help my grandma with some projects around the house the car randomly died! So we coasted along the side of the road from 70 miles an hour to a complete stop. We looked at each other in complete surprise. The car has run great for the year and a half we’ve had it and this was the first sign of any trouble. We called a tow truck and then called my grandma and she and a friend came to meet us at the shop in Bradenton. Fortunately, we weren’t too far from Sarasota. We could definitely see God’s provision in the fact that the car didn’t break down while I was driving it by myself (I’m sure I would be ok, but being in a big city now, I’m not thrilled about breaking down!) and Grandma’s friend was just getting to walk out the door when we called and he knew exactly where we were and was happy to come with her to pick us up. Naturally, as soon as we get to the shop the car starts right up, even though we’d tried to start it for over an hour alongside the road. Two weeks and two shops later, it’s running fine and no one can find anything wrong with it.  So, we head to Sarasota again to help my Grandma with the projects we didn’t get to finish two weeks ago. With two bathroom ventilation fans in our trunk we get almost to Sarasota and boom! The car dies again. Now we can’t believe it. Again, God was with us and we were able to make it off an exit ramp. Ked called the tow truck and I called Grandma. She can’t believe it. So I walk across the street to McDonald’s and Ked stays with the car. Just as the tow truck shows up the car starts! Now we’re getting annoyed. Grandma shows up, we all shake our heads and head to her place for breakfast.  We had a great day with her as Ked and I replaced the fans in her bathroom. Ked was covered in dust and his arms were tired from being above his head, but we successfully replaced the fans in both her bathrooms. Unfortunately, the holes from the old fans are bigger than the hole for the new fans, so Ked will be making some trim and taking it back down to cover the hole. That is, if we can ever make it back down there.  It was a cold and rainy day, but we decided to head back to our place. What should have been an hour trip took us four hours. The car broke down halfway and we sat alongside the road for at least an hour. We called a tow truck, but true to form, it started again before the tow truck arrived. We drive twenty minutes more and it stops again. This time we decide NOT to call a tow truck and wait it out. Obviously, something is overheating and it just needs to cool down and it starts again. By now, we are tired, dirty and frustrated. And we start to doubt God. It’s amazing how something like this can make you question your foundation. And so we talk. Why does this always happen to us? In our seven year marriage we’ve been stranded alongside the road more times than I can count, and it’s not like we drive junker cars. And we start to doubt all kinds of things, like God’s faithfulness to us, why He hasn’t blessed us more in the area of finances, and so on and so on. We’ve been sitting there an hour and the car still won’t start. This time we’re afraid it’s not going to start again. But in that time as we’ve talked we’ve realized where our faith is weak. If something really so silly and stupid as a car breaking down (fact of life, they just aren’t reliable) we need to re-evaluate where we stand in our faith. So we prayed together, not for the car to be healed, but for our faith to be healed. We desire so desperately to be used by God. To do something marvelous for Him, to use all of our potential, and to hear “well done, good and faithful servant!” And so our time in the car gave us time to reflect and ask God not to hide His plan for us, and to help us live our lives to the fullest for Him, even when we’re broken down alongside the road. Finally after an hour, I have to go to the bathroom REALLY bad. Actually, I’ve had to go for quite awhile. So we call for help and arrange for a tow truck to come and get us. And would you believe it? Ked hangs up the phone and tries the car one more time, and it starts right up. We look at each other in amazement.   Was God just trying to tell us to ask for help? I don’t know if He works in ways like that, but it seems to be a good illustration. Just pick up the phone – get on your knees and ask Me for help! If we learned anything by our three hours by the roadside, it’s that we aren’t alone, even when we feel like it, and sometimes we just need to reach out and ask for help.  We finally made it home, exhausted, drained and ready for bed.                "

2372,Virgo,"               I was on the bus today, coming home from work, and this woman got on the bus.  She must have been in her late fifties, maybe early sixties, and she started asking the driver questions where he was going, whih is fair enough, so he told her.  He was obviously going where she wanted him to, so she made to go and sit down.  He gently reminded her that she hadn't paid yet, and she looked at him like he was stupid and said 'I've got a pass.' in a very snotty tone of voice.  The driver was very polite and just said that he would have to see it before she could go and sit down, so she made this big show of having a hurt arm and putting her bag down before she could get her pass out.  (A few seconds later she was holding onto the bar with both arms as the bus drove off quite happily, so her arm can't have been that bad).  Anyway, she only went a few stops, and as she was getting off the bus she turned to the driver and was really snotty and nasty to him saying things like 'I'm from the honest generation', and 'you're obviously not an honest man to see dishonesty in me' blah de blah de blah.  The rest of the passengers on the bus were like 'Oh shut up you silly mare, he's only doing his job.'  What annoyed me most was the fact that she said 'I'm from THE honest generation', like all the rest of us were untrustworthy thieving liars.  Personally I don't think there is such a thing as an honest generation.  There are always going to be good people and bad people in any generation, people who will help others, and those who are out for all they can get and will try to get away with anything.  There are just as many eldrly shop lifters as there are young ones, it's just the elderly ones tend to get away with it more... Things to be grateful for: 1.  Regaining my muse and being able to write again. 2.  Not being so self obsessed and snobbish to think I don't have to show my pass when I'm getting on a bus because the 'driver should know I'm an honest citizen' 3.  having my blog to write in to keep me sane (ish)          "
2373,Leo,             and the dreams continue...         
2374,Gemini,"            TELLY COMPAS POINTS NORTH   And so, as my plane took to the heavens, I found myself looking whistfully out the window, just like Harper at the end of Angels in America. With a sigh, I began to think about the fact I was going home. To the familiar. To the ground I'd treaded many times before.  It was much the same feeling I got when watching the new FOX series North Shore. While it was watchable, it felt far too familiar to be interesting. Like getting home from the airport and entering a musty house, you just want to open up some windows to freshen the place up a little.   So, what's it about?  Welcome to North Shore. A ritzy hotel resort on an island in Hawaii. We follow the staff (a bar tender, poolboy, waitress, and the shows leads of whom are presumably working as resort managers) as they find themselves involved in the lives of the patrons at the resort. I much prefered the series when it was called The Love Boat.   Who's in the darn thing?  Seemingly half the cast of Baywatch Hawaii, so already we know that we're going to be reaching new heights of televised greatness. Of note to audiences are former Baywatch actress Brooke Burke, and  character actor  urlLink James Remar .  A perculiar aspect to the series is that one of the shows producers is listed as Chris Brancato, a producer primarily known for working with genre series like Tru Calling and First Wave.   What happens in the first episode?  The somewhat uninteresting and verging on bland lead male actor is quite happy with his life until the day his ex-girlfriend (Brooke Burke) rocks up to share his job with him. Meanwhile, he finds himself being used by the PR agent of a foxy tennis sensation staying at the resort. In other happenings, the pool boy is accused of sexually interfering with a 15 year old patron.  By the end, everyone faces an emotional realisation and leaves the hotel feeling better about their lives.   But is it any good?  It'll likely get a season or two out of production, but it's no more involving than a standard Aaron Spelling piece of trash. The Hawaii setting is its greatest asset, but is simply not being used to its full potential. It's beautiful as hell to look at, but when you consider the way the state was used as a location in the recent film Blue Crush, as well as the TV series The Byrds of Paradise, disappointment seeps in. In Blue Crush & Byrds, Hawaii's people and culture played an integral part of visual flavour of the series. Instead, North Shore may as well just be set on a resort in LA somewhere. It's simply scantily dressed US whiteys as far as the eye can see.  North Shore is easy viewing. But at the same time it's very disposable. I can't see there'd be many people buying DVD box sets in a few years.            "

Cracking open a finger-sized stick of ''Fat in Chocolate'' reveals exactly that: a vein of white fat.

Wellener's son, Paul, and widow, Mary Ann, bought three pairs of stadium seats for $2,100 at an auction — and knew they had found the perfect gravestone.          "

2379,Capricorn,"             Today I called Mr. Laskey since he told me to call him on Monday at about 1:30 PM or so.&nbsp; Well, I called him at 2:10 PM because I was in the car with my parents and I didn't know when we were going to stop again.&nbsp; So I took out my cellphone and dialed his cellphone number.&nbsp; Well, when he picked up, he screamed and started yelling at something.&nbsp; I thought he was yelling at his kids or something.&nbsp; Something not so important.&nbsp; And there was silence.&nbsp; So I hung up.  Later when we stopped at Target, I called him again and I was informed that he just got into a car accident.&nbsp; I felt so bad.&nbsp; I thought I had caused it.&nbsp; But he assured me it wasn't my fault.&nbsp; I just had really bad timing.&nbsp; I just called to check that Thursday was still okay.&nbsp; Last Thursday, I stayed extra long to make up for the previous Thursday's absense.&nbsp; The previous Thrusday, Mr. Laskey didn't show up.&nbsp; He said that he lost my phone number so he couldn't have called me.&nbsp; So there I was at the high school and I was free for an hour.&nbsp; So I decided to go to the auditorium and play.  It was awesome.&nbsp; The acoustics in that room was steller.&nbsp;   Last Thursday, Mr. Laskey introduced me to another scale.&nbsp; This time, I went into seventh position.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; Its really high.&nbsp; When it gets that high, I have a hard time remembering the note names.&nbsp; The notes pretty much only get recognized by the finger I use to play them.&nbsp; I should work on that.&nbsp; Especially with half and whole steps.&nbsp; Laskey also advanced me on the Viotti piece.&nbsp; Its pretty good.&nbsp; The way I was playing it before was different that the way he told me to play it.&nbsp; He told me to use third position on the A string.&nbsp; Which I guess makes more sense.&nbsp; Although my fourth finger G is always out of tune.&nbsp; My fourth finger is always out of tune for any note.

2381,Aries,           baak?         
2382,Cancer,"           I've been watching the show Room Raiders on MTV lately, well ok since like September, but ya I really like the show, not because it's a dating show and what not, but because it shows people's rooms and how they express themselves. I also think it's pretty cool that there are people picking their dates based off of the personalities of the room, ok most of them do, some of them just go on the amount of porn or thongs they have. But anyways, it really is pretty interesting to see a persons personality through their room. First of all if someone is like omg I'm so not like that anymore and I don't even like thos band memebers anymore..... that still shows something about your personality. Sure you may not have those same interests anymore and the people may not know that, but if that's the case it does show that you don't really like change or that you're too lazy to change anything. It shows that you're still living in the past or never home to really care. No matter how creative your room is or how messy it is, it shows your personality some way. It'll show if you're unkempt, it'll show if you're creative, and it'll show your way of life. My room for example is dark blue with white sheets and what not throughout the room, I have a lot of pictures and have set my room up so things match and fit well. My room will show that I like memories and I like expressing my creative ability through my room and ya if someone goes through my draws they'll get my sense of style. That and I am kind of messy. I just really think it's funny and really interesting actually how much you can actually express yourself through your room. Your room is your own, it's the place that brings the best of you because it's all yours. I see it as a place that should really best represent yourself then anything else, it's your home. Thus Room Raiders to me is quit appealing. If I were to get set up on a date, that's how I would want to. Who ever came up with the idea, nice, very nice.   Phobias are really interesting, really weird too. I don't even know how people pick them up, sure someone may have had a terrifying experience, which would make sense as to why they're a freakishly afraid of something, but other things people don't really have a reason, they're just there. Me for example, I'm terrified of bugs and spiders, like seriously I'll freak out and cry if one is on me or anything. Just like 10 min I was sitting on my couch and I felt something on me and I look and there is a spider crawling on me. I throw my book out of my hands and jump up and down and then run away freaking out, good thing it came off of me that sec 'cause if it hadn't I would have started crying not joking. Say I'm being held done and someone is putting some bug on me, I'll cry then too and have a panic attack. Seriously why am I afraid? I haven't had a deathy experience with bugs and they can't exactly harm  me, well at least most bugs in Minnesota. I just have grown up with a this thought of bugs that someone they will harm me, I don't know. Again phobias really just don't make sense. Then again nothing really makes sense in this world.  Love Actually is a very high quality movie, I've seen it twice in theater and I recommend it to everyone, especially for those who have an open heart. One concept from that movie that I really liked though, was the airport one. Actually, it was kind of false too. The movie showed and talked about how much joy is brought about from an airport and the arrivals of people. So much love is expressed and there's no where else where such love is felt. It's incredibly true, airports do bring joy, doesn't matter if you're visiting someone or anything, but the joy of just being at a certain place brings more love to just that individual too. However, the other side to this concept is missed. Airports also represent broken hearts, and sadness, the feeling of unable to forget and the feeling of the joy that was just experienced slipping through your hands. So many people cry in airports, yes many do cry of joy, but many do cry of the depature. I'm guilty of this too, I have cryed a lot in airports because I didn't want to leave. I've gone some place for like a week and have had so much fun that I didn't want to go back to my life at home and go back to reality. It's so hard to say goodbye, but at airports you have too, airports give you that moment you cherish and that one moment you always set aside and try to forget. Although you may be crying of sadness due to the love you had, it's still a broken heart. Airports will either mend your broken heart, or leave it so vulnerable to be broken again.   For the first time like ever I was able to walk out of a sappy movie all about love, and say I can't be sad I do have a boyfriend, I do have that love..... that was weird, but it still felt incredibly good, I can't complain anymore.   Never go to a library on a saturday afternoon, surprisingly a lot of people go there.

2383,Gemini,"        Hi, everyone sorry about the lack of updates...  With any free time when I'm not working I try to spend some time with Kat & the kids.  Of course, I'm playing games and games too!   City of Heroes & the new Marvel CCG from Upper Deck... VS. System.  So thats what I've been filling any spare time with.  Oh, Kat & a few of my friends went to see 'Van Helsing' at the Ultra Screen here in Appleton on Saturday night.  Action, action, & more action was the order of the day!  The special effects were great, & Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing ruled.  It's not as bad as some reviewers might lead you to believe, & it might not be worth it for full price at the theatre if your not into horror monster movies... But, it was worth it for me & everyone that went.  So you be the judge.  Definately worth a rental when it comes to DVD.  The summer is right around the corner & my vacation went by waaaaay to fast.  At Taco John's I'll be able to reduce my hours over the summer to 1 or 2 days a week so I can see my kids and hang out more.  I definately want to get into playing basketball again.  Sooooo... if any of my friends wants to hoop it up shoot me an email or give me a yell on the old telephone.  It's good for the bod, and it's getting out of the house... *hint*  *hint*  I signed up for the Everquest 2 BETA at the official site the other day.  Who knows?  Maybe I'll get lucky and get a chance to play it sooner than later?  I'm also looking forward to that new movie 'The Day After Tomorrow' that comes out the end of May.  Hopefully it will be good, I really like disaster movies, Armagedon, Deep Impact, Dantes Peak, Volcano, & of course Twister my favorite of them all.  Just something about nature woopin up on mankind that I just cant resist!  My wife Kat now owns the 2nd & 3rd season of CSI on DVD.  Now thats a show that I never really watched before, & I actually do enjoy it now!  Have to get her the 1st season.  She loves watching them.  I'd like to continue my collection of Buffy The Vampire Slayer on DVD, I have the 1st season of that TV series that I've had for nearly 2 years now, just have to get off my butt & take the plunge & start getting the rest!  This past Saturday, I had my children (Jordan & Casey) & instead of going to a movie or something else we stopped at a local store 'Gordmans' & bought them both new shoes.  They loved it!  I know I'm the same way whenever I get something new, makes you feel good.   With this being the last season of 'Angel' the TV series, I'll have to find another show to watch.  Sucks that the series was cancelled, but oh well all my favorites are vanishing from the air waves.  Still, I can watch 'Smallville' & 'CSI', so all is not lost.  Well, enough ramblings... Anyone else want to see 'Day After Tomorrow'??   *May The Force Be With You*           "

2385,Gemini,"           The Band:  urlLink The 5678's .  Location:  The Zoo , Fortitude Valley.  Time: After 11pm-ish  We'd gotten there late. Had enough time to wander around the venue. Used the mens room where I learnt the important life lesson that a sink isn't just for washing your hands, but it's also a novel place to piss. Thanks drunken cockhead. We bought ourselves some drinks, then headed towards the front of the stage. Just one row of people in, we sat through the non-inspiring blandness that is  urlLink The Tremors .   A sense of excitement-based energy had swept the venue. It was an odd moment to behold. Lets be honest, most people were at the gig having only known the band from seeing the film  urlLink Kill Bill.    I turned to my buddy and remarked 'This could quite possibly be one of the coolest acts we will ever see'. And oddly, I was right.     Dressed like tinsel christmas ornaments, the 5678's took to the stage and caused the audience to rock and bop like I never thought possible. Am I gushing? Perhaps so, but it was just such a darn cool experience. I started grinning like an idiot.   Which is when things began to get a little rough. Now, I've been to some shows with crowds a little on the tough side. I've been pushed around and battered by the crowds at the front of the stage, so it's not as if it was a new experience. But of all places for a mosh pit to form, with crowd surfers, and a tsunami of people crushed against one another as they push from side to side, a 5678's gig was not where I'd expected it to happen. Those girls seem to do crazy things to the kids.  Should you ever have the opportunity, get your arse there ASAP.  Woo Hoo indeed.         "

2390,Sagittarius,"       Every time I have a discussion or share a thought process of mine, I feel like I've gone on a rollercoaster of learning and experience. When I get the chance to interact with certain people I realize that I should be happy to be who I think I am. There are always thoughts of my past, reflections of who I thought I once was and solutions I felt would fix everything.  Today as I walked through the card section of Superstore, I stumbled across the 'With Our Deepest Sympathy' I felt a twinge of what would have happened if those pills really had killed me. Would my sister have recieved cards in honour of her pathetic big sister who felt that she couldn't handle the world? Would my parents have recieved gotti flowers and such? Would my friends have thought about the lack of me, and then figured 'screw it'. Then I snapped out of this thought, and just walked on to the cooking chicken section. It's strange how certain events still trigger the deepest memories in your mind. I do not believe that I am sucidal but I can honestly admit that I am clinically depressed which seems like a cope out some days. Days when all I want to do is lie in bed and cry, eat ice cream and tell everyone to fuck off...who knows.   The Future is Fake   An interesting quote that I found in the book I'm currently reading. True.  My deepest fear, is not public speaking, spiders of bugs, but actually people and their emotions and their baggage. People scare me but there are certain people that I adore. I am glad I have this oppurinity to go through this change in me because it feels like something that needs to be done. Another interesting point about my life, is that I've never had the same friends for more than three years...which I'm a little nervous about considering that this is my third year of YP approaching.   I think the best thing that I've heard all day was just to not get involved in the bullshit cause thats what it is. Believe in who you are as a person and well, you'll have to depend on yourself to get yourself across the galaxy.  There are some people in this world that do not recieve the full amount of credit they deserve, and I feel I've found someone like this which I haven't been kind enough to. I apolgize for whatever harm I may have caused, but thank you for your kindness. ...Remember when....  There are some people that I would like to talk to eventually but I refuse to push it. I am sitting here waiting, no for you only but for a chance of talking, a chance to spend time with you.   ....Remember when...  My eyes are getting slighty sore and I think it's time to crawl into bed.     "
2391,Aquarius,"       Ahh, little Elizabeth Bishop was so right.  So, I've lost my keys.  They are in North Carolina.  I am not.  I didn't realize I didn't have them until I awoke from the early morning drive back to my parents' house.  Many phone calls later, they are hopefully being fedexed to me and will arrive Tuesday sometime.  I'm trapped at my parents' house which isn't bad except when you want to be in your home, you want to be in your home.  And I, want to be in my home.  Say some prayers people, may fedex not lose THAT package.  I've never lost my keys before and really it's not a huge deal though it may look like (WRITE it) like disaster.         "
2392,Scorpio,"              A Trip Down Memory Lane  Taking my own advice, I revisited the posts I'd written when I first started. I just realised I've been with Blogger for almost exactly TWO WHOLE YEARS now!!! Can ya believe it? hehehe....  Reading the trials and tribulations of uni life brought a smile to my lips teehee. And reminded me of the anguish of assignments etc, and having my  sacre bleau!!  iBook damaged. Those were the days.  Thankfully Azalea, my trusty iBook has served me well in the last 3 years. Only the battery's shot, 'coz of the 'overcharging' I did to her. Basically, Azalea functions more as a desktop rather than a laptop nowadays...but she's still pretty!  I think the new look has really inspired me to blog/write/journal again! It's amazing what a little greenery can do to jumpstart a floundering writing career!  Ok, ok. I reeeeeally need to go sleep now.  urlLink Alex  my man, I hear ya. Blogging is highly addictive, especially when one should be doing something else...          "
2393,Gemini,"   All the things I could have said Now are running through my head. All my thoughts seem to die and all you have done for me is lie. I can't seem to find the words to force down these swords, of hatred and grief. I cannot convey this one belief. Could you be the one?, lifting me back toward the sun. This world is hard as stone, expecially when feeling so alone. All I ever wanted was to be close to you, but I never could see what I needed to do.  Never to return from a point so low, I have decided to just let go... "
2394,Scorpio,"       Its amazing how some of the littlest things can change your point of view.   I've been in a much better mood lately {which unfortunately means less to write about...}  and I can't decided if its because of the lovely weather, or because of Sean.  Probably both.  and the other day Mr. Thomas suggested that he thinks going to MU {University of Missouri, Columbia} would be really good for me.  His opinion means a lot to me.  Therefore, I am going to visit there next week, during spring break. He also said that one of the photos I took for the issue that's coming out tomorrow is the best I've had published all year.    Tonight I went to a Lenten prayer service at church.  They played a video on poverty around the world.  It was terribly depressing.  If I give up all the things I own, how would that help the  people who live in garbage dumps in South America?  Could I sell my car, and donate the money from it, and the gas money I would save to a charity?  I don't think I could.   I'm too selfish.  The thought makes me sick to my stomach.   I do feel a little less stressed though...  I got some good prayer time in.  I always feel so much cleaner after I've prayed.  Lately, my prayers have just been letting my thoughts flow through my head,  opening them to God, and dwelling on people who I care about,  who need my prayers, and who I am thankful for.  Then I've fallen into my faults.  I wish there was some way I could force myself to be more selfless.  I want to exist soley for the good of others, but somehow I always fall back to doing things for my own good, and taking care of my wants.  I feel guilty for wanting so many things, especially when I know how little they really matter.  I also feel guilty for needing so much attention.  So much of what I do is to get the attention and compliments of others.  Does any of the good I do for this  purpose even really count?  I talk about people behind their backs, and I judge people based on the way they look or talk.    Honestly?  I think I really am a terrible person. God help me.    "
2395,Aquarius,"       Woke up around 11:30 which really not that late, but considering it was drunk sleep, it was far to early.  Too much bachelorette partying.  My head hurt and I felt like a ton of bricks hit me so back to bed I went at 2 pm for a long nap.  I don't even know how I got that drunk or if I was that drunk.  I didn't drink that much, although people were handing us shots all night, but those fruity shots don't have much alcohol in them.  And, I had my wits about me at the end of the night.  I was probbably the most sobber one there.  So, what the hell with the hangover?  Anyway, it's currently 5pm and I need to get on with my day, or what's left of it.           "
